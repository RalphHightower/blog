Senator Lindsey Graham
290 Russell Senate Office Building
Washington, DC 20510

Dear [Senator Lindsey Graham](https://lgraham.senate.gov/)

There. I fixed it. Your Senate Oath of Office:

*I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend Trump, his businesses, his sons, daughter, and son-in-law against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation grudgingly, under threats and coercion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter: So help me Trump.*

It took the death of Senator John McCain, Republican from Arizona, to realize that without McCain 
that you are constitutionally, ethically, and morally bankrupt, just like President Trump; you, sir, 
have gone *“bat-shit crazy”.* The Republican Party died in July 2016 when it chose a person with zero 
qualifications or the temperament to be president; it is now the Trump Party. Trump is trying to 
run America like his family owned business.

From 1972 up to 2018, I was an independent voter; never drinking the Flavor Aid (ref: Jonestown 
Massacre) of either party; but since there are no Republicans, only Trumpers, I voted straight ticket 
in November 2018. I will not consider a vote for Republicans until sanity returns to the party.
Trump committed impeachable acts before the aid to Ukraine. I just wish that the ‘Republicans’ in 
the Senate were interested in the truth and protecting and defending the Constitution and America. 
Bolton, Mulvaney, Giuliani, and others that Trump has ordered to not testify before the House must 
testify in front of the Senate. Trump needs to face an impartial jury, but that is not going to happen 
since you are not interested in the truth and McConnell stated as such.

Sincerely,

Ralph Hightower
