## [Pro-Trump Republicans gearing up for fresh effort to undermine 2024 presidential election](https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/10/06/pro-trump-republicans-gearing-up-for-fresh-effort-to-undermine-2024-presidential-election/)

Story by Dave Goldiner, New York Daily News. October 6, 2024.

- **Election Interference**: Republican supporters of Trump are preparing to challenge the 2024 election results if he loses to Kamala Harris, with efforts to delay or invalidate votes in battleground states.
- **Legal Preparations**: The GOP has a larger and better-prepared team of election lawyers compared to 2020.
- **New Voting Rules**: In Georgia, new rules requiring hand counts of ballots could delay certification or invalidate votes, potentially causing chaos.
- **Security Concerns**: Increased threats of violence against election officials have led to heightened security measures.

To those Trump Party *"Republicans"*, below is your oath of office! Honor it! Any representative or senator that interferes with the election results should be **impeached!**
