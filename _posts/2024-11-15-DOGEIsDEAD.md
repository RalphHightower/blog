## [Vivek Ramaswamy wants to start DOGE cuts by eliminating funding for unauthorized programs - including veteran healthcare](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/vivek-ramaswamy-doge-veteran-healthcare-funding-b2647484.html)

Story by Kelly Rissman. November 14, 2024.

[Trump](https:x.com/realdonaldtrump) sycophants, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, were rewarded for their support of [Trump](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump) to lead the newly-created Department of Government Efficiency, proposed defunding federal programs that no longer have congressional authorization - which includes money for veterans’ health care, [NASA](hhttps://www.nasa.gov/) and early education.

Fortunately, DOGE Is not a government agency and bound to get blowback. Getting rid of veterans health benefits will unleash a firestorm. [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) is essential for space research, exploration, which benefits Earth. [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) is safe since legislators s view [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) as a jobs program for their state even though it is **America'sspace program.** [NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov/) will be on the chopping block because Trumpers don't believe science, but it monitors our atmosphere and oceans. A number of administrations ago, one senator wanted [NOAA's](https://www.noaa.gov) [National Weather Service](https://nws.noaa.gov/) forecasts to be private which would benefit a private weather company in their state.

The new office, nicknamed DOGE after co-leader Elon Musk’s favorite meme, will operate “outside of government” and will aim to “cut wasteful expenditures and restructure Federal Agencies.” Two days after being nominated, Ramaswamy suggested deep cuts to federal funding, starting with a list of expired authorizations of appropriations.

Some congressional funding was approved with a set time before authorization expired. However, they continue to receive funding. A recent report by the Congressional Budget Office found more than 1,200 programs at more than $516 billion a year. When an authorization expires, Congress can extend the program through new legislation or by providing new appropriations, according to CBO.

“We shouldn’t let the government spend money on programs that have expired. Yet that’s exactly what happens today: half a *trillion* dollars of taxpayer funds (\$516 B+) goes each year to programs which Congress has allowed to expire. There are 1,200+ programs that are no longer authorized but still receive appropriations. This is totally nuts. We can & should save hundreds of billions each year by defunding government programs that Congress no longer authorizes. We’ll challenge any politician who disagrees to defend the other side. If it doesn’t advance the interests of American citizens, we’re putting it on the chopping block. Amazingly, there are a number of programs whose authorization from Congress has *already expired* yet \$\$\$ still flows out the door. That needs to end next year.” – Vivek Ramaswamy

Social media users were quick to point out some of the programs that received funding despite lacking current Congressional authorization. One is the Veterans’ Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996, which helps provide funding for veterans’ medical care. The authorization expired in 1998, but still receives about \$120 billion in funding.

It was hardly the only notable agency that could see a funding stream tried up. Others included a bill that helped NASA and the International Space Station. Another area was tied to Head Start, which helps provide early childhood education to low-income students.

It’s unclear if Ramaswamy knew the specific programs that he could potentially cut or if he would exempt any.

Both Ramaswamy and Musk have been tasked to lead the Trump-created agency that will look to curb government spending. Musk has estimated that \$2 trillion can be axed from the federal payroll.

“We are very grateful to the thousands of Americans who have expressed interest in helping us at DOGE. We don’t need more part-time idea generators. We need super high-IQ small-government revolutionaries willing to work 80+ hours per week on unglamorous cost-cutting. If that’s you, DM this account with your CV. Elon & Vivek will review the top 1% of applicants.”
– DOGE wrote on X on Thursday.

Musk admitted that the working conditions at DOGE aren’t exactly typical. “This will be tedious work, make lots of enemies & compensation is zero. What a great deal!”
