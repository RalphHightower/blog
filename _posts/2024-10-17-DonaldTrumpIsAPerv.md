## Donald Trump is a Perv and Voyuer

Apparently, since Trump owned the Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA pageants, he thought that it was his right to walk into their dressing rooms. Many women and teenage girls were in various states of undress, ranging from topless to totally nude.

Several former Miss USA and Miss Teen USA contestants accused Trump of entering the dressing rooms of beauty pageant contestants while contestants were in various stages of undress. Trump had already referred to this practice during a 2005 interview on The Howard Stern Show, saying he could "get away with things like that" because he owned the Miss Universe franchise. In October 2019, the book All the President's Women: Donald Trump and the Making of a Predator contained 43 additional allegations of sexual misconduct against Trump[^411]

Trump has denied all the allegations against him, saying he has been the victim of media bias, conspiracies, and a political smear campaign. In October 2016, Trump publicly vowed to sue all the women who have made allegations of sexual misconduct against him, as well as The New York Times for publishing the allegations.[^412]
