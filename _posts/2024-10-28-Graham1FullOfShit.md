[Graham (T-SC)](https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/) further struck back on Kelly’s "fascist" comment, asking Americans to look at Trump’s record as "a friend of Israel unlike any other" and how he helped put Israel "in the strongest position they’ve been in." He also said there were no wars, the border was at its most secure and inflation was down, all on Trump’s watch.

[Graham (T-SC)](https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/) was also asked about criticisms that retired four-star Gens. Mark Milley and Jim Mattis, who both served in the Trump administration, also made about the former president.[^31]

In fact, former House Republican Conference Chair Liz Cheney has held some public events with Harris, including one in Wisconsin in which Charlie Sykes — an MSNBC Daily columnist and conservative media host who’s also broken with his party and backed Harris — reminded the former Wyoming congresswoman about [Lindsey Graham (T-SC)](https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/)’s on-air comments, and asked for her reaction.

“Well, don’t listen to [Lindsey Graham (T-SC)](https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/),” Cheney responded. “It’s good life advice, actually.”

It was a funny line, and it generated some applause from the audience, but that’s not all Cheney has had to say on the matter. In fact, at the same event, Cheney also said, “If you wouldn’t ... hire somebody to babysit your kids, you shouldn’t make that guy president of the United States. In this election, we need to elect the person who is the responsible adult.” – Liz Cheney (R-WY)
