Graham further struck back on Kelly’s "fascist" comment, asking Americans to look at Trump’s record as "a friend of Israel unlike any other" and how he helped put Israel "in the strongest position they’ve been in." He also said there were no wars, the border was at its most secure and inflation was down, all on Trump’s watch.

Graham was also asked about criticisms that retired four-star Gens. Mark Milley and Jim Mattis, who both served in the Trump administration, also made about the former president.[^31]
