excerpt: "Cruz could have supported the peaceful transfer of power in the 2020 presidential election. He instead was the first senator to rise in objection to certifying the electoral vote and one of just six to do so. His actions were a catalyst for what became one of the worst days in our nation's history."

- **Polls**: Recent polls show a **close race** between [Cruz (T-TX)](https://www.cruz.senate.gov/) and Allred, with [Cruz (T-TX)](https://www.cruz.senate.gov/) leading by a narrow margin.

Allred endorsements:

- Houston Chronicle
- San Antonio Express-News
- Fort Worth Star-Telegram.

Editorial Excerpts from from Dallas Morning News:

- "We looked not only at their actions but also listened to their words, and, after doing so, we recommend voters cast their ballots for Allred in the coming election."
- [Cruz (T-TX)](https://www.cruz.senate.gov/) had "long embraced the politics of division" and on items of crucial importance to the country, he "digs in the most partisan mode possible, making no room for common ground." 
- Noted [Cruz's (T-TX)](https://www.cruz.senate.gov/) opposition to the bipartisan border deal, the CHIPs and Science Act, and the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act—all of which Allred supported.
- Criticized [Cruz (T-TX)](https://www.cruz.senate.gov/) for his support of former President Donald Trump's efforts to overturn President Joe Biden's 2020 victory.
- [Cruz (T-TX)](https://www.cruz.senate.gov/) "could have supported the peaceful transfer of power in the 2020 presidential election.
- He instead was the first senator to rise in objection to certifying the electoral vote and one of just six to do so. His actions were a catalyst for what became one of the worst days in our nation's history."

Allred:

- Cited Allred's record of bipartisanship, saying he has "demonstrated over time that both the words and action of bipartisanship matter to him."

Common Cause:

- Common Ground Committee has twice named him the most bipartisan member of Congress and that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has "singled him out for bipartisan work."
- Allred "speaks and acts in ways that demonstrate he is willing to treat differences as things we overcome, rather than root in."
- "And on the most important issues we face, he is willing to compromise in the name of solutions and moving forward together. For that reason, we think he is the better choice."
