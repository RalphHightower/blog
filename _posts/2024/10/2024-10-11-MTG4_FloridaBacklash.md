## [Florida Democrat Shuts Down Marjorie Taylor Greene And Her Hurricane Conspiracy 'Machine'](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jared-moskowitz-marjorie-taylor-greene-hurricane-conspiracy_n_6706df96e4b0c34b3eb98ea9)

- **Misinformation**: Rep. Jared Moskowitz criticized Rep. [Marjorie Taylor Greene (T-GA14)](https://greene.house.gov/) for spreading dangerous misinformation about weather control during Hurricane Milton.
- **Political Response**: President Joe Biden condemned both Greene and former President Donald Trump for their disinformation regarding hurricane relief efforts.
- **Impact on Public**: Moskowitz highlighted the risks of misinformation, especially during emergencies, and stressed the need for accurate information to ensure public safety.
- **Disaster Politics**: The article discusses the ongoing issue of "disaster politics" and how it affects emergency management and public perception.

Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.) scorched Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (T-GA14)
on Wednesday as Hurricane Milton hit his home state.
“And then obviously, we have my favorite, Marjorie Taylor Greene, who
runs the Mensa caucus, talking about the fact that we have a weather
machine. If there are aliens watching and they’re looking at all of this,
they can definitely confirm there is no intelligent life in Congress with
Marjorie Taylor Greene talking about a weather machine being used for
politics. It’s very dangerous. There’s always been “disaster politics in the
emergency management industry. We saw it in Katrina, dealt with it in
COVID, obviously, but the misinformation that we’re seeing being put out
now is very dangerous. I mean, at some point in time, we’ll see people
tell residents not to evacuate because the hurricane’s not really hitting
you, and that’s really where it’s headed.”

On Wednesday, President Joe Biden went after both Greene and former
President Donald Trump for their part in pushing “disinformation” about
the federal government’s response to hurricanes:

- “We’re controlling the weather! It’s beyond ridiculous. It’s got to stop."
