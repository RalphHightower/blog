excerpt: "I do not have faith that Mike Johnson will fulfill his constitutional obligations and if you look at what he did in 2020. He knew and he knew with specificity that claims of fraud that Donald Trump was making and that he was repeating, he knew those to be false...I think it's very concerning and I do think that Donald Trump has consistently said in the last few months that this election is going to be rigged and if he loses that's why. So, I think it's very important the Republicans not be a majority in the House come January 2025. Liz Cheney, former Representative(R-WI) to Meet The Press host, Kristen Welker if she had faith that this election will be free and fair and that there will be peaceful transfer of power."

- **Liz Cheney's Warning**: Former Representative Liz Cheney warns about the GOP controlling Congress next year, expressing concerns over election security and the peaceful transfer of power.
- **Trump's Claims**: Former President Donald Trump continues to claim that the 2020 election was "rigged" and has not conceded his loss.
- **Election Security**: President Biden and other officials emphasize the importance of a free and fair election, with bipartisan efforts to ensure the certification of the 2024 election results.
- **Unity Commitment**: A bipartisan initiative led by Representatives Josh Gottheimer and Don Bacon aims to promote calm and respect for election results.

"I do not have faith that Mike Johnson will fulfill his constitutional obligations and if you look at what he did in 2020. He knew and he knew with specificity that claims of fraud that Donald Trump was making and that he was repeating, he knew those to be false...I think it's very concerning and I do think that Donald Trump has consistently said in the last few months that this election is going to be rigged and if he loses that's why. So, I think it's very important the Republicans not be a majority in the House come January 2025," she said.
Meet The Press, host Kristen Welker asked Cheney if she has "faith that this election will be free and fair and that there will be peaceful transfer of power."

The House speaker responded: "We are going to do our job in Congress, a free and fair legal election will be certified and that is our hope and prayer across the board. Of course, I'm going to follow our Constitution, I'm going to follow the law. It's my job, it's my duty, I took an oath to do that."

Welker pushed back, pointing out that Trump has yet to concede the 2020 results, asking, "When people hear you say if it is free and fair, does that not undermine people's confidence in the election results?"

Johnson said, "No it shouldn't because what I'm saying is what the Constitution provides...the point is the process work, we have the peaceful transfer of power, we did in 2020, we will in 2024. Everybody can sigh and take a deep breath. Our system is going to work."

New Jersey Democratic Representative Josh Gottheimer said in a release in September that he launched the initiative along with Nebraska Republican Representative Don Bacon to "demonstrate true leadership ahead of this critical election and serve as a voice for calm."

Bacon added: "In America we respect election results especially once the courts and appeals work through the process...We fight hard to win during campaigns and then respect the results when the votes are counted. We are the greatest country in the world, and we are governed by the rule of law. The citizens are sovereign, and they decide." The collective effort of Bacon and Gottheimer's initiative is called the "Unity Commitment."

The lawmakers also agreed to serve "as a voice for calm and reconciliation and speaking out against those who endorse or engage in violence that harms people, property, or public spaces."

@RalphHightower: Lord, I hope there is a peaceful transfer of power. As John Micklethwait, Editor-in-chief of Bloomberg News told Trump at the Q&A session at the Economic Club of Chicago: "You had a peaceful transfer of power? Come on President Trump, you had had a peaceful transfer of power compared to Venezuela. But it was by far the most, the worst transfer of power for a long time."[^11]
