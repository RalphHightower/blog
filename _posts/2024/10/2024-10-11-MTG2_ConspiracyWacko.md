## ["Loony tunes": House GOP infighting erupts over Marjorie Taylor Greene's hurricane comments](https://www.axios.com/2024/10/10/mtg-hurricane-milton-helene-house-republicans?)

Story by Andrew Solender. October 10, 2024.

- **Internal Conflict**: House Republicans are clashing, particularly over Rep. [Marjorie Taylor Greene (T-GA14)](https://greene.house.gov/)'s claims that humans can control the weather.
- **Greene's Controversial Statements**: Greene's social media posts about weather control during hurricanes have sparked backlash from her colleagues.
- **Rebukes from Colleagues**: Several House Republicans, including Reps. Carlos Gimenez and Chuck Edwards, have publicly refuted [Greene's (T-GA)](https://greene.house.gov/) claims.
- **Ongoing Tensions**: [Greene (T-GA)](https://greene.house.gov/) has a history of causing friction within the House, leading to past disciplinary actions and widespread disapproval.

Said Rep. Don Bacon (T-NE): "I think enough has already been said. I ignore her."
"She thinks we have no impact on the climate but somehow control the weather,"
scoffed another House Republican. The lawmaker told Axios that [Greene (T-GA)](https://greene.house.gov/)'s beliefs
on the subject are "loony tunes" and said disgust with her recent comments is
widespread among House Republicans. Zoom out: [Greene (T-GA)](https://greene.house.gov/) has long had a unique
ability to anger House colleagues on both sides of the aisle, particularly
with her social media activities.

In 2021, 10 House Republicans – including Gimenez –
joined Democrats in voting to strip her of her committee assignments for past
posts advocating violence against prominent Democrats.

She was also kicked out of the House Freedom Caucus
last year for criticizing some of her fellow right-wingers
over their opposition to then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (T-CA).
