excerpt: "“This is unverified, un-cross-examined hearsay from grand jury testimony, which usually isn’t revealed publicly for that reason. He went to court. He asked for special permission to file a brief that’s four times as long as a normal brief and to have it disclosed less than 30 days before the election. This is professional misconduct in all likelihood by Jack Smith and it should be investigated. This is a perfect example of actual election interference, Jack Smith violating Department of Justice regulations to try to get out as much unverified so-called evidence as he has because he’s angry that he lost and the Democrats don’t think they can beat Donald Trump on issues like inflation and immigration.” Rep. Tom Cotton (T-AR) told “Meet the Press” host Kristen Welker."

**Former** President Trump has irreparably damaged our nation's peaceful transfer of power behaving as a spoiled brat and crybaby. Instead of gracefully attending the inauguration of President Biden, he sulked at his golf resort home, [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/). 

- **Unsealed Legal Brief**: A federal judge unsealed special counsel Jack Smith’s 165-page brief detailing Donald Trump’s alleged criminal activities related to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.
- **Sen. Tom Cotton's Response**: Cotton criticized the brief as “unverified hearsay” and accused Smith of professional misconduct.
- **Trump's Alleged Actions**: Smith argued Trump orchestrated criminal conspiracies and is not immune from charges, despite a Supreme Court ruling granting presidents broad immunity for official acts.
- **Election Interference Claims**: Cotton claimed the brief is an example of election interference and reiterated that Trump did not incite violence during the riots.

“This is unverified, un-cross-examined hearsay from grand jury testimony[^11], which usually isn’t revealed publicly for that reason. He went to court. He asked for special permission to file a brief that’s four times as long as a normal brief and to have it disclosed less than 30 days before the election.[^12] This is professional misconduct in all likelihood by Jack Smith and it should be investigated[^13]. This is a perfect example of actual election interference, Jack Smith violating Department of Justice regulations to try to get out as much unverified so-called evidence as he has because he’s angry that he lost and the Democrats don’t think they can beat Donald Trump on issues like inflation and immigration.” Se. Tom Cotton (T-AR) told “Meet the Press” host Kristen Welker.

[^11]: @RalphHightower: [Senator Tom Cotton](https://www.cotton.senate.gov/) should turn in his license to practice law. According to his Wikipedia page, [Tom Cotton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cotton?wprov=sfla1) is an attorney. He should know how grand juries work, and also know what the Supreme Court does. It can send cases back to lower courts. This is just **Bullshit grandstanding**.

[^12]: @RalphHightower: The only reason why the superceding federal indictment was filed this close to the election was because the John Roberts Supreme Court gave exceedingly broad *"presidential immunity"* to Donald Trump and sent the case back to the Federal DC Circuit Court.

[^13]: @RalphHightower: [Senator Tom Cotton](https://www.cotton.senate.gov/), Trump is indicted for attempting to overturn a fair election and inciting an insurrection/riot, causing significant damage to the United States Capitol. Participants included Q-Anon, Pride Boys, Zero Percenters, and Oath Losers.


### Planning of January 6 events[^21]

On December 18, four days after the Electoral College voted, Trump called for supporters to attend a rally before the January 6 Congressional vote count, writing on Twitter, "Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!".

### Unfucking Believable Trump's Tweet to Riot Is Still Online

[Donald J. Trump on X: "Peter Navarro releases 36-page report alleging election fraud 'more than sufficient' to swing victory to Trump https://t.co/D8KrMHnFdK. A great report by Peter. Statistically impossible to have lost the 2020 Election. Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!" / X](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1340185773220515840)
