excerpt: 'Just weeks before the November election, we are again reminded of the dangers of disinformation amplified by the ex-president. In the aftermath of Helene, North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein joined MSNBC’s “The Weekend” to address how Trump’s lies about FEMA undermine the government’s response in the western part of his state. “It’s devastating psychologically to those people because they now believe, some of them, that FEMA is going to be contrary to their interests rather than trying to help them get back on their feet.'

## [Trump thinks Americans have forgotten how bad his hurricane relief efforts were](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-hurricane-relief-milton-maria-paper-towels-rcna174836)

By Alicia Menendez, co-host of “The Weekend” and Lynox Norman. Oct. 11, 2024, 6:00 AM EDT.

This ain't the *United Red States of America* nor is it the *United Blue States of America.* Or the *"Divided States of America"*, although it sure seems like it.

This it the **UNITED STATES OF AMERICA![^11]**

[^11]: @RalphHightower: I apologize for a Trump use of all caps! **But this is important!**

When a large-scale disaster (hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes, tornadoes,  etc), strikes an area of the United States, be it one of the fifty states, or one of the territories, like Puerto Rico, residents turn to the federal government for help to assist with state and local governments in recovery. FEMA does not refuse aid or assistance based upon whether they are a Democrat or a *"Republican"[^12].*

[^12]: @RalphHightower: I use air-quotes around Republican because that party died in July 2016. It is now the Trump Party.

Who can forget that photo of Trump lobbing rolls of paper towels into the crowd as if he were tossing out MAGA hats at a campaign rally?

![President Trump Tossing Rolls of Paper Towels into Puerto Rican Crowd After a Hurricane.](https://ralphhightower.github.io/blog/img/241010-donald-trump-paper-towels-al-1022-242643.jpg)

The Trump administration would later stall $20 billion in hurricane relief for Puerto Rico, relief that Congress approved. In a closed-door meeting with Republicans, Trump also said federal funding was “way out of proportion to what Texas and Florida and others have gotten.” You see, in the mind of Trump, it’s not about who needs help; it’s about where victims of natural disasters live.

We recently learned that as president, Trump threatened to withhold federal aid to help California respond to dangerous wildfires. Former Trump administration official Olivia Troye told The New York Times that he viewed disaster relief as a matter of “red states vs. blue states.” Trump relented, the Times reports, after aides delivered voter data showing his supporters in Orange County were among those hit hardest. The Trump campaign denies that story is true.

Under Project 2025, Trump allies would push to outsource functions of the National Weather Service to private companies[^13]. Crucial weather information would be in the hands of the private sector instead of the federal government. The far-right.conservative blueprint would also abandon goals of fighting climate change by downsizing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Project 2025 calls the NOAA a leading driver of “the climate change alarm industry” and claims the agency is “harmful to future U.S. prosperity.”

[^13]: @RalphHightower – Privatization of [NOAA](https://noaa.gov/) is an extremely, decisionly, bad decision. NOAA operates the [GOES – Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites Network](https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/GOES/). All the data that NOAA produces is public information. It doesn't cost the public anything to access the information. With private weather companies, critical information may be withheld that endanger the public, or the information may be paid subscription only.

I wrote two blog posts where Trump altered a [National Hurricane Center](https://nhc.noaa.gov/) track to extend the "Cone of Uncertainty" into Alabama.

Now Trump is spreading lies and misinformation about recoveries in North Carolina and Florida. Both FEMA and North Carolina Department os Public Safety have pages dedicated to debunking the lies and misinformation that Trump is spewing about hurricanes recoveries. I could not find any information from Florida separating fact and fiction.

- [Hurricane Helene: Fact vs. Rumor / NC DPS](https://www.ncdps.gov/our-organization/emergency-management/hurricane-helene/hurricane-helene-fact-vs-rumor)

And then you have ***MEGA MAGA*** *Loonie Tunes* Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene saying whatever crazy conspiracy theory shit that pops into her vacant head.

@RalphHightower: Bless her heart[^21].

[^21]: [Bless your heart • Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bless_your_heart) – is a phrase common to the Southern United States. The phrase is used sometimes as an insult that conveys condescension, derision, or contempt.
