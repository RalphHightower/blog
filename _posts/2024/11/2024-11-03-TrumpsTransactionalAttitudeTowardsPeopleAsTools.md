## Trump's Transactional Attitude Of People As Tools

Everything Is a Transaction to Trump. Even Relationships

I questioned the mental acuity of South Carolina's Lieutenant Governor, Henry McMaster, when he endorsed Trump for president. Looking back on Trump selecting then South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley to be the US delegate to the United Nations, it makes perfect sense.

Trump: "Psst. Hey Henry, South Carolina is a early voting state and I could use a hugeliest  biggiliest, boost in your Republican primary. South Carolina is a beautiful state. You know that Obama is not American. He was born in Kenya. I own a resort in Florida. It's called Mar-a-Lago. Beautifullest golf course. I would play golf if South Carolina if I owned a golf resort here. I own a golf course in North Carolina. One of the biglyest,  bestest golf courses. Obama plays too much golf. I won't have time to play golf when I'm elected president. The PGA was going to hold a tournament there, but they canceled the tournament because of me. Can you believe that? I think I should sue the PGA. After I sue the PGA, then I'll buy it. I think that I'll buy Hilton Head. They have a bunch of golf courses. Where was I? Oh yea, I remember now. If you endose me for president, I'll make you governor of South Carolina. What do you think of this hugely idea?"[^712] McMaster: "You got yourself a deal!"

[^711]: Everything is a transaction for Trump. He *"buys"* people and disposes of them when they no longer are of value to him.
[^712]: *I tried stringing words together that don't make sense to mimic Trump’s unintelligible stream of meaningless words.* <br />I need to reset Android's spelling dictionary since Trump mangles  the English language by creating words that don't exist, adding 'ly', 'est', and 'liest', a combination of 'lt' and 'est', to words that it doesn't belong with.<br />— Ralph Hightower

### Trump's 2017 Appointments Made Clear During Trump's Third Presidential Run'

It all makes sense to me seeing Trump's promises of government positions to his backers and sycophants.

Elon Musk, fractional CEO and/or owner, of SpaceX, X/Twitter, Tesla, Starlink, Boring Co., while sugardaddy to Florida's governor, DeSantis as he was in the race, called Trump old, and needing to disappear into the sunset. Once DeSantis dropped out, Musk threw himself into Trump's welcoming arms. Correspondingly, Trump had a negative view of electric vehicles; now that he's getting Musk's money and support, he's warmed up to EVs.

Robert Kennedy Jr. mounted a futile third party run for president. Kennedy has some crazy, scientifically debunked views of science and medicine:

- Vaccines cause autism.

Now that RFKJr has dropped out and threw his supporters, meager as it was, to Trump. Trump is going to award him Department of Health.
