- **Health Debate**: There is ongoing debate about the health impacts of fluoride, with some studies suggesting potential risks at high exposure levels.
- **Legal Avenues**: The Trump administration could potentially use federal laws like the TSCA or the Safe Drinking Water Act to regulate or limit water fluoridation.
