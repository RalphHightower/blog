Viktor Orbán:

- "Just got off the phone with President Trump. I wished him the best of luck for next Tuesday. Only five days to go. Fingers crossed."
- “It was an honour to visit President Trump at [[Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/)](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) today. We discussed ways to make #peace. The good news of the day: he’s going to solve it!”

As a private citizen, Trump has continued a non-diplomatic relationship with Orbán, Trump has held several meetings with the nationalist leader, most recently at his [[Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/)](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) residence in July. Shortly after attending the NATO summit in Washington, Orbán made a stop in Florida to sit down with Trump, after which he posted a photo of them giving the camera a thumbs-up with the caption:

During Trump's debate with Harris in September, the former president, known for his admiration of dictators and authoritarian leaders, name-checked Orbán and called him a "tough person" and "smart." He then went on to explain that the feeling was mutual: “Look, Viktor Orbán said it. He said, ‘The most respected, the most feared person is Donald Trump. We had no problems when Trump was president,’” Trump said on stage.

Earlier this year, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell called out members of his party over what he described as a “cult of personality” around the ruler. “Hungary’s leaders have made no secret of their conviction that the future is one of American decline. Subservience to revanchist powers is not an American value. But far more importantly, it is not in America’s interests.”, McConnell said on the Senate floor.
