Story by Joe Sommerlad. November 4, 2024.

“You already know Donald Trump. He is unfit to lead. Watch him. Listen to those who know him best.”

“He tried to subvert an election and remains a threat to democracy. He helped overturn Roe, with terrible consequences.”

“Mr Trump’s corruption and lawlessness go beyond elections: It’s his whole ethos. He lies without limit[^31].”

[^31]: @RalphHightower: Trump is a pathological liar!

“If he’s re-elected, the GOP won’t restrain him[^41]. Mr Trump will use the government to go after opponents[^42]. He will pursue a cruel policy of mass deportations.”

[^41]: @RalphHightower: The Trumpers[^61] cower in fear of Trump.

[^42]: @RalphHightower: Trump has already declared that he will go after *"The Enemy Within"[^62].*

[^61]: @RalphHightower: It used to be called the Republican Party, but it died in 2016, when they chose an unqualified, unfit person as their candidate. It is now the Trump Party, and they are paying his legal bills.

[^61]: @RalphHightower: [I Am The Enemy Within – @RalphHightower / Ralph Hightower/Blog]({% link _posts/2024/10/2024-10-26-IAmTheEnemyWithin.md %})

“He will wreak havoc on the poor, the middle class and employers. Another Trump term will damage the climate, shatter alliances and strengthen autocrats. Americans should demand better. Vote[^51].”

[^51]: @RalphHightower: **Vote!** Our democracy, our nation is at stake.
