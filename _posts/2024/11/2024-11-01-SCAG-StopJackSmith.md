## [Attorney General Alan Wilson joins multistate effort against the federal government’s push to prosecute Trump following case dismissal - South Carolina Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/news/attorney-general-alan-wilson-joins-multistate-effort-against-the-federal-government-s-push-to-prosecute-trump-following-case-dismissal/)

NOV 01, 2024

(COLUMBIA, S.C.) - [Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/) [Alan Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general/) joined a [multistate effort](https://republicanags.com/) urging the [U.S. Court of Appeals](https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/court-role-and-structure/about-us-courts-appeals) for the [11th Circuit](https://www.uscourts.gov/federal-court-finder/location/276) to affirm the dismissal of [U.S. Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) [Special Counsel Jack Smith’s](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) [indictment](https://www.justice.gov/sco-smith/media/1366521/dl) of [former President Donald Trump](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/). The brief argues that [Smith’s actions](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) are invalid due to regulations that violate [Article II](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/article-2/) of the [U.S. Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/).

“Our argument is pretty simple—the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/) does not give the [U.S. Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/ag/bio/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland) the authority to give executive power to a special prosecutor like [Jack Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith),” said [Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/) [Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general/). “Therefore, his indictment against [Donald Trump](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/) should be dismissed.”

In 2022, [U.S. Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Merrick Garland](https://www.justice.gov/ag/bio/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland) appointed outside attorney [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) to serve as [Special Counsel](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) for the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/), investing [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) with the full power and independent authority to exercise the functions of any U.S. attorney to investigate [Trump](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/). [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) used that authority to take the unprecedented step of indicting a former President and the principal political rival of the current administration in power. However, unlike a U.S. Attorney, [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) faces next-to-zero presidential accountability.

The [coalition](https://republicanags.com/) filed an amicus brief to emphasize an alternative ground for affirmance of the district court’s judgment dismissing the indictment: “[Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) acted under regulations that authorize the exercise of core executive power unguided by the plenary control of the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) or any principal officer accountable to him. Because those regulations violate [Article II](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/article-2/) of the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/), [Smith’s](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) actions under them are invalid.”

The brief goes on to state: “Indeed, the avowed purpose of [Special Counsel](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) [Smith’s](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) appointment was to remove responsibility—and thus political accountability—for the investigations and prosecutions under his purview from the current [Administration](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/). The [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/ag/bio/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland) appointed [Special Counsel](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) after [President Trump](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/) announced his candidacy for the 2024 election because the [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) considered it ‘in the public interest’ for someone ‘independent’ of the Administration to head these criminal proceedings. The result: A single executive officer now unilaterally resolves massively consequential, politically fraught issues like whether to indict a [former president](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/) and current [presidential candidate](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/) and what position the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) will take as to whether and to what extent a [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) enjoys immunity from criminal prosecution. [Article II](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/article-2/) does not give the [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) the authority to vest the executive power in [Jack Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith)…The district court’s dismissal of the indictment should be affirmed.”

In addition to [South Carolina](https://www.scag.gov/), the following states joined the coalition: [Alabama](https://www.alabamaag.gov/), [Alaska](https://law.alaska.gov/), [Arkansas](https://arkansasag.gov/), [Florida](https://www.myflorida.com/), [Idaho](https://www.ag.idaho.gov/), [Indiana](https://www.in.gov/attorneygeneral/), [Iowa](https://www.iowaattorneygeneral.gov/), [Kansas](https://www.ag.ks.gov/), [Kentucky](https://ag.ky.gov/), [Louisiana](https://ag.louisiana.gov/), [Mississippi](https://www.ms.gov/Agencies/attorney-general), [Missouri](https://ago.mo.gov/), [Montana](https://dojmt.gov/), [Nebraska](https://ago.nebraska.gov/), [Oklahoma](https://oklahoma.gov/oag.html), [South Dakota](https://atg.sd.gov/#gsc.tab=0), [Tennessee](https://www.tn.gov/attorneygeneral.html), [Utah](https://attorneygeneral.utah.gov/), and [West Virginia](https://ago.wv.gov/).
