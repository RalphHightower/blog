## [What is Bluesky and why are millions of people joining it?](https://www.euronews.com/next/2024/11/18/what-is-bluesky-and-why-are-millions-of-people-joining-it?)

Story by Euronews. November 18, 2024.

- **[Bluesky's](https://bsky.app/) Growth**: [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/), a decentralized social media platform, has seen a significant increase in users, adding one million users in a day and reaching a total of 19 million users.
- **Platform Features**: [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) offers a Discover feed, a chronological feed, direct messaging, and video sharing. It is built on the AT Protocol, promoting independence for creators and freedom for developers.
- **Shift from [X](https://x.com/)**: Many users, including academics, journalists, and celebrities, are moving from [X (formerly Twitter)](https://x.com/) to [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/), partly due to changes made by [Elon Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk) and his support for [Donald Trump.](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump)
- **Global Impact**: [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) has previously seen user increases, such as after [X](https://x.com/) was banned in Brazil, highlighting its growing global presence.

@RalphHightower: [X/Twitter](https://x.com) has become a cesspool of bigotry and hate speech. Companies have pulled their  advertising dollars from [X/Twitter](https:// x.com/) to protect their brand name.

[Elon Musk](https://x.com/elonmush) claims to be a proponent of free speech. However, once Florida's governor Ron DeSantis dropped out of the 2024 presidential race, [Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk) hitched his wagon to [Trump](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump) and turned [X/Twitter](https://x.com/) into a [Trump Propaganda Machine](https://.com/realdonaldtrump), spreading misinformation, and conspiracy theories against the Democrats in the 2024 election. 

As of April 27, 2023, I deactivated my [Twitter](https:x.com/) account based on this [Elon Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk) tweet:<br />[@ElonMusk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1651602599345373186): *Anyone making materially false statements on this platform will get Community Noted, including you, me, Tucker, advertisers, head of state, etc. No exceptions. <br />Convince the people and let the chips fall where they may.* <br />@RalphHightower: Seriously? Yet you welcomed back a pathological liar, [Donald Trump](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump), who incited and welcomed violence in an attempted coup d'état on January 6 in the storming of the U.S. Capitol. [Twitter](https://x.com/) has gone to ***HELL!***

Millions of users have joined the social media platform [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) in the wake of the US presidential election.

Several academics, journalists, left-leaning politicians, and celebrities have said they would join the platform that used to be backed by former [Twitter](https://x.com) CEO Jack Dorsey.

The platform said over the weekend that it was adding one million users in a day, with its total number of users now at 19 million.

### What is [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/)?

[Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) is a decentralised social media platform that was founded as a research initiative as part of [Twitter](https://x.com/) in 2019.

In 2021, Jay Graber became CEO of the platform, with Dorsey leaving the platform's board in May. The site was initially invitation-only but opened to the public in February.

It contains both a Discover feed, which [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) said last year is "customised for what you like to see, while still giving you a view into what’s trending in the network". It also has a chronological feed for accounts that users follow.

### New members as some flee X

The uptick for [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) comes as several [X (formerly Twitter)](https://X com/) users have said they're leaving the platform.

[Elon Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk) acquired the platform in 2022 and made several changes to how it moderates content, for instance.

[He](https://x.com/elonmusk) was also a vocal supporter of US President-elect [Donald Trump](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump) during the 2024 US presidential election, posting about the vote extensively on [X.](https://X com/)

A report from the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) ahead of the election found that [Musk's](https://x.com/elonmusk) false or misleading claims on the platform had gathered nearly two billion views.

The [billionaire](https://x.com/elonmusk) has now been tapped by [Trump](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump) to form a new government efficiency office.

Newspapers such as The Guardian in the UK and La Vanguardia in Spain announced after the US presidential election that they would leave [Musk's](https://x.com/elonmusk) platform, with The Guardian saying it was due to "the often disturbing content promoted or found on the platform".

Other users on [X](https://x.com/) said that they would not leave the platform but rather were adding accounts on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) as millions joined its competitor.

Former Human Rights Watch director Kenneth Roth, meanwhile, posted that it's "a mistake for progressives to leave [X](https://x.com)".

"Yes it has taken a rightward and toxic turn under [Elon Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk), but there is no place comparable for discussion of the world's most important developments. Fleeing [X](https://x.com/) abandons this influential forum to the far right," he wrote.

### Previous uptick in [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) users

The post-election uptick in users isn’t the first time [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) has benefited from people leaving [X.](https://X com/)

The platform gained 2.6 million users in the week after [X](https://x.com/)was banned in Brazil in August with 85 per cent of them from Brazil, the company said.

About 500,000 new users signed up in one day in October when [X](https://x.com/)signalled that blocked accounts would be able to see a user’s public posts.

Despite [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/)’s growth, [X](https://x.com/) posted after the election that it had “dominated the global conversation on the US election” and had set new records.
