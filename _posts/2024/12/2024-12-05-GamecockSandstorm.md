Psalm 23 🕊️
This video and every other video depicting a South Carolina football game is dedicated to a dear friend of mine from high school and her family. On August 15, just about two weeks before the season got underway, her father very unexpectedly passed away while at work. He was a huge Carolina fan, and by all accounts a great person and loved by all who had the pleasure of knowing him. May he rest in peace, and my continued thoughts and prayers are with you all. 🙏🙏🙏

~~~

Welcome to the fifteenth episode of Double Beat 2023!

The stars are out in Columbia this weekend! Darude himself—Finnish DJ and producer, the composer of “Sandstorm,” and the “Mozart of Columbia”—is in town to perform his hit single LIVE! Released in 1999, Sandstorm became the anthem of Gamecock Football in 2009 when it was played in the Thursday night upset victory over #4 Ole Miss. Sandstorm has continued to evolve in its presentation at USC games with the introduction of the remix and the garnet lighting, so it only seems fitting that Darude himself is now in Williams-Brice for the first time and surely not his last.

Additionally, it’s South Carolina vs. Kentucky, Shane Beamer vs. Mark Stoops, senior night for the Carolina Band, and the football game debut of the Secret show featuring Tom Cruise, Austin Powers, and James Bond. It’s Saturday Night in the SEC—what more could you ask for?
