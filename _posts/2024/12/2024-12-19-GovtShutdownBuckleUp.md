President-elect Trump excoriated a bipartisan government funding bill Wednesday afternoon, throwing the stopgap measure into chaos just as leaders of both parties were hoping to pass it. The joint statement by Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance left Republican leaders scrambling to come up with a new plan in the House, where Trump wields significant influence. The Morning Joe panel discusses.

STAY THE SPEAKER NOMINEE?
>> JOHNSON IS GOING TO BE THE
SPEAKER.
HE'S NOT GOING TO GET HIM
THROUGH WITH JUST THE
REPUBLICANS.
HE NEEDS DEMOCRATS TO SUPPORT
HIM OR HE'LL NEVER MAKE SPEAKER.
HE JUST IS NOT GOING TO.
>> EXTRAORDINARY DEVELOPMENTS ON
CAPITOL HILL.
DEMOCRATS POINTING FINGERS AT
REPUBLICANS.
REPUBLICANS BLAMING SPEAKER MIKE
JOHNSON.
ALL WHILE DONALD TRUMP AND ELON
MUSK PUSH CONGRESS TOWARD A
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN, ORDERING
REPUBLICANS YESTERDAY NOT TO
SUPPORT THE BIPARTISAN SPENDING
DEAL.
GOOD MORNING.
WELCOME TO "MORNING JOE."
IT IS THURSDAY, DECEMBER 10th.
I'M WILLIE GEIST.
JOE AND MIKA HAVE THE MORNING
OFF.
WITH US, THE HOST OF "WAY TOO
EARLY" FOR ONE MORE DAY,

ALSO, MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR MIKE
BARNICLE.
THE HOST OF MSNBC'S "INSIDE WITH
JEN PSAKI," JEN PSAKI.
AND FORMER TREASURY OFFICIAL AND
"MORNING JOE" ECONOMIC ANALYST,
STEVE RATTNER.
LET'S SET UP WHAT HAPPENED
YESTERDAY.
A BIPARTISAN PLAN TO FUND THE
GOVERNMENT AND AVOID A SHUTDOWN
FELL APART YESTERDAY AFTER
PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP AND ELON
MUSK VOICED THEIR OPPOSITION TO
THE BILL.
DESPITE HAVING THE STAMP OF
APPROVAL FROM CONGRESSIONAL
LEADERSHIP, TRUMP AND VICE
PRESIDENT-ELECT JD VANCE
CONDEMNED THE BILL.
ALSO, DEMANDING THE LEGISLATION
INCLUDE A DEBT CEILING INCREASE.
WRITING IN PART, "INCREASING THE
DEBT CEILING IS NOT GREAT, BUT
WE'D RATHER DO IT ON BIDEN'S
WATCH.
WE SHOULD PASS A STREAMLINE
SPENDING BILL THAT DOESN'T GIVE
CHUCK SCHUMER AND THE DEMOCRATS
EVERYTHING THEY WANT."
THAT CAME AFTER MUSK SPENT HOURS
