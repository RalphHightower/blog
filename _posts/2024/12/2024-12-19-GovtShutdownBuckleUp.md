excerpt: ''A bipartisan plan to fund the government and avoid a shutdown fell apart yesterday after president-elect Trump and Elon Musk voiced theiropposition to the bill. Despite having the stamp of approval from congressional leadership, Trump and vice president-elect JD Vance condemned the bill. Also, demanding the legislation include a debt ceiling increase. Writing in part, “Increasing the debt ceiling is not great, but we'd rather do it on Biden's watch. We should pass a streamline spending bill that doesn't give Chuck Schumer and the Democrats everything they want.”"
