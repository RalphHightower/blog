## Downsides of Being President

I can not fathom why Trump wanted to be president and wanted four more years. 

Trump has such a fragile ego and sense of self-worth that I don't know why he would subject himself to open and harsh criticism. Just look at the shit that spewed out of his mouth that was directed towards President Obama. 

Presidents live under a microscope. Every action or inaction will be either be praised or criticized. Seldom will there be unanimous praise or criticism[^11].

[^11]: @RalphHightower: Although in the Trump cult, their leader can do no wrong. 

Trump has no respect for the military who were captured or died while serving their country. He calls those military, "losers."

Trump is not a true leader. He thinks that "leadership" is through fear and intimidation. That is what he experienced and embraced when his parents sent him to the New York Military School. NYMS is a private school that parents send their incorrigible brats to learn discipline along with high school level education. 

The United States operates several military academies where graduates go on to serve in that branch of service. 

- United States Military Academy, West Point, New York
- United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland
- United States Air Force Academy, Colorado Springs, Colorado
- United States Coast Guard Academy, New London, Connecticut
- United States Merchant Marine Academy, Kings Point, New York

Trump is a "glory hog". He steals credit from others when things go right.

At the opposite end of the spectrum, Trump is a "blame-shifter". He blames others for his failures.

**Servant leadership** is a leadership philosophy built on the belief that the most effective leaders strive to serve others, rather than accrue power or take control. 

From July 2007 through June 2008, I served as one of the six Division Governors for [South Carolina Toastmasters District 58](https://www.toastmasters-d58.org/) of [Toastmasters International](https://www.toastmasters.org/). Division C supported six areas that covered a swath of South Carolina from Rock Hill to North Augusta and Edgefield.
