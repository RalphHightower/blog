excerpt: "This is the first scandal of a second Trump term, and take a long look at it because it's going to look like all the other scandals. This is going to be the theme of the next four years. Personal business interests are going to take precedence over governance in the Trump/Musk White House. The word for this is oligarchy because oligarchs don't think about the country first. We are starting the holidays in the midst of a presidential transition that really has been a sham bollic mess and it should be covered as such. But on top of all of those mistakes, we are now seeing the first signs that the errors and the own goals and the self-inflicted humiliations of this nascent presidency. They may reflect a new president who is not just incompetent, who is not just bad at the basics of what it takes to appoint people to jobs and run a transition, we may be seeing the first signs of a new president who is weak enough not just to fail, but to be taken advantage of by the brighter bulbs on the tree."

Donald Trump's transition ahead of his second term in office was already a series of humiliations and failures as his inability to pick qualified members of his administration was laid bare, but the spending bill debacle showed that in addition to that incompetence, Trump is vulnerable to being taken advantage of, as Elon Musk did with apparent ease.
