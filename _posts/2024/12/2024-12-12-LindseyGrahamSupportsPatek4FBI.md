excerpt: "Turning to Patel. He is trumps pick to head the FBI. He was back on the hill yesterday for a second straight day of meetings. The meet with key republican senators Thom Tillis, Lindsey Graham and Mike Lee. All three have signaled they will support Patel’s nomination. Senator Graham posted this photo on social media after the meeting, endorsing Patel's nomination. Writing, he promised to get the FBI back on its original mission of protecting America. And with the days of the FBI leadership having their finger on the scale politically will be over. Was he going to arrest members of the press? Nothing. Because they didn't support the stop the still conspiracy theory. And put the shoe on the other foot. Can you imagine if Joe Biden biden, Barack Obama or someone else had nominated someone who said, we are going to arrest members of the media at Fox News or Newsmax over Democrats. Please pick locusts descending from the sky. We know exactly what happened."
