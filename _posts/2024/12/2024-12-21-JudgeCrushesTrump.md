[Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s legal troubles just got worse as a New York judge rejected his attempt to toss out his 34 felony convictions in the hush money election interference case. Despite being found guilty months ago, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) still hasn’t been sentenced, and his latest tantrum—complete with attacks on the judge and baseless lawsuits against critics—proves he’s out for revenge.

In this episode, Mary breaks down [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s unhinged legal strategy, his escalating attacks on journalists, and his absurd push to investigate [Liz Cheney (R-WY)](https://www.congress.gov/member/liz-cheney/C001109) for holding him accountable. Plus, why [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s retaliation tactics are designed to intimidate—and how we can fight back.
