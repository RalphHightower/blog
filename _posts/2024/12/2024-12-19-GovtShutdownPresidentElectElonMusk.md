excerpt: "It's shameful, and I think this idea that we're going to play with people's lives, particularly during the holidays, let's be very clear, that people don't get paid are military, are folks that are depending at our va hospitals, people working at our nation's airports would not be receiving pay during a shutdown. The people we depend to help seniors with social security, with medicare, those folks would not be receiving a paycheck, and so this is actually very serious for working class americans across the country, and this idea that elon musk, the richest man in the world could care less about people and harming folks because he wants to take more of their hard-earned money, is shameful. It's dangerous. You should fight against itevery single day here in congress."
