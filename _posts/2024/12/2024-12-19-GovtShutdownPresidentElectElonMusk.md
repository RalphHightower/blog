A government shutdown is nearing after President-elect Trump and Elon Musk railed against a funding bill. Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., criticizes Trump and Musk for breaking the deal and discusses the consequences of the move.

>>> LET'S BRING IN ROBERT GARCIA
OF CALIFORNIA NOW.
CONGRESSMAN, THANKS FOR JOINING
US.
FROM YOUR VIEW, WHERE DO THINGS
STAND?
CAN THIS CONGRESS GET ITS ACT
TOGETHER BEFORE TOMORROW NIGHT?
>> WELL, FIRST, WELCOME TO THE
ELON MUSK PRESIDENCY, ONE WHERE
DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN RELEGATED
TO BE THE VICE PRESIDENT.
CLEARLY WHAT ELON MUSK WANTS,
ELON MUSK IS GOING TO GET, AND
WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW IS
COMPLETE CHAOS ON THE REPUBLICAN
SIDE.
WE HAVE A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN
THAT IS LOOMING, THAT IS REAL
RIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS, AND WE
SHOULD BE REALLY CLEAR.
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS
NOT PAYING OUR MILITARY MEMBERS
DURING THE HOLIDAYS, NOT PAYING
OUR TSA WORKERS DURING THE
HOLIDAYS, NOT PAYING THE PEOPLE
THAT ARE WORKING ON ALL OF OUR
HOLIDAY TRAVEL THAT ARE OUT
THERE WORKING FOR US EVERY
SINGLE DAY.
SO THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY SERIOUS
MOMENT.
IT'S ONE WHERE SPEAKER JOHNSON
HAS LOST COMPLETE CONTROL, AND
CLEARLY WHERE ELON MUSK IS
PULLING THE STRINGS OF WHAT
REPUBLICANS SHOULD BE DOING.
SO IT'S QUITE CHAOTIC, BUT
DEMOCRATS ARE UNITED.
WE HAD A BIPARTISAN DEAL
NEGOTIATED, AND HAVE COMPLETELY
GONE AND TURNED THEIR BACKS ON
IT.
>> YOU JUST GOT OUT OF THIS
HOUSE DEMOCRATS MEETING.
WE SAW LEADER JEFFRIES' COMMENTS
YESTERDAY.
IF THERE'S A SHUTDOWN, EVERYONE
LOSES.
SO WHAT DO YOU SEE AS YOUR
PARTY'S ROLE RIGHT NOW?
>> WELL, FIRST, THERE'S NOTHING
NOW RIGHT NOW ON THE TABLE, AND
SO REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO HAVE
TO DECIDE WHAT THEY BRING
FORWARD, BUT WE DON'T EXPECT
ANYTHING TO HAPPEN HERE IN THE
NEXT FEW HOURS.
WE THINK THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY
NEGOTIATING RIGHT NOW.
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR OUR
LEADERSHIP TO CONTINUE MEETINGS
WITHIN OUR OWN CAUCUS, BUT WHAT
WE'RE CLEAR ON IS WE DO NOT WANT
THE GOVERNMENT TO SHUT DOWN, AND
WE HAD A DEAL IN PLACE, AND
LET'S THINK ABOUT THIS.
THE DEAL THAT WAS IN FRONT OF
THE CONGRESS HAD $100 BILLION
FOR DISASTER RELIEF FOR STATES
ACROSS THE COUNTRY LIKE NORTH
CAROLINA, LIKE FLORIDA, LIKE
CALIFORNIA.
IT WAS NECESSARY AND NEEDED TO
GET HELP TO THE PEOPLE ON THE
GROUND, AND REPUBLICANS HAVE NOW
TURNED THEIR BACK ON DISASTER
RELIEF, AND ON SUPPORTING
FARMERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
ON TOP OF THAT, YOU HAVE 85% OF
THE FEDERAL WORK FORCE BY THE
WAY, WHO WORKED OUTSIDE OF
WASHINGTON, D.C.
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WERE
DEPENDING ON SERVICES.
NOW IN REALLY A DIRE SITUATION
RIGHT BEFORE THE HOLIDAYS WITH
THE SHUT
THE SHUTDOWN LOOMING AND THEY
NEED TO GET THIS IN FRONT OF THE
CONGRESS.
WHAT THAT'S GOING TO BE, WE'RE
NOT SURE, BUT ELON MUSK IS
PULLING THE STRINGS.
>> WE HEARD WHAT TRUMP TOLD NBC
NEWS ABOUT THIS, SAYING
DEMOCRATS WANT TO GET RID OF THE
DEBT CEILING.
THAT'S WHAT HE'S ADVOCATING IS
INCLUDED IN THIS LEGISLATION.
WOULD DEMOCRATS TEAM UP WITH
TRUMP TO GET RID OF THE DEBT
CEING ONCE AND FOR ALL?
>> LOOK.
I THINK A LOT OF DEMOCRATS ARE
HAPPY TO HAVE A DEBATE ABOUT THE
DEBT CEILING, BUT LET'S BE
CRYSTAL CLEAR WHY DONALD TRUMP
WANTS TO ACTUALLY ELIMINATE THE
DEBT CEILING.
HE WANTS TO HAVE THE UNLIMITED
ABILITY TO TAKE ALL OF THIS
COUNTRY'S WEALTH, FOUGHT AND
EARNED BY MIDDLE CLASS AND
WORKING CLASS AMERICANS AND
REDISTRIBUTE ALL THAT MONEY TO
THE TOP 1% TO BILLIONAIRES AND
THE COMPANIES THAT THEY OWN, AND
GIVING TAX CUTS TO THE VERY
RICH.
THAT'S WHY DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO
ELIMINATE THE DEBT CEILING,
BECAUSE HE WANTS TO ESSENTIALLY
TAKE ALL THIS WEALTH AND GIVE IT
TO THE VERY RICH AND HIS RICHEST
FRIENDS.
SO LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT WHY
DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO HAVE THAT
DEBATE.
>> YOU MENTIONED THIS IS THE
ELON MUSK PRESIDENCY.
YOUR WORDS.
MUSK AND OTHERS ARE CALLING FOR
A SHUTDOWN AFTER TRUMP'S
INAUGURATION.
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT?
>> IT'S SHAMEFUL, AND I THINK
THIS IDEA THAT WE'RE GOING TO
PLAY WITH PEOPLE'S LIVES,
PARTICULARLY DURING THE
HOLIDAYS, LET'S BE VERY CLEAR,
THAT PEOPLE DON'T GET PAID ARE
MILITARY, ARE FOLKS THAT ARE
DEPENDING AT OUR VA HOSPITALS,
PEOPLE WORKING AT OUR NATION'S
AIRPORTS WOULD NOT BE RECEIVING
PAY DURING A SHUTDOWN.
THE PEOPLE WE DEPEND TO HELP
SENIORS WITH SOCIAL SECURITY,
WITH MEDICARE, THOSE FOLKS WOULD
NOT BE RECEIVING A PAYCHECK, AND
SO THIS IS ACTUALLY VERY SERIOUS
FOR WORKING CLASS AMERICANS
ACROSS THE COUNTRY, AND THIS
IDEA THAT ELON MUSK, THE RICHEST
MAN IN THE WORLD COULD CARE LESS
ABOUT PEOPLE AND HARMING FOLKS
BECAUSE HE WANTS TO TAKE MORE OF
THEIR HARD-EARNED MONEY, IS
SHAMEFUL.
IT'S DANGEROUS.
YOU SHOULD FIGHT AGAINST IT
EVERY SINGLE DAY HERE IN
CONGRESS.
