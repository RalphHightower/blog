## Marjorie Taylor Greene (T-GA14) Says Government 'In Control' of New Jersey Drones - Newsweek

Published Dec 15, 2024 at 7:52 AM EST. Updated Dec 16, 2024 at 10:16 AM EST

Trumper Representative [Marjorie Taylor Greene (T-GA14)](https://greene.house.gov/) has accused the government of withholding information about the mysterious drones that have been sighted over New Jersey and New York.

Despite the FBI receiving thousands of reports from the public since the sightings began in November, a spokesperson for the bureau, told Congress on Tuesday "we don't know" who is behind them, even though multiple drones have been sighted flying near sensitive military sites.

On Saturday, an airport in New York was shut down for an hour after drone activity blocked its airspace.

In a Saturday post on X, [Greene (T-GA14)](https://greene.house.gov/) said she did not believe the official communications from the government.

"The government is in control of the drones and refuses to tell the American people what is going on. It really is that bad," she wrote.

In a Friday interview with the Daily Mail, [Greene (T-GA14)](https://greene.house.gov/) said the government was withholding information about the drones.

"I'm gonna call it total bullsit that no one knows what these are. And I think it's a slap in the face to the American people to say they don't know what this is." [Greene (T-GA14)](https://greene.house.gov/) said.

Around 5,000 reports have been received via a national tip line established due to widespread calls for answers from civilians and local authorities, an FBI official told reporters on the Saturday press call. Of these tips, however, the official said that "less than 100 leads have been generated and deemed worthy of further investigative activity."

Newsweek previously spoke to drone expert Vijay Kumar, a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Pennsylvania.

He was skeptical of rumors that the drones were being sent by a foreign state actor, and suggested the evidence pointed toward it being a U.S. government operation.

Kumar said that even though the FBI said it does not know who is behind the drones, it does not mean the U.S. government as a whole is not involved, especially given that the drones have been sighted near airports and military bases, which are equipped with sophisticated radar.

"There's a lot of firewalling between agencies, so the fact that FBI says they don't know what's happening, that's very likely too, but I find it really hard to believe, as somebody who's lived in this country for 40 years, that the U.S. government doesn't know exactly what is going on."

@RalphHightower: [@MTG](https://greene.house.gov/) is a first-class nut job. Earlier this year, she claimed that 'The Government' controls hurricanes. **Girl!** You are *The Government!*
