## [Donald Trump Wants Liz Cheney Pardoned / Opinion](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-wants-liz-cheney-pardoned-opinion-2003709)

Story by Ross Rosenfeld. December 20, 2024.

- **Trump's Strategy**: Donald Trump suggested that Liz Cheney could be prosecuted for her role in investigating the January 6 attack, but he might actually want her pardoned to avoid relitigating the insurrection.
- **Political Implications**: Prosecuting Cheney could backfire on Trump, making her a hero and bringing renewed focus to his actions during the January 6 events.
- **Legal Hurdles**: The Constitution's speech or debate clause provides members of Congress with immunity for acts performed on the floor, complicating any prosecution.
- **Pardon Considerations**: President Joe Biden might consider offering preemptive pardons to those under threat from Trump's potential actions, though some may prefer to fight the accusations.
