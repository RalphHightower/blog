The votes are in: Donald Trump has clinched the 2024 election. And now, the world braces for what’s next. Washington insiders Jen Rubin — Washington Post columnist and host of the sharp-as-a-tack Politicon podcast — and George Conway, celebrated legal mind and relentless Trump critic, step into the ring to decode the seismic tremors of Trump’s victory.

[^11]: [Kakistocracy • Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakistocracy?wprov=sfla1): A kakistocracy (/kækɪˈstɒkrəsi/, /kækɪsˈtɒ-/) is a government run by the worst, least qualified, or most unscrupulous citizens.  The word was coined as early as the seventeenth century.
