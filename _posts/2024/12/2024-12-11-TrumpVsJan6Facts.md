While Donald Trump continues to insist that people convicted and jailed for their participation in the January 6 insurrection are actually hostages, and the congressional committee that investigated January 6, including Trump's role in instigating it somehow committed a crime, the fact remains that even if everyone in America didn't have a first-hand memory of the violence that day, there is copious, on the record evidence, including seemingly endless amounts of video exposing Trump's lie about that day. Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a member of the January 6 Committee joins Rachel Maddow to discuss. 

@RalphHightower: Trump is not a Law and Order president. The only times when Trump is for the law is when it favors him.
