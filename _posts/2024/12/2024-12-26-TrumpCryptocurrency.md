Charlie Warzel, staff writer for the Atlantic, talks with Alex Wagner about the relationship between the MAGA movement and the cryptocurrency community, and why cryptocurrency would be particularly appealing to Trump.

@RalphHightower: Some Trumpers want to establish a cryptocurrency reserve. Crypto is not backed by anything. It’s primarily used by criminals to hide their money trail. Buying cryptocurrency yearly rewards those that own crypto. Criminals will be eager to break into Fort Knox to steal cryptocurrency. No armored van is necessary for the theft.
