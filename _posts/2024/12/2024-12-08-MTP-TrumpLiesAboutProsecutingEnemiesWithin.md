President-elect Donald Trump says he will not direct Pam Bondi or Kash Patel to go after President Joe Biden or Jack Smith, but it’s their decision.

@@RalphHightower: Trump is such a pathological liar that he thinks Biden weaponized the justice system against him. If you read the Federal government's supercedes indictment against Trump, the citizen and not acting as president, the indictment is rock solid! During Trump's 2024 campaign he promised to weaponize the justice system and that he would be the president of retribution. Trump has not been visited by the &Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come[^11].*
