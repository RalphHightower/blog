@RalphHightower: Before the article about [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s and [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)'s plan to turn [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/), watch [Neil deGrasse Tyson](https://neildegrassetyson.com/)'s video asking the question, "Has [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/) Done Anything [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) Hasn't?"

[SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/) will only do things that make money. Yeah, he plans to launch people to [Mars](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/mars-2020-perseverance/). But how is he going to pay for it? The research? The development? The testing?

Nobody thought about sending men to the moon until president [John F Kennedy](https://www.jfklibrary.org/learn/about-jfk/life-of-john-f-kennedy) gave his famous ["We will go to the moon speech"](https://www.jfklibrary.org/asset-viewer/archives/usg-15-29-2) at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/). At the time, but [Russia](http://government.ru/) had shocked America by launching Sputnik. We were behind. Both nations had nuclear missiles pointed at each other.

Would [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) develop the [James Webb Space Telescope](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/webb/)? No. There's no money in the venture.

[Voyager](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/voyager/)? Still exploring using 1969's technology. No.

[Parker Solar Probe](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/parker-solar-probe/)?

## Has [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/) Done Anything [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) Hasn't?

Oct 24, 2024 [Neil deGrasse Tyson](https://neildegrassetyson.com/) Explains...
Does [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/) have a role in furthering the frontier of space exploration? [Neil deGrasse Tyson](https://neildegrassetyson.com/) addresses comments on [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/)’s trip to [Mars](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/mars-2020-perseverance/), the role of public versus private enterprise in space exploration, and whether companies can afford to take the risks needed in space travel.

[Neil deGrasse Tyson](https://neildegrassetyson.com/): "Civilization has in essentially every case been led geopolitically by Nations. Nations lead expensive projects and when the cost of these projects are understood the risks are Quantified and the time frames are established then private Enterprise comes in later to see if they can make a buck off of it."

Here are the key points from the article:

- **[NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/)'s Future**: President-elect [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and Elon [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)'s plans could turn [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) into a contracting agency, heavily reliant on [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/).
- **[Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) Action**: [Congressional](https://www.congress.gov/) can protect [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) by mandating dual-source contracting and safeguarding the Space Launch System ([SLS](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/space-launch-system/)).
- **[SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/) Concerns**: [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/) is behind schedule on key projects, raising doubts about its ability to handle more ambitious missions.
- **Protecting [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/)**: [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) should ensure [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/)'s independence and prevent [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) from influencing its operations.

If President-elect Donald [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and Elon [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) get their way, [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) may become a glorified contracting agency.
As [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) promises the American public “temporary hardship” as he looks to cut some \$2 trillion from the federal budget — the equivalent of all spending outside Social Security, Medicare and interest on the national debt — [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s top space advisers talk openly about funneling even more public money to [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)’s [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/). If actually implemented, such proposals would give [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) a de facto monopoly over America’s commercial space industry, stifle healthy competition that fuels technological innovation and demoralize an already overtaxed [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) workforce.

Never mind that [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/) remains well behind schedule when it comes to delivering a lunar lander derived from its [Starship vehicle](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/starship/), or that it’ll need an as-yet untried on-orbit refueling method to reach the moon.

This reality makes it ludicrous to suggest, as [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) space adviser [Greg Autry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregwautry/) has done, that [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) simply contract out a human Mars mission to [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/). To put it bluntly, the company has not demonstrated the technical competence required to execute even less demanding missions.

[NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) remains an irreplaceable and indispensable public agency. If [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) hollow it out, however, the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) will quickly find itself without any viable space program.

Fortunately, [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) can prevent the incoming administration from dismantling [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) and effectively turning its activities over to one private company. Indeed, [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) has historically proven more than willing to exert its authority when it comes to America’s space exploration priorities — and it should do so once again to protect [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) and ensure robust competition in America’s commercial space industry.

First, [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) can legally protect the [Space Launch System](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/space-launch-system/) — the only rocket able to send astronauts to the moon in one launch — from an executive branch firing squad. As it has done with specific types of military aircraft, [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) could prohibit [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) from stopping work on [SLS](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/space-launch-system/) or canceling already-signed contracts for future [SLS](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/space-launch-system/) rockets. [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) could also mandate [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) use [SLS](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/space-launch-system/) and the [Orion](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/orion-spacecraft/) crew vehicle for [Artemis](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/artemis/) missions to the moon as well as on other agency missions, when applicable.

For all the compromises involved in its creation and design, [SLS](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/space-launch-system/) remains a unique capability that no other nation or private company can match — and one that has already proven itself.

Next, [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) can require [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) to contract with more than one company when it procures commercial space services. Such a move would preserve competition in the commercial space industry and preempt any attempt by [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) to entrench [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/) as a de facto monopoly for commercial space services. Without real competition, innovation and quality control — vital in an enterprise as inherently dangerous as human spaceflight — will inevitably suffer.

Such dual-source contracting is already a best practice for [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/). Contracts for commercial cargo and crew missions to the [International Space Station](https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/), for instance, have typically involved at least two companies. When funding concerns led the agency to award [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/) and [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/) alone a contract to build a lunar lander for [Artemis](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/artemis/), [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) stepped in to require [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) to choose a second company to build a separate lunar lander. In May 2023, [Blue Origin](https://www.blueorigin.com/) was given a \$3.4 billion contract to build [Blue Moon](https://www.blueorigin.com/blue-moon).

To prevent the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) administration from simply giving handouts to [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/), [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) should write this dual-source commercial contracting policy into law. Details will remain up to lawmakers, of course, but [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) should mandate that [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) award major commercial services contracts — cargo delivery to the [ISS](https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/) and its successors, commercial crew transportation to low-Earth orbit and human and robotic lunar landing services, to name a few — to at least two companies. That will require additional resources so [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) can fund two commercial services contracts at once.

Finally, [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) should do whatever it can to shield [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) and its workforce from the ministrations of the so-called “government efficiency” effort co-chaired by [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk). It could use annual agency authorization and appropriations laws to legally require [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) to recuse himself from any role with any agency with which his companies have contracts or outstanding regulatory disputes. If [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) plays hardball right out of the gate, [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) could explicitly exempt [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) from the ambit of his committee’s work.

Likewise, [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) could also refuse to confirm any nominee for [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) administrator unwilling to support the agency’s existing plans and programs, especially its human spaceflight endeavors.

There are likely other ways [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) could protect [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/), of course, but it would be a tragedy of the highest order if [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) allowed the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) administration to gut the agency. It’s not that [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) is perfect; indeed, it could stand to do business better and spend its money more wisely. But for all its flaws and faults, the agency remains one of the nation’s most precious assets — one that expands humanity’s knowledge of the cosmos and inspires us to look beyond our present circumstances.

| Federal Agency | Functions |
|---|---|
| [National Aeronautics and Space Administration](https://www.nasa.gov/) | The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) explores space, and researches Earth systems, the solar system, and the universe. |
| [Voyager - NASA Science](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/voyager/) | Voyager 1 and its twin Voyager 2 are the only spacecraft ever to operate outside the heliosphere, the protective bubble of particles and magnetic fields generated by the Sun. Voyager 1 reached the interstellar boundary in 2012, while Voyager 2 (traveling slower and in a different direction than its twin) reached it in 2018. |
| [James Webb Space Telescope - NASA Science](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/webb/) | Webb studies every phase in the history of our Universe, ranging from the first luminous glows after the Big Bang, to the formation of solar systems capable of supporting life on planets like Earth, to the evolution of our own Solar System. Webb launched on Dec. 25th 2021. It does not orbit around the Earth like the Hubble Space Telescope, it orbits the Sun 1.5 million kilometers (1 million miles) away from the Earth at what is called the second Lagrange point or L2.  |
| [Parker Solar Probe - NASA Science](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/parker-solar-probe/) | On a mission to “touch the Sun,” NASA's Parker Solar Probe became the first spacecraft to fly through the corona – the Sun’s upper atmosphere – in 2021. With every orbit bringing it closer, the probe faces brutal heat and radiation to provide humanity with unprecedented observations, visiting the only star we can study up close. |
| [Mars 2020: Perseverance Rover - NASA Science](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/mars-2020-perseverance/) | The Mars 2020 Perseverance Rover searches for signs of ancient microbial life, to advance NASA's quest to explore the past habitability of Mars. The rover is collecting core samples of Martian rock and regolith (broken rock and soil), for potential pickup by a future mission that would bring them to Earth for detailed study. |
| [Rice University, 12 September 1962 / JFK Library](https://www.jfklibrary.org/asset-viewer/archives/usg-15-29-2) | Video of the National Aeronautic Space Administration's (NASA) coverage of President John F. Kennedy’s address at Rice University, Houston, Texas, concerning the nation's efforts in space exploration. In his speech the President discusses the necessity for the United States to become an international leader in space exploration and famously states, "We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard." |
| [International Space Station - NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/) | The station was designed between 1984 and 1993. Elements of the station were in construction throughout the US, Canada, Japan, and Europe beginning in the late 1980s.<br /><br />The International Space Station Program brings together international flight crews, multiple launch vehicles, globally distributed launch and flight operations, training, engineering, and development facilities, communications networks, and the international scientific research community. |
