## ['Not exactly a statement you want to have to make': Jen Psaki points to Trump problem](https://www.rawstory.com/trump-problem-elon/)

Story by Tom Boggioni. December 22, 2024.

Sunday, former White House press secretary Jen Psaki claimed a statement from Donald Trump's incoming press secretary that her boss is "the Leader of the Republican Party. Full stop," is a bad sign for the president-elect.

The chaos, drama, and political brinksmanship raised questions of who is really in control.

- President-elect Elon Musk?[^11]
- President-elect Donald Trump

[^11]: @RalphHightower: The Constitution prohibits naturalized citizens from serving as president.

On her MSNBC show, she shared clips of Democrats using "President Musk" as a way to get under the president-elect's skin.

“Musk felt the need to go back on X and say it was, quote, the media who was trying to drive a wedge between him and Trump –– also declaring it wouldn't work. A Trump spokesperson even felt the need to clarify that the actual president-elect is, in fact, the leader of the Republican Party. I promise you that's not exactly a statement you want to have to make.” Psaki added with a smile.
