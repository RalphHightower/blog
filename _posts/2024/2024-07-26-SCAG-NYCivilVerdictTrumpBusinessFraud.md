## [Attorney General Alan Wilson leads 15-state brief supporting Trump appeal & reversal of $355 million court order - South Carolina Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/news/attorney-general-alan-wilson-leads-15-state-brief-supporting-trump-appeal-reversal-of-355-million-court-order/)

JUL 26, 2024

COLUMBIA, [S.C.) – [South Carolina](https://www.sc.gov/) [Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/) [Alan Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general/) led a [15-state coalition](https://republicanags.com/) in filing a brief today supporting former [President Trump’s](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) appeal of a court ordering him to pay around [\$355 million](https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2024/attorney-general-james-wins-landmark-victory-case-against-donald-trump) for allegedly making false real estate statements.

Earlier this year, a state court judge in [New York](https://www.ny.gov%) found [former President Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) liable for allegedly “[submitting false financial statements to banks and insurance companies to obtain better rates on loans and insurance coverage](https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2021/statement-attorney-general-james-criminal-indictment-trump-organization-and-cfo).” The judge then awarded a “disgorgement of ill-gotten gains” against former President Trump in the amount of approximately [\$355 million](https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2024/attorney-general-james-wins-landmark-victory-case-against-donald-trump), before pre-judgment interest. Mr. Trump has appealed to New York’s intermediate appellate court.

“Our brief isn’t about [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), it’s about upholding the rule of law and the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/),” [Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/) [Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general/) said. “We argue that this award is an excessive fine under the [Eighth Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-8/) and also violates the Due Process Clause of the [Fourteenth Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-14/).”

The citizens of [South Carolina](https://www.sc.gov/) and the other states in this coalition conduct business in [New York](https://www.ny.gov/), primarily [New York City](https://www.nyc.gov/), [the brief states](https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2021/statement-attorney-general-james-criminal-indictment-trump-organization-and-cfo), “And they need confidence that their customary business dealings in [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) will not subject them to devastating fines. The [Supreme Court’s](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) disgorgement order will have a chilling effect on business conducted by citizens of amici states.”

In addition to [South Carolina](https://www.scag.gov/), the following states joined the amicus brief: [Alabama](https://www.alabamaag.gov/), [Alaska](https://law.alaska.gov/), [Florida](https://www.myfloridalegal.com/), [Iowa](https://www.iowaattorneygeneral.gov/), [Louisiana](https://ag.louisiana.gov/), [Missouri](https://ago.mo.gov/), [Montana](https://dojmt.gov/), [Nebraska](https://ago.nebraska.gov/), [North Dakota](https://attorneygeneral.nd.gov/), [Ohio](https://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/), [Oklahoma](https://oklahoma.gov/oag.html), [South Dakota](https://atg.sd.gov/#gsc.tab=0), [Utah](https://attorneygeneral.utah.gov/), and [West Virginia](https://ago.wv.gov/Pages/default.aspx).
