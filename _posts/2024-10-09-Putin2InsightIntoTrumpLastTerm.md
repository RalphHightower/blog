  **Secret COVID-19 Tests**: In 2020, President Trump secretly sent COVID-19 tests to Russian President Putin during a shortage.
- **Trump-Putin Relationship**: The book "War" by Bob Woodward highlights the ongoing personal relationship between Trump and Putin, with multiple private calls reported.
- **Book's Conclusion**: Woodward concludes that Trump is worse than Nixon, citing his impulsive and reckless behavior.
- **Biden's Leadership**: The book contrasts Trump with President Biden, portraying Biden as exhibiting steady leadership despite some mistakes.

Trump’s advisers having clandestine meetings with foreign country officials? Trump is a r9gue loose cannon. Regarding
Hurricane Helene relief, Trump is undermining government relief by spreading falsehoods; but lies are expected from pathological liar.
 Seven phone calls to Putin as a private citizen? Trump is a ro7ge, loose cannon.

In one scene, Woodward recounts a moment at Mar-a-Lago where Trump tells a senior aide to leave the room so “he
 could have what he said was a private phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin.”

“According to Trump’s aide, there have been multiple phone calls between Trump and Putin, maybe as many as seven
in the period since Trump left the White House in 2021,” Woodward writes.

Woodward also writes about Trump’s decision to run for president again, including a series of conversations
with his ally and golfing buddy, Sen. Lindsey Graham. “Going to Mar-a-Lago is a little bit like going to North
Korea,” Graham said. “Everybody stands up and claps every time Trump comes in.” The South Carolina Republican
is quoted as saying Biden “won fair and square” but that Trump “doesn’t like to hear that.” Woodward goes on
to describe Graham’s attempts to give Trump campaign advice for 2024.
