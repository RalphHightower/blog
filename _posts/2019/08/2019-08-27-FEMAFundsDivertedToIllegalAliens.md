@RalphHightower: During the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, my wife was talking to her brother, and she mentioned that [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) diverted [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/) funds to illegal aliens. I will refute [Trump‚Äôs lies](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). Since she was on the phone, I texted her, "[FEMA money](https://www.fema.gov/) is [FEMA money](https://www.fema.gov/)." There is a bit of truth that [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/), but it didn't happen on [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/)'s or [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/)'s watch.

WASHINGTON ‚Äî The [Trump administration](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/) is pulling \$271 million in funding from the [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/), including the [Federal Emergency Management Agency](https://www.fema.gov/)'s Disaster Relief Fund, to pay for immigration detention space and temporary hearing locations for asylum-seekers who have been forced to wait in [Mexico](https://www.gob.mx/), according to department officials and a letter sent to the agency by a [California](https://www.ca.gov/) congresswoman.

To fund temporary locations for court hearings for asylum-seekers along the southern border, [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) would gain \$155 million, all from [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/)‚Äôs Disaster Relief Fund, according to the letter from [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-CA), which was seen by [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/).

The allocations were sent to [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) as a notification rather than a request, because the [administration](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/) believes it has the authority to repurpose these funds after [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) did not pass more funding for [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) detention beds as part of an emergency funding bill for the southwest border in June.

[Click here to read the notification](https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/6345992-DHS-FY-2019-Southwest-Border-Emergency-Transfer/?embed=1).

Specifically, the [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/) will lose \$116 million previously allocated for [Coast Guard](https://www.uscg.mil/) operations, aviation security and other components in order to fund nearly 6,800 more beds for immigrant detainees, the officials said.

‚ÄúWe would not say this is with no risk, but we would say that we worked it in a way to‚Ä¶minimize the risk. This was a must pay bill that needed to be addressed,‚Äù said a [DHS](https://www.dhs.gov/) official, who noted that the funds would begin transfer immediately to fund [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) through Sept. 30.

Combined with existing space, the funding would allow [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) to detain nearly 50,000 immigrants at one time.

The [Trump administration](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/) has claimed that the sudden rise in border crossings in 2019 has overwhelmed resources at the border, and that the lack of detention space at [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) has caused backlogs at border stations that offer migrants substandard conditions.

In July, there were 82,049 undocumented migrants who were apprehended or presented themselves at the southwest border, a sharp decline from over 144,000 in May, but still double the number seen the same month the previous year.

The \$155 million for court hearings was originally allocated to [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/) in 2006 and 2007, but would have been used in the current budget to prepare to respond to natural disasters, such as hurricanes.

The [administration](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/) began sending Central American migrants back to [Mexico](https://www.gob.mx/) to await their court hearings in the U.S. as a means of slowing down the number of asylum-seekers who present themselves for asylum and remain in the U.S. until their court hearing. The funding will allow those immigrants waiting in [Mexico](https://www.gob.mx/) to have their cases heard at the border rather than being transported to locations within the interior of the country.

‚ÄúI object to the use of funds for that purpose because the Department has provided no substantiation for a claim that this transfer is necessary due to ‚Äòextraordinary circumstances that imminently threaten the safety of human life or the protection of property,‚Äô‚Äù Roybal-Allard said, referring to a provision that would allow [DHS](https://www.dhs.gov/) to repurpose funds at this point in the budget cycle without notifying [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/).

[Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) Jon Tester (D-MT), the ranking [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) on the [Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security](https://www.senate.gov/general/committee_membership/committee_memberships_SSAP.htm#SSAP14), also expressed reservations about the [administration](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/)'s plan.

"I have grave concerns about [DHS](https://www.dhs.gov/)'s proposed end-run around laws passed by [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) that would drain millions from agencies tasked with protecting the homeland from security threats and natural disasters like hurricanes and wildfires ‚Äî including [CBP](https://www.cbp.gov/), [TSA](https://www.tsa.gov/), [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/) and the [Coast Guard](https://www.uscg.mil/)," Tester said in a statement.

"[Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) has already deliberated [DHS](https://www.dhs.gov/)'s request and appropriated the highest-ever funding for border security and immigration enforcement, which passed on a bipartisan basis and was signed by [President Trump](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/)," he added.
