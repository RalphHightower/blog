## [Unpaid bills haunt Trump's Halloween rally in Albuquerque, leave campaign scrambling for venue](https://www.salon.com/2024/10/31/unpaid-bills-haunt-halloween-rally-in-albuquerque-leave-campaign-scrambling-for-venue/)

Albuquerque is just one of many cities seeking to recoup unpaid fees from Trump's campaign stops over the last decade. Municipalities in Texas and Pennsylvania are still after more than $750,000, per an NBC News analysis shared earlier this month.

In Albuquerque, the convention center Trump hoped to use was undergoing planned maintenance. When the former president came calling, city officials weren't going out of their way to help Trump secure a second location.
