excerpt: "Smith's filing tries to slice through the [Supreme] Court's security shield regarding the insurrection. Skillfully quoting from or alluding to language in the Court majority's own opinion, the filing demolishes the notion that Trump's activities, culminating on January 6, deserve immunity. Consider, for example, Smith's telling of Trump's reaction to the news from one of his staff, at the height of the violence on January 6, that his tweets attacking Pence had placed Pence's life in extreme danger. 'So what?' Trump reportedly replied. He had clearly intended for his tweets to reach the mob at the Capitol. His nonchalance about the vice president's life epitomizes the lengths to which he would go to complete his coup d'état."

- **Prosecutor's Strategy**: Jack Smith has cleverly framed Donald Trump's actions as personal to sidestep the Supreme Court's ruling on presidential immunity.
- **Supreme Court Ruling**: The Court's decision on July 1 granted Trump broad immunity from prosecution for official acts.
- **New Evidence**: Smith's October 2 evidence brief includes previously unknown details about Trump's actions during the January 6 Capitol riot.
- **Future Implications**: The continuation of Trump's prosecution depends on the outcome of the upcoming presidential election.

Federal prosecutor Jack Smith reframed the indictment of Donald Trump's attempt
to overturn the election as Donald Trump, the private citizen, running for
reelection, bypassing the potential probles regarding the overly broad
*"presidential immunity"* that was granted by the Supreme Court.
