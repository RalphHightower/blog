Watch how Trump shamelessly claims credit for Biden's achievements - from insulin pricing to infrastructure projects - while planning to destroy these same programs once in office. See his pattern of taking credit for successes and denying all failures, even as progressives attempt to work with him for the American people. The master of "heads I win, tails you lose" strikes again.

It doesn't matter who was president when the US withdrew from Afghanistan. The operation would have been a fuck-up. Trump plans on blaming generals and court-martials for those who planned the withdrawal. Trump claims that he learned all about military operations from his boarding school, New York Military Academy.
