Frankly, I prefer the Lucida Sans font family.

*As the nation’s chief diplomat turns his attention to typefaces, it’s hard not to wonder: Doesn’t he have better things to do?*

Dec. 11, 2025, 9:52 AM EST
By [Steve Benen](https://www.ms.now/author/steve-benen)

When the [State Department](https://www.state.gov/) changed the fonts on official documents to [Calibri](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/calibri) in 2023, it had a good reason. As [The New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/11/us/calibri-font-history-rubio-times-new-roman.html), the move “was intended to improve accessibility for readers with disabilities, such as low vision and dyslexia, and for people using assistive technologies, like screen readers.”

This week, the department undid that move. [Reuters reported](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/rubio-stages-font-coup-times-new-roman-ousts-calibri-2025-12-09/):

> *[U.S. Secretary](https://www.state.gov/biographies/marco-rubio) of [State](https://www.state.gov/) [Marco Rubio](https://www.state.gov/biographies/marco-rubio) on Tuesday ordered diplomats to return to using [Times New Roman](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/times-new-roman) font in official communications, calling his predecessor [Antony Blinken](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/administration/cabinet/)’s decision to adopt [Calibri](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/calibri) a ‘wasteful’ diversity move, according to an internal department cable seen by [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/).*

The [Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) report on this added that for the nation’s chief diplomat, who [issued](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/09/us/politics/rubio-state-department-font.html) an “Action Request” memo to U.S. posts around the world, reversing course on font selection was part of “a push to stamp out diversity efforts and … return to tradition.”

Put another way, improving accessibility for readers with disabilities was, you know, woke.

[Ruth Ben-Ghiat](https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/ruth-ben-ghiat.html), a [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/) professor who studies authoritarian rulers, [noted soon after](https://bsky.app/profile/ruthbenghiat.bsky.social/post/3m7nnpi6ehc24) that Italy’s Benito Mussolini “had this level of micro-managing, including which fonts could be used in newspapers.”

Indeed, after seeing these reports this week, it was hard not to wonder how in the world the [Florida Republican](https://www.state.gov/biographies/marco-rubio) managed to find time to make this a priority. When it comes to high-profile and powerful federal officials, [Rubio](https://www.state.gov/biographies/marco-rubio) is [simultaneously wearing more hats](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/rubios-latest-moves-raise-fresh-doubts-future-national-security-counci-rcna207132) than anyone in modern American history, serving as the secretary of state, the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) national security adviser, the acting administrator of the [U.S. Agency for International Development](https://www.usaid.gov/) and the acting archivist for the [National Archives](https://www.archives.gov/).

The last time I checked, he’s also playing a direct role in trying to negotiate an end to the deadliest war in Europe since World War II, while moving the U.S. closer to possible military intervention in [Venezuela](https://gob.ve/).

And this is the moment that the top diplomat for the world’s preeminent superpower decided to issue an international declaration to U.S. embassies, missions and outposts about … a typeface?

As ridiculous as this might seem, it’s part of a pattern in which [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Cabinet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/) officials can’t seem to shake their interest in distractions and trivialities. [Transportation](https://www.transportation.gov/) [Secretary Sean Duffy](https://www.transportation.gov/meet-secretary/us-transportation-secretary-sean-duffy) has devoted time to helping air travelers [who want to do pull-ups at airports](https://www.c-span.org/clip/news-conference/pull-up-competition-between-secretaries-kennedy-and-duffy/5183603). [Defense](https://www.defense.gov/) [Secretary Pete Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) has invested a bizarre amount of interest in [paintings, library books and grooming standards](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/hegseth-imposes-new-press-restrictions-eyes-greater-pentagon-control-a-rcna232893). [Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/) [Secretary Kristi Noem](https://www.dhs.gov/kristi-noem) has embraced [camera-ready tactics](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-houses-approach-performative-politics-takes-ugly-turn-rcna225815) and performative politics to an almost cartoonish degree.

And then, of course, there’s [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) himself, who appears far more interested [in ballrooms and bathrooms](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-taps-new-ballroom-architect-for-300-million-white-house-vanity-project) than governance.

As [Rubio](https://www.state.gov/biographies/marco-rubio) joins the club and turns his attention to fonts, it’s hard not to wonder: Don’t these guys have more important things to do?
