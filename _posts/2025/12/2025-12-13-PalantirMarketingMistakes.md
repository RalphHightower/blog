## [Palantir co-founders keep mistaking violence for masculine virtue](https://www.ms.now/opinion/palantir-co-founders-keep-mistaking-violence-for-masculine-virtue)

*[Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/)’s Alex Karp and [Joe Lonsdale](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jtlonsdale/) have violent visions for America, and they’re using claims about masculinity to defend it.*

A strain of violent hypermasculinity seems to be driving the men who built [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/), the technology firm with billions of dollars in government contracts that’s aiding [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [racist](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://fortune.com/2025/12/05/trump-somalia-immigration-garbage-racism/&ved=2ahUKEwiRv47c866RAxXLW0EAHc4cMyEQvOMEKAB6BAgZEAE&usg=AOvVaw1E72C7A_RQVG3uItg25Hr1) [anti-immigrant crackdown](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.ms.now/top-stories/latest/homeland-security-social-media-white-supremacy-rcna228582&ved=2ahUKEwi1vLHs866RAxVzUEEAHfRrIuoQFnoECBwQAQ&usg=AOvVaw3Tm6EsW9xyw-ZEzyNVhl6g). 

[Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/) CEO and co-founder Alex Karp [boasted to investors back in February](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/02/palantir-alex-karp-trump-private-prisons-profiteers/) about his company’s ability to help the government “scare” and “kill” its perceived enemies. More recently, he’s been on [something](https://fortune.com/2025/11/13/palantir-ceo-alex-karp-slams-critics-surveillence-state-military-tech-patriotism-mind-virus/) of a [press tour](https://www.axios.com/2025/11/06/palantir-ceo-surveillance-ice-axios-interview) in an effort to [downplay reports](https://reason.com/2025/06/02/palantir-paves-way-for-trump-police-state/) that his company is helping [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [build a surveillance state](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/technology/trump-palantir-data-americans.html) that can be used [to harass](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/24/palantir-artificial-intelligence-civil-rights) and [spy on the administration’s foes](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/blog/ice-immigrationos-palantir-ai-track-immigrants/).

Karp has also used this press tour to promote the absurd idea that his company is a bulwark against [some sort of war on masculinity](https://x.com/shannonrwatts/status/1987656977766347015?s=46&t=MOrgn1OciSYSUInllbgRZw). This fusion of hypermasculine agita with [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/)’s mission emerged last week during a public meltdown Karp had while defending his company’s work.

During a sit-down interview at [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/)’ Dealbook Summit, he [berated the Times](https://x.com/rolandsmartin/status/1996560552890695918?s=46&t=MOrgn1OciSYSUInllbgRZw) for its reporting on his company’s data collection practices for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and [defended](https://fortune.com/2025/12/04/palantir-ceo-alex-karp-defends-being-arrogant-prick-more-ceos-should-be/) himself as an “arrogant prick.” Karp also [suggested](https://www.youtube.com/live/8i-ys9faa74?t=627) that media criticism of his company doesn’t matter to him because he has the affection of millions of American men:

Mainstream media at the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) and at [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) doesn’t always like me. But that’s great, because you know who does like me? About 10 million people — primarily dudes — in this country. And you know what? I’m gonna use my whole influence to make sure this country stays skeptical of migration and has a deterrent capacity that it only uses selectively.

(“Selectively,” of course, can have a variety of meanings.)

Karp also [said](https://gizmodo.com/palantir-ceo-says-making-war-crimes-constitutional-would-be-good-for-business-2000695162) it would be good for his business if the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s controversial boat bombings in international waters — which [some legal experts](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/04/venezuela-boat-strikes-legality-hegseth) have suggested might constitute war crimes — were deemed constitutional. And he [doubled down](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DR7TdGzDQEr/) on a previous claim that the United States’ power and influence is not exerted through its ideas but via “organized violence.” 

This kind of hypermasculine violence was echoed by another [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/) co-founder in recent days. Last week, [Joe Lonsdale](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jtlonsdale/) [shared a social media post](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/palantir-joe-lonsdale-public-hangings-b2880262.html) in which he endorsed the idea of public hangings as a way to demonstrate what he called “masculine leadership.”

Meanwhile, other founding members of [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/) have been generating controversy in other ways.

Far-right Silicon Valley billionaire [Peter Thiel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterthiel/), who helped launch the company years ago, has raised eyebrows with [his apocalyptic fantasies](https://jacobin.com/2025/11/peter-thiel-palantir-apocalypse-antichrist) about vanquishing an “Antichrist” that he believes is wreaking havoc in global politics. And [David Sacks](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidoliversacks/), who also helped fund the organization when it was started, has [been raging](https://www.ms.now/opinion/trump-ai-czar-david-sacks-new-york-times) online against ,- 
[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) over its report on his alleged self-dealing as [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency czar. 

That such mercurial and emotional men are the ones who established the tech company that’s enabling the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s illiberal crackdown on immigrants (or anyone else who finds themselves in the [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/)’s crosshairs) should raise alarms.
