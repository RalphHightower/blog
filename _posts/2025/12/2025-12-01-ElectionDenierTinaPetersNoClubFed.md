## [Colorado rebuffs Trump effort to transfer Tina Peters to federal custody](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/colorado-rebuffs-trump-effort-to-transfer-tina-peters-to-federal-custody)

*The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and his team are still trying to intervene in the case of a convicted former county clerk. It’s not going well.*


Dec. 1, 2025, 11:26 AM EST
By [Steve Benen](https://www.ms.now/author/steve-benen)

A few weeks ago, the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s efforts to help former [Colorado](https://co.colorado.gov/) county clerk Tina Peters reached a new level: [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s Federal [Bureau of Prisons](https://www.bop.gov/) contacted the [Colorado](https://co.colorado.gov/) [Department of Corrections](https://cdoc.colorado.gov/), seeking to transfer Peters from a state prison to federal custody.

Evidently, the request was not well received. [The Associated Press reported](https://apnews.com/article/colorado-clerk-election-conspiracy-0a2cb663691cacae63ba8cd98d692bcf):

> **[Colorado](https://co.colorado.gov/) doesn’t plan to transfer from state prison to federal custody a former county clerk who has become a hero to election conspiracy theorists following a request from the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/), state officials said Wednesday. The [Colorado](https://co.colorado.gov/) [Department of Corrections](https://cdoc.colorado.gov/) said it is not seeking a transfer of Tina Peters, who was convicted last year of orchestrating a scheme in [Mesa County]() to breach voting machine data driven by false claims of fraud in the 2020 election.**

“Transferring an individual is an action initiated by the [Colorado](https://co.colorado.gov/) [Department of Corrections](https://cdoc.colorado.gov/), not an outside entity,” department spokesperson Alondra Gonzalez-Garcia told the AP.

In case anyone needs [a refresher](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/two-tiered-system-trump-calls-tina-peters-freed-prison-rcna205070), Peters didn’t just embrace [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s lies and conspiracy theories about his [2020 election defeat](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf), she also acted on them, using someone’s security badge to allow a Mike Lindell associate to access county election equipment.

The apparent point of the endeavor was to leak election machinery data in pursuit of a conspiratorial plot that never existed in reality.

Not surprisingly, Peters was caught and indicted. She pleaded not guilty, but after she and her attorney struggled to present a compelling defense, a [Colorado](https://co.colorado.gov/) jury convicted Peters, finding her guilty of three counts of attempting to influence a public servant, one count of conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation, first-degree official misconduct, violation of duty and failing to comply with the secretary of state.

Ahead of sentencing, Peters [showed no remorse](https://x.com/RonFilipkowski/status/1841911266526306526). A judge ultimately sentenced her to [nine years behind bars](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/election-denying-ex-county-clerk-receives-9-year-prison-sentence-rcna173916).

For the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), that’s apparently not acceptable.

In early March, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Department of Justice](https;//www.justice.gov/) raised eyebrows [with an unexpected move](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/justice-department-takes-interest-tina-peters-conviction-colorado-rcna194675): The [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/)’s civil division unexpectedly filed a brief in federal court, raising “concerns” about the criminal conviction of a former [Colorado](https://co.colorado.gov/) county clerk named Tina Peters.

The effort didn’t amount to much, but the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s interest in the case didn’t fade. In May, the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [not only called for Peters’ release from prison](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/two-tiered-system-trump-calls-tina-peters-freed-prison-rcna205070), he also directed the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) to take “all necessary action” to help secure her freedom. As part of the same [online harangue](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114457992767716636), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), who lacks the authority to pardon those convicted of state crimes, went on to describe Peters as a “Political Prisoner” and a “hostage” whose trial deserved to be seen as “a Communist persecution.”

In August, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [threatened [Colorado](https://co.colorado.gov/) with “harsh measures”](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-free-tina-peters-colorado-harsh-measures-rcna226315) unless the state agreed to release Peters, whom he claimed had been “tortured by Crooked [Colorado](https://co.colorado.gov/) politicians.”

The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) kept this up in September, [vowing to “do something”](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3ly4kgpync32a) on her behalf. He returned to the subject [early last week](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115599455037289127).

Despite the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)’s apparent interest in her case, there’s effectively nothing he can do: This was a state official, charged with state crimes, by state prosecutors, in a state court, with a state jury, overseen by a state judge, [which necessarily means](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/05/us/trump-news/8eb90ce9-0a48-52f5-80f9-504170f3b161?smid=url-share) neither the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) nor his [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) can overturn Peters’ criminal conviction.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) apparently intends to keep trying anyway, though there’s no reason to believe he’ll succeed.

For his part, Peters’ defense attorney recently told [Steve Bannon](https://warroom.org/)  that he’d like to see the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) deploy U.S. military personnel to the [Colorado](https://co.colorado.gov/) prison where Peters is being held in order to free her. The lawyer [did not appear to be kidding](https://bsky.app/profile/kylec.bsky.social/post/3m6iqm3asj22k).
