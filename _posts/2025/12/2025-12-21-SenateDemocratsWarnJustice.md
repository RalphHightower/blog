## [‘We smell a rat’: Senate Dem warns of consequences if DOJ fails to release Epstein files](https://www.ms.now/news/jeffrey-epstein-files-release-jeff-merkley-democrats-consequences-trump)

*“We do not think the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is going to release the information on Friday by midnight that Americans are expecting,” [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Jeff Merkley](https://www.merkley.senate.gov/) told [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/).*

The deadline is nearing for the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) to release all of its files related to disgraced financier [Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.ms.now/opinion/jeffrey-epstein-trump-clinton-gates-photos-conspiracy). Last month, [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) passed the bipartisan [Epstein Files Transparency Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/4405/text), which requires the government to make public all material on the convicted sex offender by the end of Friday.

Ahead of that deadline, [Democratic lawmakers](https://www.ms.now/news/senate-democrats-threaten-to-sue-trump-doj-over-epstein-files) are warning the Trump [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) that there will be repercussions if it fails to comply. Sens. [Ben Ray Luján (D-NM)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PKZovd2MYg) and [Jeff Merkley (D-OR)](https://www.ms.now/top-stories/latest/trump-resistance-pushback-creativity-jeff-merkley-rcna239343), who both sponsored the initial legislation, have threatened to block any pending civilian nominees before the Senate until the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) releases the documents.

“There can be no business as usual until justice is delivered for the victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s horrific crimes,” [the senators wrote in a statement](https://www.merkley.senate.gov/merkley-lujan-no-business-as-usual-until-justice-delivered-for-jeffrey-epsteins-victims/).

On Wednesday, [Merkley](https://www.merkley.senate.gov/) joined [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/)’s [“The Weeknight”](https://www.ms.now/the-weeknight) to discuss his concerns and whether he thought [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) would join [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) in fighting for transparency from [Donald Trump](https://www.ms.now/white-house)’s [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/).

“Look, we smell a rat,” [Merkley](https://www.merkley.senate.gov/) said. “We do not think the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is going to release the information on Friday by midnight that Americans are expecting. I think they’re going to use one excuse or another and we’re going to see a whole lot of blanked-out pages.”

The [Oregon Democrat](https://www.merkley.senate.gov/) noted that shortly before the Epstein legislation passed, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) directed the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) to [open new investigations](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/us/politics/trump-bondi-democrats-justice-department.html) into several [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) whose names had been included in previously released documents from the late financier’s estate.

Any open investigations would likely make it easier for the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) to justify not releasing some documents.

[Merkley](https://www.merkley.senate.gov/) said that by launching investigations, the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) created “an excuse to say, ‘Hey, if there’s investigations underway, maybe we can’t release information, might compromise those investigations,’” adding that the “whole thing sounded very, very phony.”

The senator said he and his colleagues have “experts lined up from all different sectors” to look over whatever files the government hands over. “They know kind of what’s supposed to be there, and if it’s not there we’re going to be getting their feedback,” he said. “If the pages are simply missing, they’re missing. But if they’re blacked out, well, that will be obvious to all of America.”

[Merkley](https://www.merkley.senate.gov/) also said he thinks there is [“Republican partnership”](https://www.ms.now/news/republicans-rebuke-trump-epstein-vote-rcna244688) on the issue. “Listen, the [MAGA](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) base believed that these files needed to be released. They came down on this side of ‘We’re not going to protect pedophiles,’ and so we have that support,” he said.
