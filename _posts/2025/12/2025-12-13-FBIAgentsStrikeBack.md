title: "Agents Strike Back. The Saga of Justice Restored."
---


```
Episode VIII
AGENTS STRIKE BACK

It is a time of upheaval.
The Bureau, once guardians of justice
against corruption and white‑collar crime,
has been cast into shadow.

Under Patel’s decree and Trump’s reign,
morale has been shattered.  
Agents are stripped of their mission,
relegated to immigrant enforcement,
their scholarly discipline abandoned.

The decree of “no degree” spreads,
dumbing down the ranks,  
erasing the legacy of rigor
that once defined the order.

Yet across the nation,
fired investigators stir.  
Whispers of resistance grow louder,
as they rally to reclaim their purpose.

In a galaxy not so far away,
the Agents strike lead up.
```

The mission of the [Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)](https://www.fbi.gov/) is to investigate:

- Civil Rights 
- Counterintelligence
- Cyber
- Public Corruption 
- Terrorism 
- Violent Crime
- Transnational Organized Crime
- Weapons of Mass Destruction
- White-Collar Crime

Yet their core mission has been usurped for immigration deportation. Four year college degrees were required for the government’s top law investigative and enforcement agency. But [lPatel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) has dumbed down the elite agency to require just a high school education. 

## [Following Kash Patel’s purge, ousted FBI officials fight back in court](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/following-kash-patels-purge-ousted-fbi-officials-fight-back-in-court)

*The [bureau](https://www.fbi.gov/)’s [director](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) has spent much of the year firing personnel for political reasons. The result is a trio of important civil suits.*

By [Steve Benen](https://www.ms.now/author/steve-benen)

[FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Director Kash Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s tenure has been a national embarrassment in a great many ways, but among the most jarring developments this year is the sheer volume of bureau personnel who’ve been [purged for political reasons](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/fbi-agents-association-kash-patel-disregarded-law-latest-personnel-pur-rcna241928), leaving the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) destabilized.

[MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/)’s [Ken Dilanian noted](https://x.com/DilanianMSNBC/status/1953525021571178719) noted that the ongoing purge “is without precedent in the modern history of the [bureau](https://www.fbi.gov/). It raises questions about whether the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) is trying to turn the nation’s most powerful law enforcement agency into an instrument of [presidential](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) whim — exactly the thing he baselessly accused his opponent of doing.”

That was in August. [Things are worse now](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/fbi-agents-association-kash-patel-disregarded-law-latest-personnel-pur-rcna241928).

For those concerned with justice and the integrity of federal law enforcement, that’s the bad news. The good news is that many of those who’ve been peremptorily fired are fighting back in court. [NPR](https://www.npr.org/) reported, for example, that 12 [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) agents who were fired this year for taking a knee during racial justice protests in 2020 are now suing [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) and the bureau, alleging unlawful retaliation.

According to the former agents’ court filing, they were backed against a wall in the middle of a protest and took a knee to de-escalate a situation that threatened to escalate. [From the report](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/08/g-s1-100970/fbi-agents-kneel-protest-lawsuit):

> *The former special agents — who together have nearly 200 years of experience — once received awards for helping disrupt mass shootings, expose foreign spies and thwart cyber attacks.*

But they say as elite federal law enforcement agents, they never received training on crowd control, nor did they have riot shields, gas masks, or helmets when they faced down volatile crowds in the streets of [Washington, D.C.](https://dc.gov/), in June 2020.

The [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) inspector general [reviewed the incident](https://oig.justice.gov/news/doj-oig-releases-report-dojs-response-protest-activity-and-civil-unrest-washington-dc-late-may) in 2024 and found no misconduct. Similarly, according to the agents’ version of events, then-[FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Director Chris Wray](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/christopher-wray) said they did the right thing under difficult circumstances, and then-[FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) Deputy Director [David Bowdich](https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/leaders/david-l-bowdich/) told the agents they wouldn’t be punished.

But after [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) returned to the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), those who took a knee were fired anyway, with [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) accusing them in their dismissal letters of “unprofessional conduct and a lack of impartiality in carrying out duties, leading to the political weaponization of government.”

Commenting on the absurdity of these agents’ ouster, their lawyer [told The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/08/us/politics/kash-patel-fbi-lawsuit-george-floyd-protest.html), “The country is less safe than it was before these [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) agents were fired en masse.” She added that the abrupt dismissals violated the bureau’s own internal rules, which protect not only the agents, but also the country by “ensuring that people who are highly trained and effective are employed at the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/).”

Time will tell what may come of the civil litigation, but it’s worth emphasizing for context that they’re not the only ousted [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) personnel who’ve turned to the courts to put things right.

[The Associated Press reported](https://apnews.com/article/fbi-progress-pride-flag-lawsuit-83c0d9750e9bf6a11a11b858420750a2):

> *A veteran [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) employee training to become a special agent was fired last month for displaying at his workspace an LGBTQ+ flag, which had previously flown outside a field office, according to a lawsuit filed in federal court.*

> *David Maltinsky had worked at the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) for 16 years and was nearly finished with special agent training in [Quantico](https://www.townofquantico.org/), [Virginia](https://www.virginia.gov/), when he was called into a meeting last month with [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) officials, given a letter from [Director Kash Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) and told he was being ‘summarily dismissed’ over the inappropriate display of political signage, Maltinsky’s lawsuit said.*

What’s more, in August, [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) and his team ousted [ousted three experienced bureau leaders](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/fbi-abuses-misuses-generate-angry-reactions-bureau-veterans-agents-ass-rcna224329), including Brian Driscoll, a widely respected figure among rank-and-file agents who was removed [after he helped prevent](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/top-fbi-official-forced-criticizing-trump-pursuit-agents-investigated-rcna194610) a mass firing of thousands of [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) officials who worked on Jan. 6 cases.

A month later, [MS NOW reported](https://www.ms.now/msnbc/news/kash-patel-fbi-lawsuit-firings-illegal-rcna230368) on their federal lawsuit, which alleged that [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) “knowingly broke the law when he fired senior [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) executives at the behest of the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and under pressure from [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) allies.”

These cases are now starting to advance through the legal process, and it’s too soon to speculate about their possible outcomes. But they clearly pose legal and political problems for [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) and the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/).
