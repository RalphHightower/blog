title: "Like a Cockroach, Jim Jordan (T-OH4) Scurries Into Darkness For Jack Smith Testimony"
---

🎶 Parody: “Like a Cockroach”

_(Weird Al–style satire inspired by Madonna’s “Like a Virgin”)_

Like a cockroach,
Hiding under a rock,
Preferring darkness,
Afraid of the public shock.

Jack Smith’s on the calendar,
December seventeenth’s the day,
He offered to go public,
But Jordan said “No way!”

Like a cockroach,
Creeping out of sight,
Like a cockroach,
Afraid of the nation’s light.

*The [former special counsel](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) wanted the public to see his Q&A with the [House Judiciary Committee](https://judiciary.house.gov/). The panel’s [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) [chair](http://judiciary.house.gov/the-committee/the-chairman) has literally and figuratively slammed the door on that idea.*

Dec. 4, 2025, 9:43 AM EST
By [Steve Benen](https://www.ms.now/author/steve-benen)

As 2025 got underway, then-[special counsel Jack Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) [grudgingly stepped down](https://www.ms.now/top-stories/latest/jack-smith-resigns-justice-department-trump-rcna187281) after the [2024 election results](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/2024presgeresults.pdf) [derailed his criminal cases](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/sen-mike-lee-doesnt-understand-jack-smiths-cases-rcna182012) against [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). As 2025 nears its end, however, the prosecutor remains a popular target for [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/)’ ire.

The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) continues to [peddle baseless attacks](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/january-6-fbi-republican-conspiracy-theory-rcna236367) against the [former special counsel](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith); the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) [continues](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/kash-patel-fires-yet-another-group-fbi-agents-cause-shutters-corruptio-rcna236490) to [push out](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/doj-fires-career-prosecutors-team-trumps-revenge-tour-continues-rcna189586?icid=previouspost_bot) officials who worked with [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith); and assorted [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) voices continue to go after him with [unhinged and easily discredited](https://www.thedailybeast.com/eric-trump-goes-full-tin-full-hat-in-rant-against-his-dads-nemesis/) conspiracy theories.

On Capitol Hill, [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) lawmakers remain eager to treat [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) like a punching bag. [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Michael Rulli (T-OH6)](https://rulli.house.gov/) [recently accused](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3m3uifejwj22a) the prosecutor of acts that he said bordered on “treason”; [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Marsha Blackburn (T-TN)](https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/) [referred Smith to the Justice Department](https://thehill.com/homenews/5561372-marsha-blackburn-jack-smith-doj-probe/) for a misconduct investigation, based on [misguided allegations](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/us/politics/jack-smith-phone-records-republicans.html) the [Tennessee Republican](https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/) [did not appear to understand](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/january-6-fbi-republican-conspiracy-theory-rcna236367); and several [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) members have even [pushed for Smith’s disbarment](https://www.axios.com/2025/10/17/jack-smith-arctic-frost-marsha-blackburn-letter-doj).

To date, no [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) official has produced any evidence of [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) having done anything wrong. But the party’s hysterics continue unabated.

More recently, [House Judiciary Committee](https://judiciary.house.gov/) [Chairman](http://judiciary.house.gov/the-committee/the-chairman) [Jim Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/) [sent a letter](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/10/14/congress/jordan-wants-jack-smith-testimony-00607878) to [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) to demand his closed-door testimony. This week, the [Ohio Republican](https://jordan.house.gov/) took the next step. [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-tennessee-congress-immigration-nato-hegseth-live-updates-rcna246589/rcrd93810?canonicalCard=true):

> **[House Judiciary](https://judiciary.house.gov/) [Chair](http://judiciary.house.gov/the-committee/the-chairman) [Jim Jordan (T-OH4)](https//jordan.https://jordan.house.gov//), subpoenaed [former special counsel Jack Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) for a Dec. 17 deposition today, prompting [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith)’s lawyer to say they’re ‘disappointed’ [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) rejected the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) prosecutor’s offer to provide public testimony.**

In October, [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) notified the [House Judiciary Committee](https://judiciary.house.gov/) that he’d welcome the opportunity to answer lawmakers’ questions — [but he wanted a public hearing](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jack-smith-ready-respond-gop-questions-wants-public-see-answers-rcna239538) so that everyone could see and hear the questions and answers.

[Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/) refused, preferring secrecy to sunlight.

[Peter Koski](https://www.cov.com/en/professionals/k/peter-koski), who represents the former special counsel, said in a statement, “Nearly six weeks ago [Jack](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) offered to voluntarily appear before the [House Judiciary](https://judiciary.house.gov/) committee in an open hearing to answer any questions lawmakers have about his investigation into [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s alleged efforts to unlawfully overturn the election results and retention of classified documents.”

“We are disappointed that offer was rejected, and that the American people will be denied the opportunity to hear directly from [Jack](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) on these topics,” the statement continued. “[Jack](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) looks forward to meeting with the committee later this month to discuss his work and clarify the various misconceptions about his investigation.”

[Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) clearly wanted more transparency, but he wasn’t in a position to dictate the terms.

[The New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/12/03/us/trump-news/c665b349-d12c-56d9-a879-456e05554314?smid=url-share) that [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) “have been reluctant to give [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith)] a prime public platform out of concern that he could embarrass [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) by making a compelling case for the indictments over the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s attempt to overturn the [2020 election]({% January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}) and his retention of classified documents.”

Those concerns give away the game.

As we’ve [discussed](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-seek-jack-smiths-testimony-former-special-counsel-plenty-s-rcna237737), [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) is an experienced, credible and capable prosecutor who’s familiar with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s criminal cases at a granular level. The more [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) drag him back into the spotlight, the more [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) is positioned to remind the public not only of the variety of alleged [presidential](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) felonies, but also of evidence the party would prefer to forget.

For his part, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [told reporters](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/12/03/us/trump-news/6882c3ab-dba9-5517-ba19-beed0bcdf2b1?smid=url-share) on Wednesday afternoon, in reference to the former special counsel, “I’d rather see him testify publicly.”

[Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/) will likely ignore the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s preference, even as the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) probably ought to be careful what he wishes for.
