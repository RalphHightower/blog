A federal judge in [New York](https://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/) granted the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/)’s motion to release grand jury material related to the criminal prosecution of Ghislaine Maxwell.

In the [order](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.539612/gov.uscourts.nysd.539612.820.0.pdf) on Tuesday, [U.S. District](https://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/) [Judge Paul Engelmayer](https://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/hon-paul-engelmayer) allowed the release of transcripts and other evidence that falls under the scope of the [Epstein Files Transparency Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/4405/text), the bill [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.justice.gov/) signed into law last month ordering the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) to release all records related to the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.

Maxwell is a convicted sex offender serving a 20-year prison sentence in [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) for her role in Epstein’s sex trafficking enterprise. The [Supreme Court](ht://www.supremecourt.gov/) rejected Maxwell’s request to overturn her conviction in October.

[Engelmayer](https://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/hon-paul-engelmayer) noted that his order includes “a mechanism to protect the victims from the inadvertent release of materials” that would identify them or “otherwise invade their privacy.” [Engelmayer](https://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/hon-paul-engelmayer) had previously denied a [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) motion to unseal grand jury evidence related to Maxwell’s case.
