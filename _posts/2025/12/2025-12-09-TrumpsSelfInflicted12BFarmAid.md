The Arsonist Deserves No Credit For Putting Out Fires He Started.

## [Trump administration announces \$12 billion farm aid package](https://www.ms.now/news/trump-administration-announces-12-billion-farm-aid-package)

*The long-awaited relief comes on the heels of a tumultuous year for farmers, who won’t see the funds until February at the earliest, the [agriculture secretary](https://www.usda.gov/our-agency/about-usda/our-secretary) said.*

Dec. 9, 2025, 8:44 AM EST
By [Sydney Carruth](https://www.ms.now/author/sydney-carruth)

The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) on Monday announced a \$12 billion farm aid package that will provide financial assistance to American farmers, a key [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) base, whose industry has been hit hard by the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s wide-ranging tariff policies. 

The bulk of that money, up to \$11 billion, will be distributed as one-time payments to farmers of “row crops” via the [Agriculture Department](https://www.usda.gov/)’s new [Farmer Bridge Assistance Program](https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2025/12/08/trump-administration-announces-12-billion-farmer-bridge-payments-american-farmers-impacted-unfair).

The remaining \$1 billion will be set aside as a reserve fund for the department to deploy amid shifting economic conditions for “[specialty crop](https://www.ams.usda.gov/services/grants/scbgp/specialty-crop)” farmers, according to [Agriculture](https://www.usda.gov/) [Secretary Brooke Rollins](https://www.usda.gov/our-agency/about-usda/our-secretary). 

“We are very pleased to announce that today we are going to be effectuating an \$11 billion … bridge payment to our farmers,” [Rollins](https://www.usda.gov/our-agency/about-usda/our-secretary) said during a roundtable announcement with agriculture representatives at the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) on Monday afternoon. “The money will move by Feb. 28 of 2026.” 

[Rollins](https://www.usda.gov/our-agency/about-usda/our-secretary) added that farmers will be eligible to apply for the aid within the next two weeks, noting that her department is “holding \$1 billion” back to better understand the needs and market conditions of specialty crop farmers, who grow fruits and other products. 

The long-awaited aid announcement comes as row crop farmers, who rely on exporting commodity crops like soybeans, wheat, cotton and corn to international markets, have endured the negative economic consequences of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s trade agenda. 

The funding for the program, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said at the roundtable Monday, is a “small portion of the hundreds of billions of dollars we receive in tariffs.”

But American farmers, who voted overwhelmingly for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) in the 2024 election, expressed frustration over the loss of key international export markets amid [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s aggressive tariff policies. That, coupled with high input costs and low crop prices, has put a squeeze on an industry already vulnerable to natural disasters and climate fluctuation.

[China](https://www.gov.cn/), the largest export market for American soybeans, halted all soybean purchases in retaliation for the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s high reciprocal tariffs earlier this year, sourcing instead from American competitors [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/) and [Brazil](https://www.gov.br/planalto/en). 

Downward pressure on U.S. soybean prices in the absence of America’s biggest buyer caused bushels to reach near multiyear lows this summer, hovering around \$10 per bushel, according to [data](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Charts_and_Maps/Agricultural_Prices/pricesb.php) from the [Department of Agriculture](https://www.usda.gov/). 

“This growing season, U.S. soybean farmers have faced a perfect storm of low crop prices, high production costs, and loss of markets,” the [American Soybean Association](https://soygrowers.com/news-releases/asa-statement-on-12b-farmer-bridge-assistance-program/), which lobbies on behalf of soybean farmers, said in a statement. It called the Farmer Bridge Assistance Program “a positive first step.”

A ~~\$20~~ \$40 billion currency swap deal with [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/) in October further compounded American farmers’ frustration. They argued the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) was bailing out their competition as they struggled to stay afloat amid rising input costs. 

@RalphHightower: The [Argentine](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/) pesos currency swap was doubled. 

“Bailing out [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/) doesn’t help my market,” [Arkansas](https://portal.arkansas.gov/) soybean farmer Scott Brown [told MS NOW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szSr-VhYKWw) in October. “They’re my second-biggest competition. If we’re going to make American agriculture great and make it stand on its own two feet, then I need my second-biggest competitor to fail.” 

After [Beijing](https://www.beijing.gov.cn/) agreed to buy 12 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans this year as part of a trade agreement [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and Chinese President Xi Jinping reached in October, soybean purchases have slowly begun to climb. 

[China](https://www.gov.cn/) made its first purchase in line with that goal in November, buying 14 cargoes of U.S. soybeans, its first purchase since early January. That still lags behind what American farmers aim to export this year, and falls short of the 12 million tons of soybeans [China](https://www.gov.cn/) pledged to purchase by February. 

[Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/) [Secretary Scott Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) said during a [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) event last week that he believes [China](https://www.gov.cn/) is “on track” to meet the February  purchase goal. [Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) expressed the same confidence at the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) announcement on Monday, saying Xi “heard [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).”

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) added that the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) also plans to strip environmental regulations from agriculture machinery manufacturing as a means of easing production. He did not provide specifics on the regulations he plans to roll back.
