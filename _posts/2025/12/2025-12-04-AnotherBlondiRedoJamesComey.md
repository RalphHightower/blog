## [With James Comey possibly facing a new indictment, statute of limitations could be at play](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/james-comey-new-indictment-statute-limitations-halligan-trump)

*A judge’s dismissal of the former [FBI](https://www.justice.gov/) director’s indictment left open the possibility of charging him again but noted a timing issue that could thwart a second indictment.*

Dec. 3, 2025, 6:00 AM EST
By [Jordan Rubin](https://www.ms.now/author/jordan-rubin)

The [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) [reportedly is considering](https://www.ms.now/ana-cabrera-reports/watch/doj-considers-seeking-new-james-comey-indictment-source-2472166979851) seeking a new indictment against [James Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey), whose case was [dismissed last week](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/james-comey-james-indictments-dismissed-lindsey-halligan-unlawfully-appointed) by a judge who said the prosecutor who brought the charges, [Lindsey Halligan](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/comey-case-lindsey-halligan-new-york-post-rcna244956), was unlawfully appointed. The judge’s dismissal was “without prejudice,” meaning it wasn’t a permanent dismissal. It left open the possibility of new charges brought by a lawful prosecutor.

But if the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) secures another indictment against the former [FBI](https://www.justice.gov/) director, that might only resume the tough time the prosecution [was already having](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/halligan-james-comey-trump-indict-first-investigate-second-rcna242185), even aside from the appointment issue. [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) had several pending pretrial motions that were unresolved at the point of the dismissal. Among them was his claim that the [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-demanded charges, secured by a former personal lawyer of the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s without prior prosecutorial experience, were [unconstitutionally vindictive](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/lindsey-halligan-stalking-horse-trump-james-comey-rcna243096).

On top of that issue and others, if [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) were to face a new indictment, then his lawyers could argue that the charges are barred by the statute of limitations, which [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) barely beat when she obtained the indictment in September (over the objection of career prosecutors).

The timing issue surfaced in part of [U.S. District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie’s ruling](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.582136/gov.uscourts.vaed.582136.213.0_3.pdf) that dismissed [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey)’s indictment on the grounds of unlawful appointment. It came up when the judge rejected [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/)’s attempt to retroactively salvage [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/)’s appointment in October. [Currie](https://www.scd.uscourts.gov/Judges/distjudge.asp) wrote that [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/)’s bid was too late because the statute of limitations to charge [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) with lying in his 2020 Senate testimony had expired in September. In a footnote, the judge observed that, as a general matter, indictments pause the statute of limitations, but not if they’re invalid to begin with.

The [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) had argued that [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) could have personally obtained a new indictment under a federal law that gives prosecutors six months to refile dismissed charges, so her ratification of [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey)’s existing indictment was therefore proper. [Currie](https://www.scd.uscourts.gov/Judges/distjudge.asp) rejected that argument because that law applies when a case is dismissed, while [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey)’s indictment was still pending when [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) made her move.

Yet now that the case has been dismissed and the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) is reportedly considering charging [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) again, [that federal law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3288) – [18 U.S Code 3288](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title18-section3288&num=0&edition=prelim) – could come into play in litigation over the statute of limitations if he is charged anew.

The law gives prosecutors six months to bring new charges when a felony indictment is dismissed “for any reason after the period prescribed by the applicable statute of limitations has expired.” During litigation ahead of [Currie](https://www.scd.uscourts.gov/Judges/distjudge.asp)’s ruling on the appointment issue, prosecutors highlighted that language – emphasizing “any reason,” which, [the [DOJ argued](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.582136/gov.uscourts.vaed.582136.137.0_4.pdf), “obviously includes a defective appointment.”

On the other hand, in addition to arguing there was no valid indictment in the first place, [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey)’s lawyers have cited another part of that same law that they said should bar a new indictment. It says that new indictments aren’t allowed “where the reason for the dismissal was the failure to file the indictment … within the period prescribed by the applicable statute of limitations, or some other reason that would bar a new prosecution.”

They highlighted the “some other reason that would bar a new prosecution” language [to argue that](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.582135/gov.uscourts.vaed.582135.175.0.pdf) a new indictment would be barred here, writing: “Using an illegal appointment to procure an indictment days before the statute of limitations expires … is precisely the type of ‘reason’ that must ‘bar a new prosecution.’”

So, if [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) is charged again, the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) would argue that the law plainly gives the prosecution more time, while he would argue that time has already run out because it’s as if the [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/)-secured indictment never existed and it would be unfair to give prosecutors what amounts to an end-run around the statute of limitations.

The challenge [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) could face is that the law itself might provide for such an end-run. But the issue would need to be litigated more fully by the parties and decided by a judge examining it directly – if a new indictment comes.

If it does, then the statute of limitations is just one issue on top of the existing unresolved claims that [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) had raised prior to the dismissal, saying nothing of the hurdle that the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) would face in proving the case beyond a reasonable doubt at trial, if the case made it that far. And unless the government succeeds in pressing its promised appeal of [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/)’s disqualification, reviving the case would require the normally simple step of getting past a grand jury, something that [has proved difficult](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/sidney-reid-not-guilty-verdict-ice-trump-doj-rcna238137) for the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) in political cases.

[Judge Currie](https://www.scd.uscourts.gov/Judges/distjudge.asp) also [dismissed the indictment](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.583341/gov.uscourts.vaed.583341.140.0_1.pdf) [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) brought against [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) [Attorney General](https://ag.ny.gov/) [Letitia James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james), which wouldn’t face the same statute of limitations argument if she’s charged again – though, like [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey), she had raised [other unresolved pretrial arguments](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/letitia-james-outrageous-government-conduct-motion-dismiss-rcna244607) at the time of her dismissal that the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) would need to defeat to move a new case forward against her.
