## [DOJ sues Georgia county in pursuit of 2020 conspiracy theory](https://www.ms.now/news/trump-georgia-lawsuit-doj-2020-election-fulton-county)

_[Fulton County](https://www.fultoncountyga.gov/) has been a flashpoint of [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s misguided preoccupation with the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf) for years._

Dec. 12, 2025, 5:51 PM EST
By [Sydney Carruth](https://www.ms.now/author/sydney-carruth)

The [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) announced Friday that it is suing [Fulton County](https://www.fultoncountyga.gov/), [Georgia](https://www.georgia.gov/), to obtain ballots and other voting records [related to the 2020 general election](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-four-additional-states-and-one-locality-failure-comply-federal), marking an expansion of [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [push to find evidence](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-claims-he-can-produce-evidence-to-bolster-his-2020-election-conspiracy-theories) to substantiate his false claims of widespread voter fraud in the election he lost five years ago. 

Those [claims](https://sos.ga.gov/news/state-election-board-clears-fulton-county-ballot-suitcase-investigation-report-finds-no) have [been](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2103619118) exhaustively [investigated](https://www.npr.org/2021/01/04/953321408/georgia-election-official-dont-let-misinformation-suppress-your-own-vote), [litigated](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/court-cases/adams-v-fulton-county-board-elections-and-registration) and [disproven](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-false-claims-georgias-2020-election-long-debunked/story?id=102377670) since [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his allies attempted to submit fake slates of electors in seven battleground states — [Georgia](https://www.georgia.gov/) among them — in an illegal attempt to undermine the results of the [2020 election](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-four-additional-states-and-one-locality-failure-comply-federal). 

The [lawsuit](https://www.justice.gov/crt/media/1420721/dl?), filed in the northern district of [Georgia](https://www.georgia.gov/) by Assistant [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) for [Civil Rights](https://www.justice.gov/crt) [Harmeet Dhillon](https://www.ms.now/opinion/harmeet-dhillon-doj-civil-rights-division-letter-former-employees), cites “the [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/)’s investigation into [Fulton County](https://www.fultoncountyga.gov/)’s compliance with federal election law.” 

The department is demanding that local election officials hand over “all used and void ballots, stubs of all ballots, signature envelopes, and corresponding envelope digital files from the [2020 General Election](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-four-additional-states-and-one-locality-failure-comply-federal) in [Fulton County](https://www.fultoncountyga.gov/).”  

The north-central [Georgia](https://www.georgia.gov/) county, which encompasses parts of [Atlanta](https://www.atlanta.gov/), has been a flashpoint for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s election conspiracies since his loss in the [2020 general election](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-four-additional-states-and-one-locality-failure-comply-federal) made him the first [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [presidential](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) candidate to lose there since 1992.  

Friday’s legal action comes in the wake of [the dismissal](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-georgia-election-case-dismissal-fani-willis-new-prosecutor) of a high-profile criminal case against [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), former [New York](https://www.nyc.gov/) mayor and [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) attorney Rudy Giuliani and more than a dozen co-conspirators for allegedly conspiring to overturn the results of the [2020 election](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-four-additional-states-and-one-locality-failure-comply-federal) in [Georgia](https://www.georgia.gov/). It was the last criminal case against [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to be dropped after his return to the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) in January. 

The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has been ratcheting up the pressure on his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) to focus the power of the state on substantiating his conspiracy theories around the [2020 election](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-four-additional-states-and-one-locality-failure-comply-federal). [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [installed Kurt Olsen,](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-house-hires-another-stop-steal-lawyer-failure-inevitable-rcna238712), a lawyer and vocal election denier, as a “special government employee” tasked with investigating the [2020 election](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-four-additional-states-and-one-locality-failure-comply-federal) in late October. 

[Georgia](https://www.georgia.gov/)’s [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)-controlled [State Election Board](https://sos.ga.gov/state-election-board) [voted this summer](https://sos.ga.gov/sites/default/files/2025-09/seb_july_29-30_2025_seb_meeting_summary_of_minutes.pdf) to resurrect a probe into claims of voter fraud in [Fulton County](https://www.fultoncountyga.gov/), [calling on the Justice Department](https://sos.ga.gov/sites/default/files/2025-09/seb_july_29-30_2025_seb_meeting_summary_of_minutes.pdf) to help “effect compliance with voting transparency,” according to Friday’s suit. 

The [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) attempted to secure the ballots in October but was denied access by [Fulton County](https://www.fultoncountyga.gov/) [Superior Court Clerk](http://www.fultonsuperiorcourtga.gov/home) Ché Alexander, who is cited in the lawsuit, who said the election records are sealed and can’t be turned over without a court order. 

[Dhillon](https://www.justice.gov/crt/staff-profile/assistant-attorney-general) argued in the lawsuit that by refusing to produce the sealed documents, Alexander violated the record retention requirements in the [Civil Rights Act of 1960](https://www.congress.gov/bill/86th-congress/house-bill/8601/text).

The [Fulton County](https://www.fultoncountyga.gov/) [Board of Elections](https://www.fultoncountyga.gov/Inside-Fulton-County/Fulton-County-Departments/Registration-and-Elections/Registration-and-Elections-Board) and [Georgia](https://www.georgia.gov/) [State Election Board](https://sos.ga.gov/state-election-board) did not immediately respond to [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/)’s request for comment.

In addition to suing [Fulton County](https://www.fultoncountyga.gov/), [Dhillon](https://www.justice.gov/crt/staff-profile/assistant-attorney-general) sued four other states on Friday as part of the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/)’s campaign to access sensitive voter registration lists in states [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) lost in 2020, bringing the total such lawsuits to 18. 

In response to the suits, 10 [Democratic secretaries of state wrote](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/newsRoom/pressReleases/2025/20251118SOSLetterVoterData.pdf) wrote to [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) and [Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/) [Secretary Kristi Noem](https://www.dhs.gov/kristi-noem/) to express their “immense concern” over the request for state voter lists, citing concerns that the data could be shared with [DHS](https://www.dhs.gov/) without their knowledge. 

“We are deeply concerned about the inconsistent and misleading information that Secretaries have received from the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) and [DHS](https://www.dhs.gov/) and with the potential lack of compliance with federal law,” they wrote.
