## [FBI officials at odds over ‘seditious conspiracy’ probe of Democratic veterans](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/fbi-officials-at-odds-over-seditious-conspiracy-probe-of-democratic-veterans)

*[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his team aren’t done going after [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) lawmakers who told troops to refuse illegal orders.*

Dec. 4, 2025, 3:32 PM EST
By [Steve Benen](https://www.ms.now/author/steve-benen)

A couple of weeks ago, after several [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) military veterans urged service members to [reject illegal orders](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-house-targets-democratic-veterans-told-troops-refuse-illegal-ord-rcna244954), the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) began a furious pushback campaign that was extreme, even by contemporary standards. [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [helped lead the charge](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/old-days-was-death-trump-rages-democratic-military-veterans-rcna245165), insisting that the [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) lawmakers, who’d done nothing wrong, had engaged in “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”

The story has faded in recent days — [allegations of war crimes](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-admin-changes-its-story-confirms-second-strike-on-civilian-boat-in-the-caribbean) seem to have taken some of the wind out of the partisans’ sails — but the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) is still pursuing the matter on multiple fronts.

At the [Pentagon](https://www.jcs.mil/), for example, [Defense](https://www.defense.gov/) [Secretary Pete Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) [continues to target](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/the-disturbing-precursor-to-team-trumps-offensive-against-sen-mark-kelly) [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Mark Kelly (D-AZ)](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/) with tactics that [even some congressional Republicans have denounced](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/as-pete-hegseth-advances-retaliatory-investigation-mark-kelly-picks-up-gop-backing). Meanwhile, at the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) used his social media platform earlier this week to [press](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115647333846814832) for [investigations](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115642722629712717) into his political foes.

But of particular interest are the developments within federal law enforcement.

[MS NOW reported](https://www.ms.now/news/trump-doj-fbi-mark-kelly-elissa-slotkin-video-illegal-orders-military) last week that [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) and [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) officials had contacted the [U.S. Capitol Police](https://www.uscp.gov/) to arrange interviews with the six [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) lawmakers in question, each of whom confirmed that they’d been contacted by the [House](https://www.house.gov/) and [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/,) sergeants at arms on behalf of the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/).

[Bloomberg Law](https://pro.bloomberglaw.com/), citing three sources familiar with the situation, [reported that FBI leaders](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/fbi-seeks-seditious-conspiracy-probe-of-democratic-lawmakers) are “pressuring the bureau’s domestic terrorism agents to open a seditious conspiracy investigation” into the [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)s who urged service members to follow the law. Those efforts, however, are running into an important snag. From the report:

> *Career leaders at the bureau’s [Washington Field Office](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/washingtondc) have thus far pushed back on the request for a formal investigation, which would follow [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s call for a trial into the [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/)’ ‘seditious behavior,’ the people familiar said. The [Washington office](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/washingtondc) supervisors cited a lack of legal and factual basis to initiate a criminal case against the [senators](https://www.senate.gov/) and [House members](https://www.house.gov/) who posted a video Nov. 18 reminding service members and the intelligence community of their rights to ‘refuse illegal orders.’*

According to the [Bloomberg](https://pro.bloomberglaw.com/) report, which has not been independently verified by [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/), [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) leaders want an investigation, while the bureau’s domestic terrorism agents have pointed to the inconvenient reality that there’s no reason to launch such an investigation.

The same report added, “[FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) headquarters requested that the investigation arise under the rarely invoked seditious conspiracy statute that [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) used to convict a small number of Oath Keepers and Proud Boys leaders for organizing the Jan. 6 insurrection at the US Capitol.” (The [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) didn’t respond to [Bloomberg](https://pro.bloomberglaw.com/)’s request for comment.)

If true, the report suggests [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) leaders are pushing a truly bonkers approach, equating lawmakers’ expression of support for the rule of law with the actions of insurrectionists who attacked their own country’s democracy.

In light of this report, it’s worth emphasizing that several officials have been [purged from the FBI](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/fbi-agents-association-kash-patel-disregarded-law-latest-personnel-pur-rcna241928) in recent months after they were deemed insufficiently loyal to a [Trumpian](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) agenda.
