## [National Guard shooting becomes the latest failed leadership test for Trump](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/national-guard-shooting-becomes-the-latest-failed-leadership-test-for-trump)

*The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) could have emphasized national unity in the wake of the deadly violence. He did the opposite — again.*

Dec. 1, 2025, 2:35 PM EST
By [Steve Benen](https://www.ms.now/author/steve-benen)

The [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/)’ [David French noted](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/opinion/donald-trump-second-term-israel-ukraine.html) noted earlier this year that [Donald Trump](https://www.ms.now/white-house) “is at his absolute worst in a crisis.” The columnist, whose observation was related to foreign policy, added in reference to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/): “He is not a man who is ready to meet important and dangerous moments.”

The assessment came to mind after the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) seized on the [shooting of two National Guard members](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/following-national-guard-shooting-trump-vows-to-denaturalize-migrants) in [Washington](https://dc.gov/) last week. The [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/)’s [Karen Tumulty](https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/karen-tumulty/) [explained in an analysis](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/30/trump-response-national-guard-attack/):

> *There was a time, not that far in the past, when a shocking tragedy would bring the country together.*

Americans had the capacity to grieve as one — as they did, for instance, in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. This reflected their sense of a common purpose and shared values, whatever their political differences might be.

So far, almost the opposite is happening after two young [National Guard](https://www.nationalguard.mil/) members from [West Virginia](https://www.wv.gov/) were ambushed, killing one and leaving the other in critical condition.

It’s not that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) failed in his efforts to bring people together in the wake of tragic violence; rather, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) didn’t even try. By all appearances, it didn’t even occur to him to try.

Immediately after the attack, which claimed the life of [U.S. Army](https://www.army.mil/) Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) did what many expected him to do: He [blamed Joe Biden](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-national-guard-shooting-washington-november-26-2025/) while lashing out at [immigrants, refugees and asylum-seekers](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-thanksgiving-videoconference-servicemembers-november-27-2025).

This [keeps happening](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/wildfires-crisis-continues-trump-targets-californias-governor-rcna186884). When there was a deadly hurricane in [North Carolina](https://www.nc.gov=), [he flunked a leadership test](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/nc-trump-takes-chance-pretending-fema-lies-are-true-rcna176544). When there was a deadly attack in [New Orleans](https://www.nola.gov/), [he flunked again](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-reaction-new-orleans-attack-went-bad-worse-rcna186109). When responding to deadly fires in [California](https:///www.ca.gov/), [he flunked again](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/wildfires-crisis-continues-trump-targets-californias-governor-rcna186884). In the wake of the [Flight 5342](https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/Pages/DCA25MA108.aspx) crash over the Potomac River, [he flunked again](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-rails-dei-response-deadly-american-airlines-army-helicopter-cras-rcna190024). In the wake of politically motivated violence in [Minnesota](https://www.mn.gov/) in June, [he flunked again](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-tim-walz-call-minnesota-shooting-rcna213450). In the wake of the shooting that killed conservative activist [Charlie Kirk](https://www.charliekurk.com/), [he flunked again](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/remarks-charlie-kirks-death-trump-flunks-yet-another-leadership-test-rcna230551).

What Americans keep confronting is a core truth about who the incumbent [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is and how he approaches his responsibilities: [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) sees crises as opportunities to air grievances and divide the country. To expect him to change is folly.
