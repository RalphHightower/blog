## [Delay still plagues Aileen Cannon’s handling of Trump’s classified documents case](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/aileen-cannon-trump-classified-documents-case-report)

*Even after dismissing his criminal case on dubious grounds, the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-appointed judge is still helping the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).*

Dec. 23, 2025, 2:10 PM EST
By [Jordan Rubin](https://www.ms.now/author/jordan-rubin)

While [congressional](https://www.congress.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) prevent [Jack Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) [from testifying publicly](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jack-smith-isnt-done-pressing-jim-jordan-for-the-transparency-the-gop-doesnt-want) about his work as special counsel investigating and prosecuting [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), the latest action from [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-appointed [Judge Aileen Cannon](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/jack-smith-classified-documents-florida-aileen-cannon-rcna240017) will also keep [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith)’s report on the classified documents case from the public.

To recap how we got here, [Cannon](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/content/judge-aileen-m-cannon) [dismissed](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/cannon-nixon-trump-case-dismissed-rcna161936) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s documents indictment in July 2024 on the grounds that [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) had been unlawfully appointed. [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) appealed [Cannon](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/content/judge-aileen-m-cannon)’s dismissal but [withdrew that appeal](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/jack-smith-drops-appeal-trump-classified-docs-case-rcna181687) after [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) won the [2024 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/2024presgeresults.pdf), citing the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/)’s policy against prosecuting sitting [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)s.

But [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) still had two co-defendants in the appeal, which [Cannon](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/content/judge-aileen-m-cannon) cited in [blocking the release](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/judge-cannon-blocks-trump-classified-documents-report-congress-rcna188534) of [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith)’s report on the case. “In short, the [Department](https://www.justice.gov/) offers no valid justification for the purportedly urgent desire to release to members of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) case information in an ongoing criminal proceeding,” she wrote in her [Jan. 21 order](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.648653/gov.uscourts.flsd.648653.714.0_1.pdf). The [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) under the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) then [dropped the appeal](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-classified-documents-nauta-de-oliveira-doj-rcna189819) against the co-defendants later that month, and the appeals court granted the motion to dismiss in February.

One might have thought that the full dismissal would lead [Cannon](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/content/judge-aileen-m-cannon) to lift her order blocking the release of [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith)’s report. One would’ve been wrong.

Two outside groups, [American Oversight](https://americanoversight.org/) and the [Knight First Amendment Institute](https://knightcolumbia.org/), moved to intervene in the case to get the report released. But [Cannon](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/content/judge-aileen-m-cannon) was taking so long to decide their motions that an appellate panel last month [chided the Trump appointee](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/judge-cannon-jack-smith-report-trump-undue-delay-rcna241707) for “undue delay,” while giving her two more months to finally rule.

It’s against the press of that impending court-ordered deadline that the [Florida judge](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/)’s actions came this week — again favorable to the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) side. She [denied the motions](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.648653/gov.uscourts.flsd.648653.760.0_1.pdf) from [American Oversight](https://americanoversight.org/) and the [Knight First Amendment Institute](https://knightcolumbia.org/) to intervene to lift her January order. And she acknowledged that the complete dismissal of the documents case undercut the rationale of her January order, but she still [set its expiration](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.648653/gov.uscourts.flsd.648653.761.0.pdf) for two months from now – to Feb. 24 – citing [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his former co-defendants’ request for at least 60 days to let them “seek appropriate relief from this Court.”

What, you might wonder, could that “appropriate relief” be, if the rationale of [Cannon](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/content/judge-aileen-m-cannon)’s January order has evaporated? One thing she noted in her latest order is that the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) side has argued that the report shouldn’t be released because it’s the product of (what [Cannon](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/content/judge-aileen-m-cannon) deemed) an illegally appointed special counsel and that it contains other privileged and protected information.

At any rate, as things stand now, [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith)’s report will stay secret until Feb. 24. And there’s reason to think it will stay secret longer after that.

The [Knight First Amendment Institute](https://knightcolumbia.org/) [said it intends to appeal](https://knightcolumbia.org/content/judge-blocks-release-of-special-counsels-report-in-trump-classified-documents-case) [Cannon](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/content/judge-aileen-m-cannon)’s ruling. In response to my question of what would happen if her order takes effect Feb. 24, the institute’s senior counsel, [Scott Wilkens](https://knightcolumbia.org/bios/view/-10), said [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) “will in theory be free to release the report,” but that because the government “has already made clear that it won’t release the report voluntarily, we will file suit under FOIA [the Freedom of Information Act] to compel it to do so.”

Even so, [Wilkens](https://knightcolumbia.org/bios/view/-10) said he thinks it’s unlikely that [Cannon](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/content/judge-aileen-m-cannon)’s injunction blocking the report’s release will expire on Feb. 24, because, he said, “[DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) and the defendants will no doubt seek to keep the injunction in place, and [Judge Cannon](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/content/judge-aileen-m-cannon) may well grant their request.”

[Cannon](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/content/judge-aileen-m-cannon)’s latest action comes as former [CIA](https://www.cia.gov/) Director John Brennan [seeks to avoid](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/22/us/politics/trump-doj-investigation-judge-cannon-brennan-cia.html) her presiding over any [Trump-backed retribution](https://www.ms.now/news/doj-preparing-subpoenas-investigation-john-brennan-rcna242338) against him. The [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) reported on a https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/aileen-cannon-trump-classified-documents-case-report to the [Southern District of Florida](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/)’s chief judge from Brennan’s counsel, which listed “numerous past decisions by [Judge Cannon](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/content/judge-aileen-m-cannon) that could reasonably cause the prosecutors to believe that hers would be an accommodating courtroom for an investigation and possible prosecution of [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s perceived political adversaries.”

Among the decisions listed in the letter is her handling of the litigation over the release of [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith)’s report.
