*Ben Shapiro and [Tucker Carlson](https://tuckercarlson.com/) traded barbs onstage as the [MAGA](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) coalition splintered at [Turning Point USA](https://tpusa.com/)’s flagship event.*

PHOENIX — [Turning Point USA](https://tpusa.com/)’s flagship event, [AmericaFest](https://www.amfest.com/), devolved into a verbal food fight on Thursday evening as two right-wing titans traded salvos onstage and revealed a bitter divide in [MAGA](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) world.

Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro came out swinging, spending much of his half-hour speech laying into far-right influencers like [Nick Fuentes](https://nicholasjfuentes.com/) and [Candace Owens](https://www.candaceowens.com/), describing their rhetoric as increasingly antisemitic and conspiratorial in the wake of [Charlie Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/)’s shooting death in September.

In a more surprising turn, Shapiro chastised the man who would take the stage after him, [Tucker Carlson](https://tuckercarlson.com/), for hosting [Fuentes](https://nicholasjfuentes.com/) on his podcast last month and platforming a man former [Vice President Mike Pence](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/people/mike-pence/) once described as [“a white nationalist, an antisemite and Holocaust denier.”](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-defends-tucker-carlson-after-interview-with-nick-fuentes-far-right-activist-known-for-his-antisemitic-views)

“There is a reason that [Charlie Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) despised [Nick Fuentes](https://nicholasjfuentes.com/),” Shapiro said. “He knew that [Nick Fuentes](https://nicholasjfuentes.com/) is an evil troll and that building him up is an act of moral imbecility, and that is precisely what [Tucker Carlson](https://tuckercarlson.com/) did.”

Shapiro dug further into [Carlson](https://tuckercarlson.com/):

“He built [Nick Fuentes](https://nicholasjfuentes.com/) up, and he ought to take responsibility for that.” 

[Carlson](https://tuckercarlson.com/) wasn’t the only AmericaFest speaker caught in Shapiro’s sights. The 41-year-old co-founder of [The Daily Wire](https://www.dailywire.com/) also unloaded on former [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) strategist [Steve Bannon](https://warroom.org/) over his recent rhetoric surrounding Israel.

“When [Steve Bannon](https://warroom.org/), for example, accuses his foreign policy opponents of loyalty to a foreign country, he’s not actually making an argument based on evidence,” Shapiro said, following up with an allegation over [Bannon](https://warroom.org/)’s ties to Jeffrey Epstein.

“He’s simply maligning people that he disagrees with, which is indeed par for the course from a man who was once a P.R. flack for Jeffrey Epstein,” Shapiro said, without clarifying the claim.

New photos released by [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) on Thursday show [Bannon and Epstein sitting across from each other at a desk](https://www.ms.now/news/house-democrats-release-new-jeffrey-epstein-photos-donald-trump). 

[Carlson](https://tuckercarlson.com/), who took the stage shortly after Shapiro, refused to invoke his new nemesis by name. Instead, he chided Shapiro for criticizing him at an event known for its free-speech ethos.

“I laughed that kind of bitter, sardonic laugh that emerges from you in like, upside-down world,” [Carlson](https://tuckercarlson.com/) said of Shapiro’s speech. “It’s not supposed to work this way, to hear calls for de-platforming and denouncing people at a [Charlie Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) event.”

[Carlson](https://tuckercarlson.com/) spent some of his speech defending against Shapiro’s allegations of antisemitism.

“Antisemitism is immoral. In my religion, it is immoral to hate people for how they were born. Period,” [Carlson](https://tuckercarlson.com/) said.

He then tried to downplay the existence of the [MAGA](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) infighting that Shapiro laid bare minutes before.

“The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) coalition, and the supposed civil war going on within that group — I don’t think it’s real,” he said. “I think it’s fake. I think it’s totally fake.”

But the drama in [MAGA](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) world appears to be ramping up. In the moments after their speeches, [Owens](https://www.candaceowens.com/) took to X to [reaffirm her baseless claims](https://www.ms.now/news/americafest-turning-point-charlie-kirk) that [Israel](https://www.gov.il/) was somehow involved in [Charlie Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/)’s killing.

She [posted](https://x.com/RealCandaceO/status/2001826552070447587?s=20): “Every time Ben speaks I feel more certain [Israel](https://www.gov.il/) is involved.”
