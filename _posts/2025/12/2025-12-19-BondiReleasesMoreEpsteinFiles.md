## [Justice Department releases more Epstein files under congressional deadline](https://www.ms.now/news/justice-department-releases-epstein-files-investigation)

*Not all of the documents were released as required by [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/). The department said it would release “several hundred thousand more” documents over the next couple of weeks.*

Dec. 19, 2025, 4:04 PM EST
By [Clarissa-Jan Lim](https://www.ms.now/author/clarissa-jan-lim) and [Julianne McShane](https://www.ms.now/author/julianne-mcshane)

The [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) on Friday released a trove of documents related to multiple years of investigations into Jeffrey Epstein, the first of a series of disclosures that [Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche](https://www.justice.gov/dag/) said will continue on a rolling basis — contrary to the law [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) passed and [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) signed that mandates the full release of “all unclassified records” by Dec. 19.

While the full scope of the release won’t be clear for many hours — or even days — it was already clear Friday that the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) was initially deficient in another aspect of the [Epstein Files Transparency Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/4405): searchability. The search function did appear to have improved later Friday evening.

The law enacted on Nov. 19 requires the files to be made “publicly available in a searchable and downloadable format.” The significantly redacted files released Friday, however, don’t appear fully searchable, and many of the thousands of documents appear to be among those already made public.

A team of [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/) reporters and editors were reviewing the documents Friday evening. They include photos of Epstein with powerful people: a previously released framed picture of Epstein and his co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell, posing alongside [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and first lady [Melania Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/melania-trump/), as well as images of Epstein posing with people whose identities have been redacted, including some who appear to be young girls. Documents include lists of employees at Epstein’s homes and notes from law enforcement interviews with victims.

Former [President Bill Clinton](https://www.clintonlibrary.gov/) appears in several of the photos released Friday, alongside Epstein, Maxwell and redacted persons. In one image, he appears with a redacted woman sitting on his lap; in another, he is with a redacted person in a jacuzzi. In another picture, [Clinton](https://www.clintonlibrary.gov/) poses alongside the singers Michael Jackson and Diana Ross, as well as others whose faces are blacked out. No information was provided as to the context for the photos, including when or where they were taken.

Angel Ureña, deputy chief of staff for [Clinton](https://www.clintonlibrary.gov/), [accused](https://x.com/angelurena/status/2002159039183269993) the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) in a statement released on X on Friday night of “shielding themselves from what comes next, or from what they’ll try and hide forever.” 

“So they can release as many grainy 20-plus-year-old photos as they want, but this isn’t about [Bill Clinton](https://www.clintonlibrary.gov/),” he continued. “Never has, never will be.”

“Even [Susie Wiles](https://www.linkedin.com/in/susiewiles/) said [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was wrong about [Bill Clinton](https://www.clintonlibrary.gov/),” Ureña added, seemingly referring to the bombshell [Vanity Fair article](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/trump-susie-wiles-interview-exclusive-part-1?_sp=df6d4f3c-3cfc-4b4a-9ba9-f5b64545fa8a.1765891878879) published this week, in which [Wiles](https://www.linkedin.com/in/susiewiles/), the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) chief of staff, [said](https://www.ms.now/news/key-takeaways-from-susie-wiles-interviews-with-vanity-fair) there was nothing incriminating about [Clinton](https://www.clintonlibrary.gov/) in the files.

In a letter to members of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) to explain the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/)’s process, [Blanche](https://www.justice.gov/dag/) [said](https://x.com/dagtoddblanche/status/2002136486297149937?s=46) some materials are still in the “final stages of review” and estimated that it would be completed “over the next two weeks.” He said the partial release was “consistent with the law and with protections for victims.”

Members of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) [slammed the Justice Department](https://www.ms.now/news/democrats-slam-trump-administration-incomplete-epstein-files) on Friday evening for not releasing all the files by the midnight deadline.

[Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Ro Khanna (D-CA17)](https://khanna.house.gov/), who co-sponsored the [Epstein Files Transparency Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/4405), demanded the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) provide “a clear timeline of when the rest of the documents will be released, and an explanation for why they did not release all of them today.”

[Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) Majority Leader [Chuck Schumer (D-NY)](https://www.schumer.senate.gov/), said in a statement Friday, “Simply releasing a mountain of blacked out pages violates the spirit of transparency and the letter of the law. … [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)s are working to assess the documents that have been released to determine what actions must be taken to hold the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) accountable.”

The release marks a significant concession from the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) and the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) himself, who fought against the release of the files and went so far as to tell [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) to move on from what he deemed a “[hoax](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/18/house-epstein-bill-justice-department/)” by [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)s to divert focus from the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s agenda.

The [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/)’s action came under strong pressure from congressional [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/), who sided with [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) to force a vote in the [House](https://www.house.gov/) to pass legislation that was then [overwhelmingly adopted](https://www.ms.now/news/senate-passes-epstein-bill-rcna244723) by the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/).

The legislation states that redactions in the files must be justified in writing, published in the [Federal Register](https://www.archives.gov/federal-register) and submitted to [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/). [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) is also required to submit a report to the [House Judiciary Committee](https://judiciary.house.gov/) and [Senate Judiciary Committee](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/) within 15 days that includes “categories of records released and withheld,” a summary of redactions made by the agency and an unredacted list of government officials and “politically exposed persons named or referenced” in the files.

In response to a [post on X](https://x.com/RepThomasMassie/status/2002175357277921449) from [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Thomas Massie (T-KY4)](https://massie.house.gov/), critiquing the redactions, a [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) spokesperson [wrote](https://x.com/dojspox47/status/2002181996605325447?s=46), “No Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) were redacted from today’s released Epstein documents. All references to PEPs were disclosed in full.”

It remains to be seen whether the release of the material will quiet the clamor for more information on Epstein, a convicted sex offender who died in a [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) jail cell in 2019. Authorites ruled his death a suicide. Stoked by conspiracy theories from [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) allies, that base has long demanded the names of powerful men they believe may have abused underage girls.

[Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.ms.now/news/senate-democrats-threaten-to-sue-trump-doj-over-epstein-files) sparked a furor in July when she issued a memo declaring the case essentially closed, saying there was no list of Epstein’s clients despite having [previously claimed otherwise](https://thehill.com/homenews/5158153-jeffrey-epstein-client-list-bondi-review/).

Maxwell was [sentenced](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/ghislaine-maxwell-sentenced-20-years-prison-conspiring-jeffrey-epstein-sexually-abuse) in 2022 to 20 years in prison for conspiring to sexually abuse minors. After an [unusual interview](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/ghislaine-maxwell-todd-blanche-doj-transcripts-audio-rcna226676) with [Blanche](https://www.justice.gov/dag/) in July, Maxwell was [moved](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/ghislaine-maxwell-moved-lower-security-facility-texas-rcna222516) from a low-security [Florida prison](https://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/tal/) to a minimum-security federal prison camp in [Texas](https://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/bry/). In the interview, Maxwell [said](https://www.justice.gov/storage/audio-files/Interview%20Transcript/Interview%20Transcript%20-%20Maxwell%202025.07.24%20(Redacted).pdf) of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) that she “never saw the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) in any type of massage setting” and “never witnessed the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) in any appropriate setting in any way.”

“The [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) was never inappropriate with anybody,” Maxwell added. “In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects.”

This week, Maxwell [made](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/12/17/politics/maxwell-habeas-corpus-petition) another long-shot bid to get a federal court to turn to overturn her conviction after the [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) [declined](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/ghislaine-maxwell-appeal-supreme-court-epstein-trump-rcna235391) to review her appeal in October.

The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) framed the release as a win for Epstein’s victims.

“By releasing thousands of pages of documents, cooperating with the [House Oversight Committee](https://oversight.house.gov/)’s subpoena request, and [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) recently calling for further investigations into Epstein’s [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) friends, the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [Administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has done more for the victims than [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)s ever have,” [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) spokesperson Abigail Jackson said.

CORRECTION (Dec. 19, 2025, 9:52 p.m.): A previous version of this article indicated incorrectly that singer Diana Ross is dead. She is still alive.
