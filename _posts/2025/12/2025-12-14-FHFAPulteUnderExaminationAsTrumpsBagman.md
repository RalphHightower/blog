[Bill Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte), the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) loyalist who leads the [Federal Housing Finance Agency](https://www.fhfa.gov/), or [FHFA](https://www.fhfa.gov/), sure has been busy lately. The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s embrace of 50-year mortgages? It was [Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte) [who made that happen](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-white-house-throws-support-new-50-year-mortgages-rcna243259). The weaponization of mortgage fraud allegations against the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s perceived political enemies? That was [Pulte’s handiwork, too](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/team-trump-finds-something-new-weaponize-mortgage-fraud-allegations-rcna226381).

But just as notably, the [FHFA](https://www.fhfa.gov/) chief — a [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)ial sycophant [recently described](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/08/07/bill-pulte-trump-powell/) by [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) as “a prominent [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) sidekick” — has taken some provocative moves within the agency he leads.

Earlier this month, the public learned [about the ouster](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/team-trumps-campaign-inspectors-general-goes-bad-worse-rcna241845) of the [FHFA](https://www.fhfa.gov/)’s inspector general, which prompted [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)](https://www.warren.senate.gov/) to respond: “[Director Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte) has some answering to do.”

The inspector general wasn’t alone. A week later, there were related reports that [Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte) [also fired the internal watchdogs](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/11/10/bill-pulte-fannie-mae-firing-ethics/) at the [Federal National Mortgage Association](https://www.fhfa.gov/), better known as [Fannie Mae](https://www.fanniemae.com/). According to [Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte), the employees were dismissed as part of a broader campaign against diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.

That explanation might not have been altogether true. [The Wall Street Journal reported](https://www.wsj.com/finance/regulation/fannie-mae-watchdogs-probed-how-pulte-obtained-mortgage-records-of-key-democrats-07c5cc39?st=s1pWNM&):

> *[Fannie Mae](https://www.fanniemae.com/) watchdogs who were removed from their jobs had been probing if [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) appointee [Bill Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte) had improperly obtained mortgage records of key [Democratic](https:/www.democrats.org/) officials, including [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) [Attorney General](https://ag.ny.gov/) [Letitia James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james), according to people familiar with the matter. [Fannie](https://www.fanniemae.com/)’s ethics and investigations group had received internal complaints alleging senior officials had improperly directed staff to access the mortgage documents of James and others, according to the people.*

According to the [Journal](https://www.wsj.com/)’s account, which has not been independently verified by [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/), [Fannie Mae](https://www.fanniemae.com/)’s internal watchdogs were exploring whether [Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte) had the authority to seek the documents and proper procedures were followed. They proceeded to elevate the matter to the [FHFA](https://www.fhfa.gov/)’s inspector general, who notified the [U.S. attorney’s office in eastern Virginia](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/).

It was around this time when [Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte) fired the inspector general — and the [Fannie Mae](https://www.fanniemae.com/) internal watchdogs.

An [FHFA](https://www.fhfa.gov/) spokesperson denied anything untoward, though I don’t imagine we’ve heard the last of this one. Watch this space.
