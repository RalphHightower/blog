title: "Trump’s America Has Abandoned Longterm Traditional Allies "
---

Back in April, I  noted from various news sources that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com)'s "America First" will leave "America Alone" without allies or partners. It all began with [Donnie](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) trade war with the world. [Canada](https://www.canada.ca/) and [Portugal](https://www.portugal.gov.pt/pt/gc24) are considering canceling their ordersbof F-35 fighter jets.

## [Traditional U.S. allies move further away after seeing Trump’s security strategy](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/traditional-u-s-allies-move-further-away-after-seeing-trumps-security-strategy)

*If the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s goal is to push allies away, and encourage others to leave the U.S. behind, his efforts are right on track.*

Dec. 10, 2025, 3:46 PM EST
By [Steve Benen](https://www.ms.now/author/steve-benen)

Around this time every year, the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) unveils a written [National Security Strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-National-Security-Strategy.pdf), or [NSS](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-National-Security-Strategy.pdf), which is generally released with some fanfare. That’s not surprising. Given the international scrutiny the document receives and the amount of time and care that’s invested in the annual report, [administrations](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) tend to present their [NSS](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-National-Security-Strategy.pdf) with a degree of pride.

Late last week, however, [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) quietly unveiled its new NSS, which generated immediate global attention — and alarm.

The good news is that the unusually brief document, which is [available in its entirety](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-National-Security-Strategy.pdf), is quite readable. While some official foreign policy and national security documents are often inaccessible and filled with jargon, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s new NSS is easy to understand.

The bad news is that the vision sketched out in the document is dreadful. The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and his team envision a near future in which the United States will [withdraw from its role](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/12/08/trump-national-security-strategy-europe-russia/) as the leader of the free world, [promote racial purity in Europe](https://www.ms.now/opinion/trump-national-security-europe-immigration-racial-purity), abandon [intensifying environmental crises](https://bsky.app/profile/rikefranke.bsky.social/post/3m7etslqjts2v) and [de-emphasize democracy abroad](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/05/us/politics/trump-national-security-strategy.html).

(It’s also needlessly propagandistic at times. As [The Bulwark noted](https://www.thebulwark.com/p/trump-national-security-strategy-foreign-policy-defense-allies-china-russia-iran-north-korea), “With 27 instances of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s name in a mere 29 pages of text, it is a strategy document worthy of [North Korea](http://naenara.com.kp/main/index/en/first).”)

The same document [largely ignores Russia](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/07/us/politics/trump-security-strategy-superpowers.html), which helps to explain why the [Kremlin](http://kremlin.ru/) [was so pleased with it](https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-us-security-donald-trump-vladimir-putin-moscow-nato/).

[The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/)’s [Anne Applebaum characterized](https://bsky.app/profile/anneapplebaum.bsky.social/post/3m7ahr34txs2s) characterized the new [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) NSS as “a performative suicide,” adding that it’s “hard to think of another great power ever abdicating its influence so quickly and so publicly.” Applebaum concluded, “It will be worth following the reactions around the world.”

The morning after the document was released, [Donald Tusk](https://www.gov.pl/web/premier/prezes-rady-ministrow---donald-tusk), the prime minister of [Poland](https://www.gov.pl/), [wrote via social media](https://x.com/donaldtusk/status/1997336196007985541), “Dear American friends, [Europe](https://european-union.europa.eu/index_en) is your closest ally, not your problem. And we have common enemies. At least that’s how it has been in the last 80 years. We need to stick to this, this is the only reasonable strategy of our common security. Unless something has changed.”

He didn’t explicitly mention [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s National Security Strategy by name, but given the context, he didn’t have to.

Three days later, [The Associated Press reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/europe/germany-chancellor-friedrich-merz-europe-national-security-strategy-rcna248177):

> *[German](https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de) [Chancellor Friedrich Merz](https://www.friedrich-merz.de/) said the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s new national security strategy underscored the need for [Europe](https://european-union.europa.eu/index_en) to become ‘much more independent’ from the U.S. in terms of security policy. … Parts of the document were understandable, but ‘some of it is unacceptable for us from the [European](https://european-union.europa.eu/index_en) point of view,’ he told reporters in the western [German](https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de) city of [Mainz](https://www.mainz.de/).*

He added that the new U.S. document “confirms my assessment that we in [European](https://european-union.europa.eu/index_en), and so also in [Germany](https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de), must become much more independent from the U.S. in terms of security policy. This is not a surprise, but it has now been confirmed again. It has been documented.”

Responding to the NSS’ promotion of [Europe](https://european-union.europa.eu/index_en)’s more nativist, far-right political parties, [European Council](https://european-union.europa.eu/index_en) [president Antonio Costa](http://www.parlamento.pt/DeputadoGP/Paginas/Biografia.aspx?BID=156) also [warned the U.S.](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-council-antonio-costa-warns-us-against-interference-in-europe/) this week against interfering in [European](https://european-union.europa.eu/index_en) affairs.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has spent the year [offending](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/pursuit-greenland-white-house-wont-take-use-force-table-rcna198936), [outraging](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/canadian-prime-minister-united-states-no-longer-reliable-partner-rcna198560) and [confusing](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/bizarre-remarks-un-trump-embarrasses-united-states-rcna233215) many of our closest traditional allies, going back generations. If the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)’s goal was to push those allies away and to encourage others to forge new alliances while leaving the U.S. behind, his efforts are right on track.
