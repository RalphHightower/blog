## [Why Jim Jordan wanted to keep Jack Smith’s testimony hidden from the public](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jim-jordan-jack-smith-testimony-hidden-public)

*After the hearing, Rep. [Jamie Raskin](https://raskin.house.gov/) said [Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/) “made an excellent decision in not allowing [Jack Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) to testify publicly,” but the comment was a pointed joke.*

Dec. 18, 2025, 11:37 AM EST
By [Steve Benen](https://www.ms.now/author/steve-benen)

When [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) on the [House Judiciary Committee](https://judiciary.house.gov/) opened an investigation into the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/)’s criminal inquiries of [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), the question wasn’t whether members would hear from [former special counsel Jack Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith), but rather, how.

The prosecutor [wanted the hearing to be public](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jack-smith-ready-respond-gop-questions-wants-public-see-answers-rcna239538) so that everyone could see and hear his answers. [Chairman](http://judiciary.house.gov/the-committee/the-chairman) [Jim Jordan (T-OH4)](https://jordan.house.gov/) refused, preferring secrecy to sunlight.

There was no great mystery as to why. [The New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/12/03/us/trump-news/c665b349-d12c-56d9-a879-456e05554314?smid=url-share) a couple of weeks ago that [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s were “reluctant to give [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) a prime public platform out of concern that he could embarrass [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) by making a compelling case for the indictments over the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s attempt to overturn the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf) and his retention of classified documents.”

That is, the point of the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) hearing was to try to trip up the former special counsel, not offer him an opportunity to present compelling evidence and tell inconvenient truths the party prefers to keep from the public.

So although we don’t yet know exactly what the prosecutor said in his closed-door testimony on Wednesday, it quickly became obvious that [Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/)’s motivation for secrecy was well grounded. [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/jack-smith-tells-congress-prove-trump-engaged-criminal-scheme-overturn-rcna249715):

>  *[Former special counsel Jack Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) told a congressional committee Wednesday that his team found ‘proof beyond a reasonable doubt’ that [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) engaged in a ‘criminal scheme’ to overturn the results of the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf), according to parts of his opening statement obtained by [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/).*

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) also ‘repeatedly tried to obstruct justice’ to keep secret his retention of classified documents found during an [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) search of his [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) estate in [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/), [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) told members of the [House Judiciary Committee](https://judiciary.house.gov/) at a closed-door hearing.

[Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) added that he and his team turned up “powerful evidence that showed [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) willfully retained highly classified documents after he left office in Jan. 2021, storing them at [his social club](https://www.maralagoclub.com/), including in a bathroom and a ballroom where events and gatherings took place.”

After the hearing, [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Jamie Raskin (D-MD8)](https://raskin.house.gov/), the top [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) on the [Judiciary Committee](https://judiciary.house.gov/), joked that [Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/) “made an excellent decision in not allowing [Jack Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) to testify publicly, because had he done so, it would have been absolutely devastating to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and all the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s men involved in the insurrectionary activities of [Jan. 6.]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %})”

Whether a transcript of the testimony ever reaches the public remains to be seen.
