## [Jack Smith’s closed-door Q&A with lawmakers creates risks (and opportunities)](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jack-smiths-closed-door-qa-with-lawmakers-creates-risks-and-opportunities)

*To date, no [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) official has produced any evidence that the former special counsel did anything wrong.*

Dec. 17, 2025, 10:31 AM EST
By [Steve Benen](https://www.ms.now/author/steve-benen)

When [House Judiciary Committee](https://judiciary.house.gov/) [Chairman](http://judiciary.house.gov/the-committee/the-chairman) [Jim Jordan (T-OH4)](https://jordan.house.gov/) [sent a letter](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/10/14/congress/jordan-wants-jack-smith-testimony-00607878) to former special counsel [Jack Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) in October, the [Ohio Republican](https://jordan.house.gov/) demanded the prosecutor appear before his panel. [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) responded rather quickly, telling [Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/) that he’d love to answer the committee’s questions — but [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) [wanted the hearing to be public](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jack-smith-ready-respond-gop-questions-wants-public-see-answers-rcna239538) so that everyone could see and hear his answers.

[Jordan refused](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jim-jordan-prefers-secrecy-to-sunlight-when-it-comes-to-his-jack-smith-probe), preferring secrecy to sunlight.

The far-right representative soon after took the next logical step and [subpoenaed](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jim-jordan-prefers-secrecy-to-sunlight-when-it-comes-to-his-jack-smith-probe) the former special counsel. As [The Associated Press reported](https://apnews.com/article/jack-smith-congress-justice-department-d35557d525fcfe51a20d08c6abb7f71d), the closed-door inquiry is finally poised to get underway.

> *Former [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) [special counsel Jack Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) is set for a closed-door interview with [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) on Wednesday after lawmakers rebuffed his offer to testify publicly about his investigations into [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).*

> *The private deposition is part of an ongoing investigation by the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)-led [House Judiciary Committee](https://judiciary.house.gov/) into the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/)’s criminal inquiries of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) during the [Biden administration](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/).*

In case anyone needs a refresher, as 2025 got underway, the then-special counsel [grudgingly stepped down](https://www.ms.now/top-stories/latest/jack-smith-resigns-justice-department-trump-rcna187281) stepped down after the [2024 election results](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/2024presgeresults.pdf) [derailed his criminal cases](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/sen-mike-lee-doesnt-understand-jack-smiths-cases-rcna182012) against [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). As 2025 nears its end, however, the prosecutor remains a popular target for [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/)’ ire.

The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) continues to [peddle baseless attacks](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/january-6-fbi-republican-conspiracy-theory-rcna236367) against the prosecutor; the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) [continues](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/kash-patel-fires-yet-another-group-fbi-agents-cause-shutters-corruptio-rcna236490) to [push out](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/doj-fires-career-prosecutors-team-trumps-revenge-tour-continues-rcna189586?icid=previouspost_bot) officials who worked with him; and assorted [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) voices continue to go after him with [unhinged and easily discredited](https://www.thedailybeast.com/eric-trump-goes-full-tin-full-hat-in-rant-against-his-dads-nemesis/) conspiracy theories.

On Capitol Hill, [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) lawmakers remain eager to treat [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) like a punching bag. [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Michael Rulli (T-OH6)](https://rulli.house.gov/) [recently accused](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3m3uifejwj22a) the prosecutor of acts that he said bordered on “treason”; [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Marsha Blackburn (T-TN)](https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/) [referred Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) to the [Justice Department](https://thehill.com/homenews/5561372-marsha-blackburn-jack-smith-doj-probe/) for a misconduct investigation, based on [misguided allegations](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/us/politics/jack-smith-phone-records-republicans.html) the [Tennessee Republican](https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/) [did not appear to understand](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/january-6-fbi-republican-conspiracy-theory-rcna236367); and several [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) members have even [pushed for Smith’s disbarment](https://www.axios.com/2025/10/17/jack-smith-arctic-frost-marsha-blackburn-letter-doj).

The day before [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith)’s appearance on Capitol Hill, [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Speaker](https://speaker.house.gov/) [Mike Johnson (T-LA4)](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) joined the pile-on.

 “If you’re going to restore the people’s faith in the justice system, you have to show them that there are serious consequences for people like [Jack Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith), who abuses that system,” the [Louisiana Republican](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) told reporters.

The obvious problem with [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/)’s remark is that quite obviously it’s [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), not [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith), [who’s abusing the system](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/one-thing-letitia-james-james-comey-indictments-common-rcna236837). A related but no less important problem: To date, no [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) official has produced any evidence whatsoever of [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) having done anything wrong.

The [House speaker](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) simply asserted that the former special counsel abused the justice system, but the [GOP leader](https://www.gop.com/) bolstered the claim with literally nothing.

As for developments in the [House Judiciary Committee](https://judiciary.house.gov%), [Politico reported](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/17/jack-smith-trump-congress-investigations-00693884) that [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) is in the unenviable position of having to navigate “Byzantine secrecy laws and rules that limit what he can disclose to lawmakers” while [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) look for ways to “trip him up and incriminate him.”

But while there are political risks, there are related opportunities. The same [Politico](https://www.politico.com%) report added that [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) are “eager for further details about the investigations [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) had to abandon after [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) won reelection in 2024.”

[Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Jamie Raskin of (D-MD8)](https://raskin.house.gov/), the top [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) on the [House Judiciary Committee](https://judiciary.house.gov/), said, “We want to hear exactly what he found, and what he did. He just needs to come and tell the truth.”
