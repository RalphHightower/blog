## [Trump's DOJ expected to seek re-indictment of Letitia James](https://www.ms.now/news/prosecutor-indictment-letitia-james-trump)

*The mortgage fraud case was just dismissed on the grounds that [Lindsey Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) was unlawfully appointed to her position — but the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) isn't done yet.*

Federal prosecutors are expected to seek to re-indict [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) [Attorney General](https://ag.ny.gov/) [Letitia James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james) on Thursday in [Norfolk, Va](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/). on charges related to alleged mortgage fraud, according to a source with knowledge of the plans.

Now [Roger Keller](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edmi), a federal assistant U.S. attorney normally based in [Missouri](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edmi), is expected to present information before a grand jury regarding the allegations against James.

The effort comes after [a federal judge last week dismissed the criminal indictments](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/james-comey-james-indictments-dismissed-lindsey-halligan-unlawfully-appointed) of both [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james) and [former FBI Director James Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) on the grounds that [Lindsey Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) was not lawfully appointed to her position as the [acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/), and lacked the authority to prosecute anyone in federal court. But [Judge Cameron McGowan Currie](https://www.scd.uscourts.gov/Judges/distjudge.asp) dismissed the cases without prejudice, meaning the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) [could conceivably bring charges again.](https://www.ms.now/opinion/indictments-dismissed-halligan-comey-james). 

The cases against [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james) and [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) have been plagued with factual and procedural problems since the start.

The same day as [Currie](https://www.scd.uscourts.gov/Judges/distjudge.asp)’s Nov. 24 ruling, [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced that the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) would appeal the ruling, but that has not yet happened. According to multiple sources, top [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) leaders have been debating their strongest path forward and concluded they must seek to re-indict both [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james) and [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey). 

[Currie’s ruling hinted at a possible of statute of limitations issue](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/james-comey-new-indictment-statute-limitations-halligan-trump) with [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey), which could prevent a new indictment. 

But the cases against [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james) and [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) have been plagued with factual and procedural problems since the start. Career prosecutors in the [Eastern District of Virginia](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) concluded that both cases lacked sufficient factual basis to pursue criminal cases. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), who had pressed the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) to charge his two political critics, [threatened to fire the acting U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-forces-uncooperative-us-attorney-virginia-touching-new-scandal-rcna232515) when he resisted seeking both indictments.

In September, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) installed [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/), an insurance lawyer and [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) aide with no prosecutorial experience, as the acting [U.S. attorney. Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) then sought and obtained the indictments of first [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) and then [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james), after first firing a senior supervisory prosecutor in Norfolk who also objected to bringing the case against [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james).
