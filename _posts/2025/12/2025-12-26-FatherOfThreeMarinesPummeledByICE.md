*Indiscriminate deportations are morally destructive in their own right, but especially appalling for a White House that claims to support the military.*

Jun. 25, 2025, 5:11 PM EDT
By [Chris Hayes](https://www.ms.now/author/chris-hayes) and [Allison Detzel](https://www.ms.now/author/allison-detzel)

This is an adapted excerpt from the [June 24](https://www.ms.now/all) episode of [“All In with Chris Hayes.”](https://www.ms.now/author/chris-hayes)

While national attention has moved away from [Los Angeles](https://lacity.gov/), the federal government still has [700 Marines and more than 4,000 National Guard](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/2000-national-guard-troops-duty-l-legal-battle-deployment-continues-rcna213678) troops [stationed there](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/23/los-angeles-trump-troop-deployments) as part of [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and Stephen Miller’s militarized deportation program.

Of course, it is not just [California](https://www.ca.gov/). According to a new analysis from the [libertarian Cato Institute,](https://www.cato.org/blog/ice-arresting-1100-percent-more-noncriminals-streets-2017), [Immigration and Customs Enforcement](https://www.ice.gov/) arrests of migrants with no criminal history are up more than 1,000% when compared to the first year of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s first term.

**Every day, we are seeing stories of immigration enforcement that truly shock the conscience.**

Every day, we are seeing stories of immigration enforcement that truly shock the conscience, as [armed, masked agents](https://www.ms.now/top-stories/latest/trump-immigration-deportation-secret-police-rcna211478) rolling up to regular folks who have not been convicted or even accused of serious crimes— folks who, in many cases, are just trying to do their jobs. Often, these unidentified agents detain them as onlookers cry out for them to stop.

One recent example from the city of [Santa Ana](https://www.santa-ana.org/), [California](https://www.ca.gov/), involved a landscaper named [Narciso Barranco,](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/marine-veteran-defends-immigrant-father-video-detained-rcna214801), an undocumented man with no criminal record who has lived and worked in the U.S. for decades. He has three sons, all of whom are either active-duty or veterans of the Marine Corps.

Over the weekend, Barranco was doing what he does every Saturday: working. [Video](https://www.nbcnews.com/now/video/video-of-man-violently-detained-by-border-patrol-agents-draws-online-backlash-242176069520) of the encounter shows Barranco being approached by armed, unidentified masked men while he was cutting the grass at an [IHOP](https://www.ihop.com/) restaurant. Frightened, Barranco fled, still holding his weed-whacker. The agents then caught up with him, sprayed him in the face with something, wrestled him to the ground and started beating him.

The [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/) [alleges](https://x.com/cbp/status/1937569960961970470?s=46&t=op3KnRWayVQwe0Xuza3lqQ) Barranco assaulted agents with his weed-whacker, but eyewitnesses, including the manager of that [IHOP](https://www.ihop.com/), say that’s not what they saw. “He was protecting himself,” [Guilermo Villarreal](https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/video-marine-corps-veterans-father-becomes-target-of-violent-ice-arrest/3730818/) told [KNBC](https://www.nbclosangeles.com/), the local [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/) affiliate. “He’s not attacking [anybody]. They were beating him so hard.”

According to Barranco’s family, he is currently being detained in an L.A. detention center. One of Barranco’s sons spoke to [KNBC](https://www.nbclosangeles.com/) about what his father experienced:

“In the video, it appears his shoulder was dislocated, and he got sprayed with mace in his eyes at, like, a very close distance,” said Alejandro Barranco, a [Marine](https://www.marines.mil/) veteran. “And I asked him about it, and he just broke down and said his shoulder was hurt, it hurt a lot. And then he said his eyes burn and he was thirsty, he was hungry.”

It was once generally understood that [family members of active-duty service members](https://www.ms.now/top-stories/latest/veteran-wife-mother-detained-ice-trump-rcna214581) should be protected from these kinds of deportations. But now it appears the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) administration is just indiscriminately deporting anyone they want.

Back in April, federal immigration enforcement [arrested the wife of an active-duty Coast Guardsman](https://apnews.com/article/coast-guard-immigration-arrest-navy-ice-8c59f778f3245b470871e1da96bf90e7) over an expired work visa as the couple was preparing to move into their on-base housing in [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/). In March, the wife of an [Army](https://www.army.mil/) sergeant, a woman named [Shirly Guardado,](https://www.latintimes.com/wife-active-duty-us-army-service-member-awaits-deportation-texas-despite-having-documentation-584042), who had filed paperwork for protected status, was deported by immigration officials in [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/).

According to Guardado’s family, who spoke with [The War Horse,](https://thewarhorse.org/military-family-members-not-safe-from-deportation/), a nonprofit news organization, she “got a strange phone call at work. Some sort of public safety officer had dialed her office and wanted her to come outside to talk.”

**His father’s treatment has left Alejandro Barranco feeling “betrayed” by the country he served.**

“In the parking lot, three men in plainclothes identified themselves as [Department of Public Safety](https://www.dps.texas.gov/home-page) officers,” her family alleges. “Shirly approached, they said her car had been involved in an accident. But when she got close, they grabbed her and handcuffed her, telling her they were [ICE agents](https://www.ice.gov/).”

These kinds of indiscriminate deportations of people who have not been convicted of any crime are morally destructive in their own right, but it is especially appalling for this [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), which claims [to stand up for troops and veterans](https://www.ms.now/11th-hour/watch/-he-s-not-here-to-serve-us-trump-promotes-military-parade-amid-veteran-protests-241099333808) while deporting their loved ones.

His father’s treatment has left Alejandro Barranco feeling “betrayed” by the country he served. “These are my people, and then, my dad is also my people, the community is my people, the military is my people,” he told [KNBC](https://www.nbclosangeles.com/). “At the end of the day, it’s like my people against my people, I just — I don’t know. I feel hurt.”
