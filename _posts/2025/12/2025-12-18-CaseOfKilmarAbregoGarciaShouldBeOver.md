## [Judge orders ICE not to detain Kilmar Abrego Garcia at his check-in](https://www.ms.now/news/judge-orders-ice-not-to-detain-kilmar-abrego-garcia-at-his-check-in)

*The order, issued just before Abrego Garcia’s scheduled appearance, bars agents from detaining him as they did in August.*

A federal judge barred [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement](https://www.ice.gov/) from detaining [Kilmar Abrego Garcia](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/kilmar-abrego-garcia-indicted-charges-trump-el-salvador-rcna203850) again ahead of his scheduled meeting on Friday with [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) in Baltimore.

The order from [U.S. District](https://www.mdd.uscourts.gov/) [Judge Paula Xinis](https://www.mdd.uscourts.gov/paula-xinis-district-judge) prevents [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) from seizing Abrego Garcia until the court can hold a hearing on a temporary restraining order that his attorneys requested.

Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. in June to face federal charges after the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) illegally deported him to [El Salvador](https://www.gob.sv/). He was released on bail, then redetained in August when he appeared for a check-in with [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/).

[Xinis](https://www.mdd.uscourts.gov/paula-xinis-district-judge) had [ordered Abrego Garcia’s release](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/judge-orders-kilmar-abrego-garcias-immediate-release-from-immigration-custody) from [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) custody on Thursday, writing that since his return from wrongful detention in [El Salvador](https://www.gob.sv/), federal agents detained him again “without lawful authority.”

“It is beyond dispute that unlawful detention visits irreparable harm,” [Xinis](https://www.mdd.uscourts.gov/paula-xinis-district-judge) wrote in her Friday order.

A spokesperson for [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/)’s parent agency, the [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/), denounced the judge’s order. The department has objected to other efforts to bar it from arresting people at immigration check-ins.

“This is naked judicial activism by an Obama-appointed judge,” [DHS](https://www.dhs.gov/) [Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin](https://www.dhs.gov/person/tricia-mclaughlin) said. “This order lacks any valid legal basis and we will continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts.”

Abrego Garcia spoke to supporters outside before entering the [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) office Friday morning, saying through a translator that he will “continue to fight and stand firm against all of the injustices this government has done upon me.”

“Regardless of this [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/), I believe this is a country of laws and I believe that this injustice will come to an end,” he said.
