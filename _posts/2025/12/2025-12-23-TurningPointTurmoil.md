## [Inside AmericaFest: Infighting, lies and the desperate search for Charlie Kirk’s heir](https://www.ms.now/news/americafest-infighting-conspiracy-theories-charlie-kirk)

*[Turning Point USA](https://tpusa.com/)’s flagship event, once a star-spangled show of strength for the right, revealed a [MAGA](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) movement in crisis following [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/)’s killing.*

Dec. 22, 2025, 6:00 AM EST
By [Brandy Zadrozny](https://www.ms.now/author/brandy-zadrozny)

PHOENIX — A couple of hundred [AmericaFest](ht tps://www.amfest.com/) attendees packed into the [Phoenix Convention Center](https://www.phoenixconventioncenter.com/) exhibit hall on Friday to see Erika [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) speak. Wearing a sharp black suit and an easy smile, the new CEO of [Turning Point USA](https://tpusa.com/) — arguably the country’s most powerful conservative political nonprofit — took her seat in front of a branded tour bus for a Q&A session, modeled after the “Prove Me Wrong” debates her late husband [Charlie Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) made famous.

But no one came to challenge Erika [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/).

Instead, a line of young women, most of them [Turning Point](https://tpusa.com=) chapter leaders, came with a more agreeable set of questions: whether Erika preferred waffles or pancakes, her favorite holiday “as a woman of God” and how to keep one’s femininity “in a feminist world.” They asked for advice on finding a husband, which beauty pageants she liked best and what books [Charlie](https://www.charliekirk.com/) read. (Everyone called him by his first name, like an old friend.) Erika’s answers, which sometimes rambled, included stories about her husband and insights into biohacking, divine timing, vitamin C, the dangers of Botox, her two small children and her grief, which felt heavy in the room. 

When he was killed in September, [Charlie](https://www.charliekirk.com/) left behind a political organization flush with money and influence, but without a singular talent or operator to wield either. His death came at a pivotal moment for [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s, currently bracing [for midterm losses](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/02/upshot/election-tennessee-republicans-democrats.html) and [losing favorability among young, energized voters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZxWg61ULZg) — the same demographic that makes up [TPUSA](https://tpusa.com/)’s sprawling national network and that helped usher in [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s second term. And despite Erika’s [full-throated endorsement](https://www.ms.now/news/erika-kirk-endorses-jd-vance-president-2028) of [Vice President JD Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) for his own [presidential](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) run in 2028, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s heir is far from apparent. 

**The question hanging over the conference wasn’t just who would take [Charlie Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/)’s place, but whether the [MAGA](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) movement he helped build would survive without him.**

Erika made clear that she believed she was equipped to lead.

“This isn’t a job,” she said. “This organization is a piece of my husband that lives on.” 

The couple had worked to grow [TPUSA](https://tpusa.com/) “in lockstep,” she said, and she was picking up a mantle that she understood well.

But not everyone at AmericaFest was convinced. 

“Those two children need a present mother,” said Michael Wilson, a 24-year-old radio host and self-described Christian nationalist from Houston. “[Charlie](https://www.charliekirk.com/) was very special in the sense that he could both run a business and be a really gifted orator and debater. Those things don’t usually go together.”

Erika, Wilson believed, belonged at home with her kids.

Three-quarters of the way through Erika’s event, the crowd had thinned. The room was hot, and some older attendees had grown weary from standing. Some headed to the food court, others to the main convention floor. Some went to take selfies and pay their respects at one of the exhibit hall’s main attractions: a tent identical to the one [Charlie](https://www.charliekirk.com/) was sitting under in [Utah](https://www.utah.gov/) when he was shot.

[AmericaFest[AmericaFest](https://www.amfest.com/), once a star-spangled show of strength for the conservative movement, was marked this year by visible fractures on the right over leadership, conspiracy theories surrounding [Charlie](https://www.charliekirk.com/)’s death, [Israel](https://www.gov.il/) and personal grudges. The unity [Charlie](https://www.charliekirk.com/) once commanded had splintered, and the question hanging over the conference wasn’t just who would take his place, but whether the [MAGA](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) movement he helped build would survive without him.

Getting to an answer requires an understanding of just what [Charlie Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) meant to the movement. In magazine profiles penned before his death, [Charlie](https://www.charliekirk.com/) was a “[kingmaker](http://google.com/search?q=atlantickingmakercharliekirk&rlz=1C5GCEM_enUS1181US1181&oq=atlantickingmakercharliekirk&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRg8MgYIAhBFGDwyBggDEEUYPdIBCDUyNjBqMGo3qAIAsAIA&ie=UTF-8),” the “[youth whisperer](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/magazine/charlie-kirk-american-right.html)” and the “[pied piper](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2025/07/18/charlie-kirk-pied-piper-of-the-american-right)” of the American right.

He first appeared on the punditry circuit as a quick-talking [Illinois](https://www.illinois.gov/) high schooler, proselytizing [on Faux News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zH-6Z3GXv0M) about free markets and all the ways that big government “sucked.” His popularity — and that of [TPUSA](https://tpusa.com/) — surged in the past decade, as he leaned into conservative culture war grievances and aligned his organization’s politics more closely with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s. Through [TPUSA](https://tpusa.com/), he built a movement that [upended the old [Republican establishment](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/15/turning-point-trump-battleground-states-00163563) and lit a fire under [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s base that helped secure his reelection in 2024. 

[Charlie](https://www.charliekirk.com/) was a [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) operative and fixer: He worked for (and befriended) [Donald Trump Jr.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donald-trump-jr-4454b862/), engineered [Robert F. Kennedy Jr.](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html)’s reign over federal health care, facilitated [Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/)’s political rise and recruited a new generation of young men to the [MAGA](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) movement. His message was familiar: America is under threat, from [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/), the government, immigrants, feminists, Satanists, Muslims, judges, the media, teachers, librarians, college professors, school boards, public health officials, LGBTQ people (especially trans people), diversity initiatives, big-box stores and leftists who want to steal your jobs, your guns, your children and your future.

[Charlie](https://www.charliekirk.com/)’s pitch resonated with conservative donors. [During the peak of the](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/turning-point-usa-donations-surged-pandemic-rcna37143) pandemic, wealthy supporters dumped cash into [Charlie](https://www.charliekirk.com/)’s tax-exempt organizations, [Turning Point](https://tpusa.com/) [USA](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/800835023) and [Turning Point](https://tpusa.com/) [Action](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/464331510). Under [Charlie](https://www.charliekirk.com/)’s leadership, [TPUSA](https://tpusa.com/) [amassed a war chest of almost \$400 million](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zacheverson/2025/09/22/turning-point-usa-charlie-kirk-donors-texas-foundation/) and raised more than \$80 million each of the past three years.

Critics cast [Charlie](https://www.charliekirk.com/) as “[the voice of a generation](https://www.instagram.com/reels/DOd4s6bjWyJ/)” and “[the face of Christian nationalism](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/christian-nationalists-churches-campaign-trump-charlie-kirk-1234947887/).” He was Rush Limbaugh’s [replacement on the radio](https://radioink.com/2021/04/09/kirk-lands-wabc-rush-slot/), and on social media, he was a master at rage-baiting his opponents. He turned the “[“debate me bro” gimmick](https://www.techdirt.com/2025/09/17/the-debate-me-bro-grift-how-trolls-weaponized-the-marketplace-of-ideas/)” gimmick of the early 2000s into a media strategy — one that, [according to his widow](https://www.instagram.com/reels/DSNyiAllqV3/), has earned the organization 5 billion views across multiple platforms.

“It took the better part of a decade for [Charlie Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) to build the influence that he was ultimately able to gain, some of which involved things that are not replicable,” [AJ Bauer](https://sites.ua.edu/ajbauer/), an assistant professor of journalism at the [University of Alabama](https://www.ua.edu/) who studies media and the political right, told [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/) last week.

[Bauer](https://sites.ua.edu/ajbauer/) continued: “Whoever replaces [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) will be navigating a [Republican Party](https://www.gop.com/) and a conservative movement that is in a different place, without the gravitational pull of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s personality that has mitigated conservative infighting.”

[Charlie](https://www.charliekirk.com/)’s death triggered a [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) scramble to cement his legacy — and in many cases capitalize on it. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, given a national day of remembrance and cited in a federal crackdown on what [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) calls “left-wing terrorism” — an effort [critics characterize](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/12/18/justice-department-fbi-first-amendment-antifa/) as a crackdown on political dissent. Streets were named after him, statues were erected, and several conservative states aided [Turning Point’s ongoing effort to open](https://www.foxnews.com/sports/turning-point-usa-partners-state-tennessee-establish-club-america-chapter) chapters at public high schools. Right-wing influencers doxed and harassed people who spoke ill of [Charlie](https://www.charliekirk.com/), now a martyr for the Christian conservative cause.

[Turning Point](https://tpusa.com/) didn’t suspend [Charlie](https://www.charliekirk.com/)’s campus tours after his death. Instead, a roster of big-name guest speakers — including right-wing media stars, members of [Congress](https;//www.congress.gov/) and the [vice president of the United States](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) — volunteered to fill the remaining dates. [Charlie](https://www.charliekirk.com/)’s podcast and radio show is still on the air, hosted now by [Turning Point](https://tpusa.com/) producer Andrew Kolvet and his co-host, Blake Neff, a former writer for [Tucker Carlson](https://tuckercarlson.com/) who was forced out in 2020 after [CNN unearthed](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jul/11/blake-neff-fox-writer-tucker-carlson-quits) a series of unsavory online posts that Fox News called “horrific, racist, misogynistic and homophobic.”

A [TPUSA](https://tpusa.com/) spokesperson declined an [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/) request to speak with Erika, explaining that the new CEO was “taking a very limited number of interviews.” Those have included appearances across [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/), with [Jesse Waters](https://www.foxnews.com/shows/jesse-watters-primetime), [Sean Hannity](https://hannity.com/) and [Brian Kilmeade](https://radio.foxnews.com/fox-news-talk/brian-kilmeade/) and on [“The Five”](https://www.foxnews.com/shows/the-five) and [“Faux & Friends,”](https://www.foxnews.com/shows/fox-and-friends) as well as a [CBS](https://www.cbsnews.com/) town hall with [Bari Weiss](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bari-weiss-3b4947259/). The comment sections under those appearances have been unkind to Erika — online mobs have criticized her for smiling too much, crying too little and coming off as a vapid widow or a grifting televangelist.

Meanwhile, a contingent of [MAGA](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) figureheads has moved on from grieving publicly over [Charlie](https://www.charliekirk.com/)’s death, giving way to [a web of conspiracy theories](https://www.ms.now/news/charlie-kirk-not-dead-conspiracy-theories-online-suspect-rcna231698). Far-right and far-out influencers have offered alternative explanations to the official account from local and federal law enforcement: that 22-year-old Tyler Robinson pulled the trigger. On YouTube, X and Instagram, they post baseless claims that [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/)’s death was staged or orchestrated by insiders at [Turning Point](https://tpusa.com/), among other theories.

The most prominent among them, [Candace Owens](https://www.candaceowens.com/) — whom [Charlie](https://www.charliekirk.com/) hired in 2017 as [TPUSA](https://tpusa.com/)’s director of urban engagement — has drawn millions of daily views to her sprawling theories, which involve [Turning Point](https://tpusa.com/) staff, the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/), the [French Foreign Legion](https://www.legion-etrangere.com/), the [Israeli government](https://www.gov.il/_8) and a network of Egyptian planes. This month, [Owens](https://www.candaceowens.com/) [called](https://x.com/RealCandaceO/status/1995848631304220684) [TPUSA](https://tpusa.com/) a “God-forsaken company” and encouraged its donors to request a refund. 

These conspiratorial claims and their creators fueled the tension hanging over [AmericaFest](https://www.amfest.com/) and led directly to a [a series of public spats](https://www.ms.now/news/ben-shapiro-tucker-carlson-clash-americafest). In his opening-night address, The [Daily Wire](https://www.dailywire.com/)’s [Ben Shapiro](https://www.dailywire.com/show/the-ben-shapiro-show) accused [Owens](https://www.candaceowens.com/) and [Carlson](https://tuckercarlson.com/) of poisoning the movement with conspiracy theories and antisemitism. [Owens](https://www.candaceowens.com/), he said, was “vomiting hideous and conspiratorial nonsense” about [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/)’s death. [Carlson](https://tuckercarlson.com/), he said, committed “an act of moral imbecility” last month when he hosted on his podcast “evil troll” [Nick Fuentes](https://nicholasjfuentes.com/) — a far-right streamer whom former [Vice President Mike Pence](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/people/mike-pence/) once described as a [“white nationalist, an antisemite and Holocaust denier.”](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-defends-tucker-carlson-after-interview-with-nick-fuentes-far-right-activist-known-for-his-antisemitic-views)

“[Charlie Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) despised [Nick Fuentes](https://nicholasjfuentes.com/),” [Shapiro](https://www.dailywire.com/show/the-ben-shapiro-show) said.

When it was his turn, [Carlson](https://tuckercarlson.com/) dismissed [Shapiro](https://www.dailywire.com/show/the-ben-shapiro-show) and mocked the idea that [Charlie](https://www.charliekirk.com/) would have supported deplatforming anyone. 

[Megyn Kelly](https://www.megynkelly.com/), another former [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) host targeted by [Shapiro](https://www.dailywire.com/show/the-ben-shapiro-show), said after his speech: “I don’t think we’re friends anymore.” Former [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) strategist Steve Bannon called [Shapiro](https://www.dailywire.com/show/the-ben-shapiro-show) “a cancer” who cared only about Israel and suggested he was “envious” of [Charlie](https://www.charliekirk.com/).

[Owens](https://www.candaceowens.com/), who did not attend the conference, baselessly [suggested on X](https://x.com/RealCandaceO/status/2001826552070447587) that [Shapiro](https://www.dailywire.com/show/the-ben-shapiro-show)’s speech proved [Israel](https://www.gov.il/)’s involvement in [Charlie](https://www.charliekirk.com/)’s death. She called [Shapiro](https://www.dailywire.com/show/the-ben-shapiro-show) a “worm,” a “miserable imp” and a “belly creature.”

Conspiracy theorist [Alex Jones](https://www.infowars.com/), known for perpetuating popular lies about the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, spoke against [Owens](https://www.candaceowens.com/)’ spiraling theories. 

“It’s just so damaging, and when you investigate it, it’s so crazy,” [Jones](https://www.infowars.com/), who also wasn’t present this year at [AmericaFest](https://www.amfest.com/), [posted to X](https://x.com/RealAlexJones/status/2002512711008334202) on Saturday. “I’m worried about her and her mind.”

Back at the convention, young conservative activists gathered at breakout sessions to refocus the conversation on the enemies that united them, like antifa and the godless. But the [MAGA](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) dogfight seemed to swallow all the oxygen at [AmericaFest](https://www.amfest.com/). 

“It’s weird,” said Jack Posobiec, a [Turning Point](https://tpusa.com/) personality and former alt-right activist known for spreading conspiracy theories, who spoke to [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/) as he waited to go live on [Newsmin](https://www.newsmax.com/). “I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t.”

In the end, amid all the infighting, Erika [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) was left to mother the movement. 

“Feels like a Thanksgiving dinner where your family’s hashing out the family business,” she offered from the stage on Friday.  

On Sunday, the final day of the event, [Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) took the stage to the Hollies’ “Long Cool Woman (In a Black Dress).” He cast [Charlie](https://www.charliekirk.com/) as a builder and unifier, and called on the [MAGA](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) movement to stop tearing itself apart.

“I didn’t bring a list of conservatives to denounce or deplatform,” [Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) said. “We have far more important work to do than canceling each other.”

[Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) seemed to find some common ground with the conspiratorial forces plaguing the movement, however. He claimed that he too had spent sleepless nights rewatching [Charlie Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/)’s death online and going down internet rabbit holes.

Ultimately, he said, [Charlie](https://www.charliekirk.com/)’s death was “an irreplaceable loss.” 

But if conservatives were going to win in the future, he  said, they’d only win together.
