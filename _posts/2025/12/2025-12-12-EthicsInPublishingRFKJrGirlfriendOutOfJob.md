## [What RFK Jr.'s escape from accountability in the Olivia Nuzzi scandal tells us about the Trump administration](https://www.ms.now/opinion/olivia-nuzzi-scandal-robert-kennedy-ethics)

*The lack of consequences is telling about the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/).*

Dec. 10, 2025, 6:12 PM EST
By [Eric Garcia](https://www.ms.now/author/eric-garcia)

There is a passage in [Olivia Nuzzi](https://www.simonandschuster.com/authors/Olivia-Nuzzi/161821310)’s sorta-memoir, [“American Canto,”](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/American-Canto/Olivia-Nuzzi](https://www.simonandschuster.com/authors/Olivia-Nuzzi/161821310)/9781668209851) that, if you look past the poor writing, says something striking. After news of their relationship broke, [Nuzzi](https://www.simonandschuster.com/authors/Olivia-Nuzzi/161821310) writes, she received a call. “‘I need you to take a bullet for me,’ the Politician said. ‘Please.’”

In [Nuzzi](https://www.simonandschuster.com/authors/Olivia-Nuzzi/161821310)’s telling, the Politician went on: “‘If it’s just sex, I can survive it.’ If it was anything more, he could not.”

One does not need to know details of [Nuzzi](https://www.simonandschuster.com/authors/Olivia-Nuzzi/161821310)’s apparent relationship with [Robert F. Kennedy Jr.](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) to understand that when [Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/contributor/vanity-fair) and [Nuzzi](https://www.simonandschuster.com/authors/Olivia-Nuzzi/161821310) announced last week that they [would part ways](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/05/business/media/vanity-fair-olivia-nuzzi.html), she was paying a professional price for personal behavior.

> **Meanwhile, the other participant in the affair seems to face no consequences.**

Meanwhile, the other participant in the affair seems to face no consequences.

[Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html), the secretary of [health and human services](https://www.hhs.gov/), is busy neutering the American public health system. [No Republicans have called for him to testify before Congress](https://www.notus.org/health-science/republicans-plead-ignorance-affair-drug-use-allegations-rfk-jr-nuzzi-lizza) about the allegations in [Nuzzi](https://www.simonandschuster.com/authors/Olivia-Nuzzi/161821310)’s book that he hid drug use during his presidential campaign.

[Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) isn’t waiting until the storm subsides; he’s simply walking outdoors and doesn’t mind the wind.

None of this is to defend [Nuzzi](https://www.simonandschuster.com/authors/Olivia-Nuzzi/161821310). She promoted a charlatan. For her lapse in ethics, losing her job is getting what she deserves.

But what does it say that [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) has faced next to no consequences for his part in what boils down to a sex and drugs scandal? And possibly predicted that if the scandal was simply about sex, he could ride out the storm?

[Nuzzi](https://www.simonandschuster.com/authors/Olivia-Nuzzi/161821310) [lost her job at New York Magazine](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/22/nx-s1-5160623/olivia-nuzzi-rfk-new-york-magazine) last fall after revelations that she had a relationship with [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html), whom she had [profiled for the magazine](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/robert-f-kennedy-jr-2024-presidential-campaign-politics.html). [Nuzzi](https://www.simonandschuster.com/authors/Olivia-Nuzzi/161821310) was [back in the spotlight](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/style/olivia-nuzzi-rfk-book-american-canto.html) recently not just with a plum new role at [Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/contributor/vanity-fair) and to promote her ([widely](https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2025/12/02/olivia-nuzzi-american-canto-memoir-review/) [panned](https://slate.com/culture/2025/12/olivia-nuzzi-rfk-donald-trump-ryan-lizza-book.html)) sorta-memoir but also because her ex-fiance, journalist [Ryan Lizza](https://www.telos.news/), alleged that she had [crossed more ethical boundaries as a journalist](https://nypost.com/2025/11/26/us-news/ryan-lizza-claims-then-fiancee-olivia-nuzzi-went-from-journalist-to-political-operative-for-rfk-jr-during-their-sexting-affair/).

The lowlights, from [Lizza](https://www.telos.news/)’s telling, are that [Nuzzi](https://www.simonandschuster.com/authors/Olivia-Nuzzi/161821310) drafted a strategy memo for [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) and that she engaged in [“catch-and-kill” missions](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/ryan-lizza-accuses-olivia-nuzzi-224655867.html) for him while he campaigned for president. (In non-journalist speak, [Lizza](https://www.telos.news/) alleges that [Nuzzi](https://www.simonandschuster.com/authors/Olivia-Nuzzi/161821310) essentially got members of [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html)’s campaign to divulge information so that she could prevent it from hitting the press.) [Lizza](https://www.telos.news/) also posted that [Nuzzi](https://www.simonandschuster.com/authors/Olivia-Nuzzi/161821310) had had an affair with another high-profile person she had written about, [former South Carolina governor Mark Sanford](https://www.telos.news/p/part-1-how-i-found-out). [Nuzzi](https://www.simonandschuster.com/authors/Olivia-Nuzzi/161821310)’s lawyer has referred to [Lizza](https://www.telos.news/)’s allegations as a “[harassment campaign](https://www.readfeedme.com/p/olivia-nuzzi-answers-your-questions)” and [said in a statement](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/style/olivia-nuzzi-ryan-lizza-rfk-jr-affair.html) that in her book, “([Ms. Nuzzi](https://www.simonandschuster.com/authors/Olivia-Nuzzi/161821310) discusses the only instance in her long career as a journalist in which she had an improper relationship with someone she was covering.”)

Meanwhile, the [health and human services](https://www.hhs.gov/) [secretary](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) [ignores reporters’ questions](https://nypost.com/2025/12/08/us-news/rfk-jr-shuns-the-posts-questions-about-olivia-nuzzi-affair-glares-at-reporter/) about the affair — and otherwise carries on unscathed. There is no outcry from [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) members of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/), who instead look the other way lest they risk angering [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).

The split-screen of the respective outcomes illustrates how officials in the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) elude accountability for immoral actions but consequences persist for others outside their gilded club.

To be clear, [Nuzzi](https://www.simonandschuster.com/authors/Olivia-Nuzzi/161821310) and [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) were not in equivalent positions. [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) was not a member of the [Cabinet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/) when he met [Nuzzi](https://www.simonandschuster.com/authors/Olivia-Nuzzi/161821310) and engaged in the alleged affair. It makes sense that there are professional consequences for [Nuzzi](https://www.simonandschuster.com/authors/Olivia-Nuzzi/161821310). She crossed clear ethical lines in journalism and did not disclose her relationship with [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) to her editors.

We can’t know now whether [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) would have been confirmed to his current role had [Nuzzi](https://www.simonandschuster.com/authors/Olivia-Nuzzi/161821310) come forward about their relationship or had she spoken out earlier, as she [wrote in her book](https://nypost.com/2025/12/02/us-news/olivia-nuzzi-book-reveals-how-rfk-jr-hid-bad-behavior/), that [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) told her he uses psychedelic drugs. He has said publicly that [he has been sober for years](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/29/us/politics/kennedy-rfk-profile-trump.html).

In the past, a series of salacious news stories about a [Cabinet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/) official would prompt a resignation or at least an apology. Instead, [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) carries on unfazed. It’s the same sort of shamelessness he has shown throughout his career as he has parroted debunked talking points about vaccines causing autism. He displays the same level of gall when [changing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s guidance](https://www.ms.now/opinion/rfk-vaccines-autism-cdc-trump) on vaccines despite supposedly having pledged not to do exactly that.

Ultimately, [Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/contributor/vanity-fair) is accountable to its readers and its parent company, [Conde Nast](https://www.condenast.com/). Ending [Nuzzi](https://www.simonandschuster.com/authors/Olivia-Nuzzi/161821310)’s contract showed that guardrails still exist in the media as a profession. (Or, at least, that publications will respond when faced with enough public pressure.) But [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html)’s continued employment in the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) shows that accountability does not exist for him.
