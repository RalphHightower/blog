## [Kash Patel told FBI detail to give girlfriend's friend a ride home](https://www.ms.now/news/kash-patel-girlfriend-fbi-detail-wilkins-ride-home)

*The [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [director](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel/)’s use of resources is under intense scrutiny as he insists he’s “a steward of the taxpayer dollars.”*

Dec. 5, 2025, 5:00 AM EST
By Carol Leonnig and Ken Dilanian

[FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Director Kash Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) has — on more than one occasion — ordered that the security detail protecting his [girlfriend](https://www.alexiswilkins.com/) escort one of her allegedly inebriated friends home after a night of partying in [Nashville](https://www.nashville.gov/), according to three people with knowledge of the incidents.

[Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s girlfriend, [Alexis Wilkins](https://www.alexiswilkins.com/), asked [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) agents on her security team at least two times, including once this spring, to drive her friend home, and agents objected to diverting from their assignment, said the sources, who were granted anonymity to discuss nonpublic matters. But [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) insisted they do as [Wilkins](https://www.alexiswilkins.com/) requested and in one case called the leader of [Wilkins](https://www.alexiswilkins.com/)’ security detail and yelled at him to do so.

News of the effort to deploy agents to provide security for a private citizen has spread through the bureau and beyond, as agents have grown increasingly concerned by [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s use of the bureau’s strapped resources, the people said.

[FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) spokesperson Ben Williamson broadly disputed that such events took place.

“This is made up and did not happen,” Williamson said.

At [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s direction, the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) provides a separate security detail for [Wilkins](https://www.alexiswilkins.com/), 27, a country music performer who lives part time in [Nashville](https://www.nashville.gov/) for her work. The [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) security detail, [first reported by MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/news/kash-patel-girlfriend-fbi-detail-alexis-wilkins-rcna243999), is made up of members of an elite [SWAT](https://www.fbi.gov/news/gallery/swat) team based in the area. It has spurred concerns about [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) abusing [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) resources to essentially drive his [girlfriend](https://www.alexiswilkins.com/) around for various events and appointments. The [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) has never before provided a separate security detail for a director’s [girlfriend](https://www.alexiswilkins.com/). Spouses of past directors typically received episodic security protection, but only when they were traveling with their spouse and the director’s detail.

Former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) agents and senior law enforcement officials said it was already disturbing that [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) had pulled elite tactical agents away from their [SWAT](https://www.fbi.gov/news/gallery/swat) mission to drive his [girlfriend](https://www.alexiswilkins.com/) around town. But they told [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/) they were shocked that the director instructed tactical agents to use their time on yet another person the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) had no reasonable duty to protect.

“Not only is the assignment of [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [SWAT](https://www.fbi.gov/news/gallery/swat) personnel to a security detail to protect his [girlfriend](https://www.alexiswilkins.com/) inappropriate, directing these highly trained professionals to babysit his [girlfriend](https://www.alexiswilkins.com/)’s friend is outrageous, and demonstrative of [Kash Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s complete lack of judgment and integrity,” said former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) agent Christopher O’Leary, an [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/) contributor. “[FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) agents serve the public and swear an oath to protect and defend the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/). This is clearly a long way from that.”

[Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) and [Deputy Director Dan Bongino](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/deputy-director-dan-bongino/) were criticized this week as ineffectual leaders who have left the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) “rudderless” since they took the helm, according to a [report](https://nypost.com/2025/11/30/opinion/damning-report-labels-fbi-rudderless-ship-under-kash-patel-with-he-and-dan-bongino-more-concerned-with-building-personal-resumes/), based on anonymous complaints and accounts from more than 20 former and current [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) and law enforcement personnel. [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) was described as “insecure,” often exploding into tantrums, and lacking the professionalism to withstand the public spotlight that is a natural part of his position.

The report, dated November 2025, appears to have been prepared for delivery to both the Senate and House judiciary committees.

The report cited one agent, a self-described [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) supporter, as saying that [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) “lacks the requisite experience” or the “measured self-confidence” to be [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director.

One source for the report stated, “[Director Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s composure erodes very quickly when confronted by critics,” which appeared to be “a reflection of [Director Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s lack of self-confidence.”

In the wake of the Sept. 10 assassination of conservative activist [Charlie Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/), the report said [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) called Robert Bohls, the special agent in charge of the [Salt Lake City office](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/saltlakecity), and yelled at him about the lack of progress in the case, asking if he needed to go out to [Utah](https://www.utah.gov/) to run the investigation himself.

Upon arriving in [Salt Lake](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/saltlakecity) on Sept. 11, [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) directed “an expletive-laden tirade” at Bohls, complaining about what [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) considered blunders in the [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) probe, the report said.

At the same time, according to the report, agents found [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s manner and priorities during his visit disconcerting, and he became the subject of agent derision. [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel), the report said, would not get off his [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) jet until agents brought him a medium-size [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) raid jacket to wear for the cameras outside. The report said agents involved in the probe had to be pulled away from their assignments to help find a jacket that would fit [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel). The director also insisted that some shoulder patches be attached to the jacket, and these were ultimately borrowed from a female [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) agent, the report said.

[In an interview with Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/media/kash-patel-defends-fbi-jet-use-house-democrats-launch-probe-personal-travel) on Tuesday night, [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) addressed the leaked report, saying the jacket story is “100% false.”

“One of my agents handed me a jacket and said, ‘Hey, boss, you should probably wear this, we’re going to the command center.’ I said I would be honored to wear that,” [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) said. “And another one handed me the [SWAT](https://www.fbi.gov/news/gallery/swat) team badge of the unit that was protecting the area where [Charlie](https://www.charliekirk.com/) was assassinated. I wore that with pride.”

[MS NOW reported last week](https://www.ms.now/news/trump-kash-patel-replacing-fbi-director-planes-girlfriend) that [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is considering removing [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) as [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director in the coming months, as [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his top aides have grown increasingly frustrated by a series of unflattering headlines, including [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s use of a government jet for what critics called a “date night” to see his [girlfriend](https://www.alexiswilkins.com/) perform in [Pennsylvania](https://www.pa.gov/). [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) and the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) disputed that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) may replace the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director.

Some former agents compared [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s decisions about personal use of bureau resources to those of [William Sessions](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/william-s-sessions), the first [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director to be fired in U.S. history.

In 1993, [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Bill Clinton](https://clintonwhitehouse2.archives.gov/) fired [Sessions](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/william-s-sessions) [based on an internal investigation](https://www.governmentattic.org/3docs/DOJ-OPR-WlliamSessions_1992-1993.pdf) that found [Sessions](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/william-s-sessions) had misused [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) resources for personal trips for himself and his wife. A report documented that [Sessions](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/william-s-sessions), who was first appointed by [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [George H.W. Bush](https://www.bush41.org/) and continued as director in the [Clinton [administration](https://clintonwhitehouse2.archives.gov/), forced security agents off [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) planes and demanded they fly commercially so that his wife could accompany him at government expense. At [Sessions](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/william-s-sessions)’ direction, the report concluded, [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) aircraft were diverted to pick up his wife in other cities, and [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) vehicles were employed to take her to get her nails done, shop and pick up firewood. The report, conducted by the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/)’s [Office of Professional Responsibility](https://www.justice.gov/opr), found that [Sessions](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/william-s-sessions) had scheduled official appointments in specific locations to justify charging the government for personal travel and improperly billed the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) almost \$10,000 for a fence around his home.

In the [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) interview, [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) addressed the jet controversy, insisting that he is not allowed to fly commercially.

“I’m entitled to a personal life, just like my other agency-head counterparts with their partners. Do I support my [girlfriend](https://www.alexiswilkins.com/)? Absolutely. Do I take trips with her? Absolutely. But when they’re talking about raid jackets and Velcro and [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) plane use, they’re not talking about the facts, because they know this [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) is succeeding in ways prior leadership failed,” [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) said.

“I am a steward of the taxpayer dollars.”
