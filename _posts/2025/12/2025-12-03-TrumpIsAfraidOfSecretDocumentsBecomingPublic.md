## [Despite talk of ‘transparency,’ Team Trump wants to keep Jack Smith’s findings under wraps](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/despite-talk-of-transparency-team-trump-wants-to-keep-jack-smiths-findings-under-wraps)

*In the classified documents case, the former special counsel submitted his final report months ago. The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s lawyers don’t want us to see it.*

One of the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s [more unusual boasts](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-house-says-trumps-piggy-insult-was-just-open-honest-rcna245113) is that [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is “the most transparent [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) in history.” It’d be easier to take the claim seriously if the public had gained access to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s tax returns, the Jeffrey Epstein files, the rationale behind the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s recent MRI and [the video of border czar Tom Homan allegedly accepting a bag full of cash](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/tom-homan-controversy-intensifies-doesnt-fbi-just-release-tapes-rcna233144) from undercover [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) agents (to name just a few things). But to date, these have all remained under wraps.

This list is still growing: This week, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) argued that former special counsel [Jack Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith)’s final report in the classified documents case should never be made public.

A [Politico report](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/02/trump-jack-smith-classified-docs-report-00673178) noted that previous special counsels have written reports that were provided to [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) and made public, “even when they have included damaging findings about the incumbent administration.” But in the [classified documents case](https://www.ms.now/news/trump-arrest-classified-documents-probe-maralago-rcna241155), which led to [37 felony counts](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-37-count-indictment-unsealed-released-public-rcna88613) related to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s alleged mishandling and withholding of sensitive records, there’s been no such disclosure.

To be sure, [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) and his team submitted their findings earlier this year, but the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and his lawyers want to keep it hidden indefinitely.

This effort might very well work out for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), since his legal team made its appeal to [U.S. District Judge](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/) [Aileen Cannon](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/content/judge-aileen-m-cannon), the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-appointed jurist who has [earned an unfortunate reputation as a relentlessly biased conservative](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/judge-cannon-sides-trump-dismisses-classified-docs-case-rcna161882).

But if [Cannon](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/content/judge-aileen-m-cannon) once again tells [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) what he wants to hear, there may very well be consequences beyond the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)’s bid for secrecy about one of his most embarrassing scandals. The [Politico](https://www.politico.com/) report added:

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s effort could complicate efforts by congressional [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) to grill [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) about the substance of his investigation. [Cannon](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/content/judge-aileen-m-cannon)’s order bars the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) from disseminating the results of its investigation to outsiders, including [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/). While [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith)’s final classified documents report remains under seal, he may not have authority to discuss its findings with lawmakers.

In October, [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republican6](https://www.gop.com/) announced plans to bring [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) to Capitol Hill to answer lawmakers’ questions. The former special counsel replied that he’d welcome that opportunity, [but only if the public were allowed to watch the proceedings](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jack-smith-ready-respond-gop-questions-wants-public-see-answers-rcna239538).

If the prosecutor’s findings are kept hidden by a federal court, however, there may be very little to talk about at a congressional hearing. Watch this space.
