## [Senate Democrats threaten to sue Trump DOJ over Epstein files](https://www.ms.now/news/senate-democrats-threaten-to-sue-trump-doj-over-epstein-files)

*A coalition of [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) led by [Minority Leader](https://bioguide.congress.gov/search/bio/S000148) [Chuck Schumer](https://www.schumer.senate.gov/) demanded the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) comply with Friday's deadline to release its files related to Jeffrey Epstein.*

Dec. 16, 2025, 4:11 PM EST
By [Sydney Carruth](https://www.ms.now/author/sydney-carruth)

The [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) is up against a deadline to publicly release government files on Jeffrey Epstein — and [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)s don’t plan on letting the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) forget the clock ticking.

[Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Minority Leader](https://bioguide.congress.gov/search/bio/S000148) [Chuck Schumer (D-NY)](https://www.schumer.senate.gov/) is at the helm of a coalition of [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) lawmakers demanding the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) comply with Friday’s deadline to release the remainder of the Epstein files — as mandated by a law [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) passed last month — or face legal action.

“Let me be blunt,” [Schumer](https://www.schumer.senate.gov/) said at a news conference Tuesday. “We fully expect [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) and their minions to dodge, delay or partially release these files.”

[Schumer](https://www.schumer.senate.gov/) said [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)s have established a task force to review the documents scheduled to be released Friday amid concerns [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) will unnecessarily redact information from the files to protect the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and his allies.

“If they release some documents and hide others, the American people will see right through it, and they’ll ask the obvious question,” [Schumer](https://www.schumer.senate.gov/) said. “We are all asking the obvious question that looms, [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), what are you trying to hide?”

The [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) minority leader, who was joined Tuesday by [Sens.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Dick Durbin (D-IL)](https://www.durbin.senate.gov/), [Ron Wyden (D-OR)](https://www.wyden.senate.gov/), [Richard Blumenthal (D-CT)](https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/), [Amy Klobuchar (D-MN)](https://www.klobuchar.gov/), and [Jeff Merkley (D-OR)](https://www.merkley.senate.gov/), said the task force has been “preparing for every scenario.”

The group plans to work with attorneys representing survivors of late [New York](https://www.ny.gov) financier Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking enterprise and individuals intimately familiar with the federal investigation into Epstein’s abuse to ensure the documents were not tampered with prior to release.

[Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) [voted overwhelmingly](https://www.ms.now/news/senate-passes-epstein-bill-rcna244723) on Nov. 18 to pass the [Epstein Files Transparency Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/4405/text) after months of infighting. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) swiftly signed it into law in a surprising reversal of his stance on releasing the files, which came after GOP lawmakers indicated they would vote with [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) to force a release of the files, leaving the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) with no choice but to act.

The law compels the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) to release “all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials” related to the investigations into Epstein and his convicted co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell. That includes travel records, flight logs, immunity deals and related internal [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) communications.

Three federal judges, one in [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/) and two in [New York](https://www.ny.gov/), have since [granted DOJ requests](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyz2vyzek9o) to release sealed grand jury transcripts related to criminal investigations of Epstein and Maxwell, in compliance with the act. The judges each warned the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) it must take careful precaution to protect the privacy of Epstein’s victims before the material becomes public.

Legal experts have expressed concern over the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/)’s ability to properly redact victim information from the thousands of documents in time to meet the Friday release deadline.

Though the transparency act demands a broad scope of documents be released, it exempts any information that could publicly identify Epstein’s victims. It also exempts information that could jeopardize national security and ongoing federal investigations.

[Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)s made it clear Tuesday those exemption rules do not include information that could incriminate [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) or his inner circle.

“If the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) withholds some documents unlawfully, we will know. If they abuse narrow exemptions to hide the truth, we will know, and there will be serious legal and political consequences,” [Schumer](https://www.schumer.senate.gov/) said.

“This wouldn’t be the first time [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) tried to trick the public with a binder full of chicken feed,” [Wyden](https:://www.wyden.senate.gov/) said. “That’s what she did back in the spring, which infuriated [MAGA](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) voters who took [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his cronies at their word that they released the files.”

The [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) and [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) [announced in July](https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1407001/dl?inline) that an internal “systematic review revealed no incriminating ‘client list’” and that further disclosures were not warranted. [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) appeared to suggest in February that she had the list [on her desk](https://thehill.com/homenews/5158153-jeffrey-epstein-client-list-bondi-review/), but she and the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) later clarified she had been referring to the tranche of Epstein case files in [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) possession, not a single client list.

[Wyden](https://www.wyden.senate.gov/) Tuesday accused [Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/) [Secretary Scott Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) of stonewalling a [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Finance Committee](http://www.finance.senate.gov/) investigation into the financing of Epstein’s sex trafficking enterprise. [Wyden](https://www.wyden.senate.gov/), the top [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) on the committee, said the [Treasury Department](https://home.treasury.gov/) denied [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) access to key financial records that offer “a financial roadmap into how Epstein hurts so many families.”

[Durbin](https://www.durbin.senate.gov/), the ranking member of the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Judiciary Committee](http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/), sent a [letter](https://www.schiff.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Letter-to-DOJ-IG-re-Epstein-Files.pdf) last week to the acting [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) inspector general demanding  an internal audit of Epstein materials. [Durbin](https://www.durbin.senate.gov/) said a review of the chain of custody would “show in detail who had control of evidence so that questions concerning contamination, tampering, or concealment do not arise.”

“[Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) will be actively involved letting people know how disgraceful this has been,” [Schumer](https://www.schumer.senate.gov/) said Tuesday. He added, “Obviously, we would pursue every legal, legislative and administrative way to get this done as well, but public pressure will be everything.”
