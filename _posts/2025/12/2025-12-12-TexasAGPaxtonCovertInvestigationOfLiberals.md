## [Texas AG Ken Paxton announces ‘undercover’ investigations into liberals](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/ken-paxton-texas-investigations-liberals-trump-antifa-rcna236856)

*The [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) candidate’s announcement of the probes targeting liberals is modeled after [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s authoritarian attacks.*

Oct. 11, 2025, 6:00 AM EDT
By [Ja'han Jones](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jahan-jones-ncpn371241)

[Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) [Attorney General](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/) [Ken Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office), [who’s a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/texas-senate-ken-paxton-divorce-biblical-republican-primary-rcna218440), says his office is planning to launch undercover operations targeting liberals.

The [scandal-plagued Paxton](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/texas-ken-paxton-hopes-parlay-multiple-scandals-gop-senate-campaign-rcna200385) has incentive to carve a lane for himself as the [Trumpiest](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) candidate in the primary.

Last year, he reached a deal to avoid a [securities fraud trial](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/texas-attorney-general-ken-paxton-deal-avoid-trial-rcna145161) and [avoided removal from office](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/texas-attorney-general-ken-paxton-acquitted-impeachment-trial-rcna104816) after being impeached over corruption allegations.

That’s helpful context for his conspiracy theory-filled announcement of undercover investigations into liberals, which he said will complement [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s efforts to [use federal agencies and the military](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-war-antifa-portland-rcna236670) against antifa.

That [Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office) announced these supposedly undercover investigations, which he claims are “in response to the political assassination of national hero [Charlie Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) and the disturbing rise of leftist violence across the country,” is a clear indicator he sees the probes as tools to intimidate. The statement includes fact-free claims like the following:

Leftist political terrorism is a clear and present danger. Corrupted ideologies like transgenderism and Antifa are a cancer on our culture and have unleashed their deranged and drugged-up foot soldiers on the American people.

None of that is supported by evidence. The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) was caught hiding the federal government’s own assessments showing [far-right extremists](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/17/justice-department-study-far-right-extremist-violence) have been responsible for the bulk of domestic terrorism — far outpacing leftist violence — over the past three decades. [“Transgenderism” isn’t an “ideology,”](https://glaad.org/fact-sheet-for-reporters-term-to-avoid-gender-ideology/) and there’s certainly no evidence to support the [tired right-wing claim](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/08/29/shooting-minnesota-school-transgender-online-untruths/85876291007/) that trans people are disproportionately violent. Nor is there evidence that “drugged-up foot soldiers” for antifa — which the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) has previously stated is [not an official organization](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-ap-top-news-elections-james-comey-politics-bdd3b6078e9efadcfcd0be4b65f2362e) — are wreaking havoc on Americans.

“The martyrdom of [Charlie Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) marks a turning point in America. There can be no compromise with those who want us dead,” [Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office) said in his statement, adding that he has directed his office to “identify, investigate, and infiltrate these leftist terror cells.”

Again, there’s no evidence the man accused of killing [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) sought to target anyone else. And there’s also no evidence to support [Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office)’s allegations about the existence of leftist “terror cells” that pose threats to Americans.

“To those demented souls who seek to kill, steal, and destroy our country, know this: you cannot hide, you cannot escape, and justice is coming,” the attorney general declared. It’s quite ironic that this is coming from an attorney general who has worked with the [True Texas Project](https://truetexasproject.com/), an activist group that has been [associated with neo-Nazi propaganda](https://www.texastribune.org/2024/06/12/true-texas-project-conference-christian-nationalism/) and has platformed blatant white supremacists.

[Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office)’s threats add to [the growing heap of evidence](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/20/charlie-kirk-funeral-trump-republicans) showing officials in the [insurrectionist-aligned [MAGA movement](https://www.cbsnews.com/detroit/news/january-6-rioters-trump-heroes-candidates-office/) are using the killing of [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) — which literally unfolded while [a gunman allegedly infatuated with right-wing killers](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/colorado-evergreen-high-school-shooter-extremist-police-rcna230875) shot up a school in the next state over — to portray liberals as the true violent threats and crack down on their civil rights.
