## [What the fall of the Heritage Foundation says about the future of conservatism in the U.S.](https://www.ms.now/morning-joe/heritage-foundation-exodus-fight-conservative-movement-trump)

*A fight to define the future of the conservative movement appears to be on the horizon.*

Dec. 23, 2025, 3:57 PM EST

This is an adapted excerpt from the [Dec. 23](https://www.ms.now/morning-joe) episode of “Morning Joe.”

More than a dozen staff members at the [Heritage Foundation](https://www.ms.now/top-stories/latest/republican-party-embraces-extremism-tucker-carlson-nick-fuentes-rcna243058), an influential conservative think tank, [leaving the embattled organization](https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/top-heritage-officials-flee-to-mike-pences-nonprofit-as-think-tank-fractures-28765f2b?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqc_8BafL7-9wHN1m-gFxG5G6F_geK7yq0y9DGPkqhSP9NYXxtDUf3Z5nfOVKjY%3D&gaa_ts=694ae2ff&gaa_sig=xcdb6fGwrrST8S-J8A6Ws_rolKS93uakBJICtKbhDtWZFs5SoZAr3I1S9lhdrHoAc1W8N446X_71DQ6bWabukg%3D%3D) to join [Advancing American Freedom](https://advancingamericanfreedom.com/), a nonprofit founded by former [Vice President](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/people/mike-pence) [Mike Pence.](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/new-comments-epstein-files-mike-pence-says-trump-didnt-want-hear-rcna219588).

The staffers’ exodus follows a [wave of resignations](https://www.ms.now/top-stories/latest/heritage-foundation-board-tucker-carlson-fuentes-roberts-rcna244475) earlier this month, after [Heritage Foundatio](https://www.heritage.org/) [President Kevin Roberts](https://www.heritage.org/staff/kevin-d-roberts-phd) defended a friendly interview between former [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) host [Tucker Carlson](https://www.ms.now/news/ben-shapiro-tucker-carlson-clash-americafest) and [Nick Fuentes](https://www.ms.now/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tucker-carlson-nick-fuentes-interview-heritage-foundation-outrage-rcna241251), a white nationalist who has praised Adolf Hitler.

This is a humiliating loss for [Roberts](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-d-roberts-5ba65047/). It’s also a very interesting coup for Pence, whom I think a lot of people had written off and just assumed would be irrelevant. Now he has a conservative think tank in exile.

But this has been a long time coming, hasn’t it? You can trace the evolution of conservatism in the United States by looking at what has happened to the [Heritage Foundatio](https://www.heritage.org/) in the last few decades.

Back in the 1980s, the organization was the beating heart and intellectual center of the conservative movement. It helped define the “Reagan revolution” and influenced [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) politics at every level.

But in recent years, that has changed.

One of the biggest transformations that [Donald Trump](https://www.ms.now/white-house) and [MAGA](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) have inflicted upon the conservative movement is that it’s no longer about principles or ideas; it’s about a [cult of personality](https://www.ms.now/the-reidout/watch/trump-cult-of-personality-in-gop-slammed-by-joy-reid-in-the-absolute-worst-130840645705) and serving one man’s personal impulses. The [Heritage Foundation](https://www.heritage.org/) followed that path, abandoning core conservative values to align itself with [Trumpism](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).

Seeing this many influential people leave, however, does feel like an indication that [a fight](https://www.ms.now/top-stories/latest/trump-vs-musk-republican-civil-war-budget-bill-rcna211168) to define the future of the conservative movement could be on the horizon. It appears as if we are going to have the kind of debate that, in effect, has been shut down during the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) years.
