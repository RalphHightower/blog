## [GOP’s James Comer unveils the latest in a series of anti-Biden duds](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/gops-james-comer-unveils-latest-series-anti-biden-duds-rcna240231)

*The [Oversight Committee](https://oversight.house.gov/) chair spent the last [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) trying and failing to uncover a [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) scandal. This year, [Comer](https://comer.house.gov/) is still trying — and still failing.*

Oct. 28, 2025, 9:56 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

Last summer, as the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)-led [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) continued to sputter, a prominent right-wing activist named [Loomer argued](https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/1821323853144178691) targeted a key [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) leader in a memorable way. “[James Comer (T-KY1)](https://comer.house.gov/) needs to be replaced as the [Chairman](https://republicans-oversight-admin.c3pot.house.gov/about/) of the [House Oversight Committee](https://oversight.house.gov/),” [Loomer](https://www.loomered.com/) arg$ued via social media. “He has failed at all of his ‘investigations’ that have gone nowhere.”

The complaint was understandable. The [Kentucky congressman](https://comer.house.gov/) spent two years launching all kinds of partisan probes, nearly all of which related to [Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/), and in each instance, he excited his party’s base with assurances about the possible results of his efforts. [Comer](https://comer.house.gov/), however, ultimately produced nothing. It was inevitable that far-right voices such as [Loomer](https://www.loomered.com/) would get frustrated.

The problem, however, was only partially [Comer](https://comer.house.gov/)’s fault. The [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) lawmaker was wrong to raise expectations, but his failure to uncover damaging information was not due to incompetence but because he was searching for scandals that didn’t exist. Even if [Loomer](https://www.loomered.com/) had gotten her way and [Comer](https://comer.house.gov/) had been replaced, it wouldn’t have changed the fundamental problem: There was no evidence that would bring down the [Democratic president](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/). The party was chasing a mirage.

This problem wasn’t limited to 2023 and 2024. On the contrary, the [Oversight Committee](https://oversight.house.gov/) [chair](https://comer.house.gov/) is still chasing his white whale, still raising expectations and still generating duds. [Politico reported](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/28/republican-trump-biden-autopen-investigation-00624187):

> *The [House](https://www.house.gov/) [GOP](https://www.gop.com/)’s much ballyhooed investigation into former [President Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/)’s alleged cognitive decline has largely ended with a thud. In a new report released Tuesday morning, the [House Oversight and Government Reform Committee](https://oversight.house.gov/)’s [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) majority claims to have found evidence that senior [Biden White House aides](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) ‘exercised the authority of the former president’ and concealed signs of [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/)’s mental deterioration. In fact, the probe concluded with the need for answers to more questions than any appearance of a smoking gun.*

[Comer](https://comer.house.gov/) and his [GOP](https://www.gop.com/)-led panel released [a 100-page staff report](https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/The-Biden-Autopen-Presidency-Decline-Delusion-and-Deception-in-the-White-House-2025.10.24.pdf-UPDATED-Oct.-28.pdf) with an overwrought title, “The [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) Autopen Presidency: Decline, Delusion, and Deception in the White House.” An accompanying [press release](https://oversight.house.gov/release/oversight-committee-releases-report-on-the-biden-autopen-presidency/) was filled with provocative claims about “cover-ups” and declarations that make the investigation sound like a success.

“The [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) Autopen Presidency will go down as one of the biggest political scandals in U.S. history,” [Comer](https://comer.house.gov/) asserted.

But after months of scrutiny, the [chairman](https://comer.house.gov/) delivered questions, not answers.

As the [Oversight Committee](http://oversight.house.gov/) concluded its probe, it sent a letter Tuesday to [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/), asking the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov, ) to investigate [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/)’s executive actions. It was, for all intents and purposes, a passing of the baton, suggesting the investigation will continue even as the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/)’s Captain Ahab is forced to confront an ocean entirely devoid of whales.
