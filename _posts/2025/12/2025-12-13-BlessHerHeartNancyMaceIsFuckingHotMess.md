## [Rep. Nancy Mace turned an encounter with airport staff into a ‘spectacle,’ report says](https://www.ms.now/news/rep-nancy-mace-turned-an-encounter-with-airport-staff-into-a-spectacle-report-says)

*The investigation found that the [South Carolina Republican](https://mace.house.gov/) called airport staff “fucking idiots” and “fucking incompetent,”and declared that she was a “fucking representative.”*

Rep. [Nancy Mace (T-SC1)](https://mace.house.gov/) escalated a situation with the staff at [Charleston International Airport](https://iflychs.com/) during an encounter in October, creating a “spectacle” that left employees “visibly upset,” according to a police report.

The investigative report from the [airport](https://iflychs.com/)’s police department, obtained by [The Post and Courier](https://www.postandcourier.com/politics/nancy-mace-charleston-airport-records-investigation/article_96240cff-509f-457c-a1b8-d4836835d527.html), describes the [South Carolina Republican](https://mace.house.gov/) berating [Transportation Security Administration](https://www.tsa.gov/) officers and airport police as “fucking idiots” and “fucking incompetent,” declaring that she was a “fucking representative” and telling them, “I’m sick of your shit.”

The airport bears “a certain level of responsibility” for a misunderstanding about the color of the car that [Mace](https://mace.house.gov/) would arrive in, which led to a delay in finding her police escort, the report says. But [Mace](https://mace.house.gov/)’s continued failure to follow procedures turned “a minor miscommunication over the color of a vehicle into the spectacle that this issue has become for our employees and airport workers,” the investigation found.

[Mace](https://mace.house.gov/)’s office did not immediately respond to [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/)’s request for comment. However, [Sydney Long](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sydneylongsc/), a spokesperson from [Mace](https://mace.house.gov/)’s office, said the investigation completely cleared [Mace](https://mace.house.gov/).

“We appreciate this full exoneration and look forward to remaining fully focused on the issues that actually matter to [South Carolinians](https://www.sc.gov/): affordability and law and order,” [Long](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sydneylongsc/) told [The Post and Courier](https://www.postandcourier.com/), which obtained the full report through a public records request.

The late October encounter was briefly documented in an incident report at the time. [Mace](https://mace.house.gov/), who is running for [governor](https://governor.sc.gov/) of [South Carolina](https://www.sc.gov/), wrote in a [post on X](https://x.com/NancyMace/status/1984313972741276012) then that there was a “rumor” that [TSA](https://www.tsa.gov/) would not let her through, calling it “false” and “silly.”

The incident has prompted the [Charleston International Airport Police Department](https://iflychs.com/passengers/emergency-safety/) to [change its policy](https://www.postandcourier.com/politics/charleston-airport-vip-lawmaker-tsa-rules/article_c9c7cd16-0b23-4378-913d-9fb461fc71d5.html) for federal lawmakers and other politicians traveling through the airport.

[Mace](https://mace.house.gov/) has since repeatedly [threatened legal action](https://x.com/RepNancyMace/status/1985565955963900093) against the airport and [American Airlines](https://www.aa.com/), alleging that they “falsified incident reports to defame me.” She has hinted that she was targeted for “[extra surveillance](https://x.com/NancyMace/status/1988446194868085216)” at the airport and [suggested](https://x.com/NancyMace/status/1988773859764437129) that if she sued, it would take down “South Carolina’s political class and political consultants” and that it would be the “highlight of my career.”
