## [Trump hosts Kennedy Center Honors, prioritizing playing over governing](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-hosts-kennedy-center-honors-prioritizing-playing-over-governing)

*Who's calling the shots in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) while [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) pursues his many self-indulgent distractions, playing in the world’s most powerful sandbox?*

Dec. 8, 2025, 8:00 AM EST
By [Steve Benen](https://www.ms.now/author/steve-benen)

At an [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) event on Saturday for those receiving this year’s [Kennedy Center](https://www.kennedy-center.org/) [Honors](https://www.kennedy-center.org/whats-on/honors/), [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) took some time to talk about [his role in the event](https://www.ms.now/news/trump-kennedy-center-honors). “We never had a [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) hosting the awards before,” [he noted](https://x.com/Acyn/status/1997436635894739360), adding, “If I can’t beat out [Jimmy Kimmel](https://abc.com/show/9bfe2f4f-41ad-4492-a6dd-0b67db180543) in terms of talent, then I don’t think I should be [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).”

It was probably intended as a joke, but it was an odd attempt at humor. [Kimmel](https://abc.com/show/9bfe2f4f-41ad-4492-a6dd-0b67db180543) is a longtime entertainment professional who’s hosted awards shows; [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is ostensibly the chief executive of the world’s preeminent superpower. There’s no reason for the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) to assume he should be equally capable of serving as a master of ceremonies: The two jobs require spectacularly different skill sets.

Except, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) doesn’t quite see it that way. On the contrary, the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/), perhaps best known to much of the public as the host of a reality television gameshow before entering politics, apparently still wants to be seen less as a political leader and more as a star. [The New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/07/us/politics/trump-kennedy-center-honors.html):

> *[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) took the stage at the [Kennedy Center](https://www.kennedy-center.org/) [Honors](https://www.kennedy-center.org/whats-on/honors/) on Sunday night, making himself the face of an arts event he once shunned as he paid tribute to the actor Sylvester Stallone, the singer Gloria Gaynor and other artists.*

> *While [presidents](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) typically attend the event at the [John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts](https://www.kennedy-center.org/), [Mr. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is the first to host it, putting his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s cultural takeover of [Washington](https://dc.gov/) and its institutions on vivid display.*

The event was the culmination of a bizarre series of events. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) appointed himself chair of the [Kennedy Center](https://www.kennedy-center.org/) [Board of Trustees](https://www.kennedy-center.org/about-us/leadership/trustees/) earlier this year, and he started naming loyalists to leadership roles at the institution while purging its [traditionally bipartisan board](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/us/politics/trump-kennedy-center.html).

In the weeks that followed, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) maintained a hands-on role, personally vetoing prospective [Kennedy Center](https://www.kennedy-center.org/) honorees whom [he found objectionable](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-kennedy-center-honors-host-ceremony-stallone-rcna224819) on ideological grounds.

What he neglected to explain is how, exactly, he managed to find the time.

There is a degree of irony to the broader circumstances. Much of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s case against [Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) is rooted in the dubious claim that his [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) predecessor was detached from his weighty responsibilities, allowing those around him to exert their will, taking advantage of a [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) who’d largely removed himself from his day-to-day duties.

It was the right condemnation, applied to the wrong [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).

In recent weeks, Americans have seen their [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) take a great interest in a seemingly endless stream of trivialities that his modern predecessors would’ve gladly delegated to others. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) hosted an awards show he controlled, after hosting a [couple](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-kennedy-center-awards-december-6-2025) of [events](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-speech-kennedy-center-awards-dinner-state-department-december-6-2025/) related to the awards show he controlled. That dovetailed with his micromanagement of a [ballroom project](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-taps-new-ballroom-architect-for-300-million-white-house-vanity-project) and his proud acceptance of a [fake “peace prize.”](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/fifa-rewards-trump-with-a-new-hastily-arranged-entirely-unwarranted-peace-prize)

The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has also, just in recent days, focused his attention on [bathroom remodeling](https://newrepublic.com/post/204078/trump-white-house-bathroom-renovation), [guest selection](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115672630683376515) on cable news programs, [golf course design](https://apnews.com/article/trump-andrews-golf-course-renovation-jack-nicklaus-1e5e9bc2e791a094e91f6c4cedb79779), the [genetics of an NFL quarterback](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115604342260009397) and renovating [the Reflecting Pool](https://newrepublic.com/post/203747/donald-trump-threatens-renovation-reflecting-pool) alongside the [Lincoln Memorial](https://www.nps.gov/linc/index.htm).

All the while, on matters of substance, [President Bystander](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/president-bystander-stumped-asked-pardon-signed-hours-earlier-rcna239579) has expressed indifference to affairs of state, leaving observers to wonder who, exactly, is calling the shots in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) while [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) pursues his many self-indulgent distractions, playing in the world’s most powerful sandbox.

[Politico](https://www.politico.com/)’s [Jonathan Martin noted](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/12/04/trump-presidency-child-renovations-entertainment-attention-00676183) last week, “Instead of focusing on governing, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) spends his days chasing entertainment, attention and renovation projects that reflect a presidency stuck in adolescence.”

Watching the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) enjoy himself as the emcee at the [Kennedy Center](https://www.kennedy-center.org/) [Honors](https://www.kennedy-center.org/whats-on/honors/) served as a reminder of the thesis’ accuracy.

As [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) [prepared to pass](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/speaker-johnsons-strategy-epstein-files-transparency-act-fails-spectac-rcna244767) the [Epstein Files Transparency Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/4405) last month, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) published an item to his social media platform, trying anew to distance himself from the scandal. “Don’t waste your time with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/),” [he wrote](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115548539359870302), referring to himself in the third person. “I have a Country to run!”

Left unanswered was the obvious follow-up question: Since when does [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) try to run the country?
