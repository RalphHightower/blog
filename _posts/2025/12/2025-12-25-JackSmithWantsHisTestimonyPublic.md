## [Jack Smith isn’t done pressing Jim Jordan for the transparency the GOP doesn’t want](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jack-smith-isnt-done-pressing-jim-jordan-for-the-transparency-the-gop-doesnt-want)

*In theory, the special counsel is eager to give [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) what they're looking for. In practice, it's not that simple.*

Former special counsel [Jack Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) invested time and effort into advocating for the public to see his testimony last week before the [House Judiciary Committee](https://judiciary.house.gov/), but to no avail: The panel’s far-right chair, [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Jim Jordan (T-OH4)](https://jordan.house.gov/), [rejected calls for transparency](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jim-jordan-jack-smith-testimony-hidden-public), preferring secrecy to sunlight.

The prosecutor isn’t letting this go. [Politico reported](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/19/jack-smith-jim-jordan-trump-00699653):

> *After appearing in a closed-door deposition with the [House Judiciary Committee](https://judiciary.house.gov/) earlier this week, [Jack Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith), the former special counsel who led the criminal cases against [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), still wants the chance to defend his work in a public hearing — and defend himself against continued [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) attacks.*

> *Attorneys for [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) are pressing for their client to be allowed to testify in an open forum in a new letter to [House Judiciary Chair](http://judiciary.house.gov/the-committee/the-chairman) [Jim Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/), obtained first by [POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/).*

The former special counsel appeared before the [Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/)-led committee [for more than eight hours last week](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jim-jordan-jack-smith-testimony-hidden-public), and while the public hasn’t seen or heard a word of what transpired behind closed doors [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith)’s efforts notwithstanding), the Q&A was recorded and transcribed.

The prosecutor’s lawyers are now requesting that the public be allowed to see that hearing, while simultaneously asking for a separate hearing on the same subject that Americans can watch live.

In theory, this sounds like what [Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/) and other [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s are supposed to want. [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) lawmakers have been eager, if not desperate, to generate interest in their investigation, their expansive conspiracy theories about the criminal investigations into [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), and their interest in [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) in particular, whom the party has gone out of its way to [smear in ugly terms](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jack-smiths-closed-door-qa-with-lawmakers-creates-risks-and-opportunities).

An opportunity to show [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s pressing the former special counsel for answers seems like the sort of thing [Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/) and the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) should jump on.

But they’re not. Indeed, [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) have thus far refused to comment on why they’re suddenly so determined to keep this information under wraps.

Except that we know the answer, just as we also know why [Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/) is so reluctant to say it out loud. [The New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/12/03/us/trump-news/c665b349-d12c-56d9-a879-456e05554314?smid=url-share) earlier this month that [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) were “reluctant to give \[[Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith)] a prime public platform out of concern that he could embarrass [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) by making a compelling case for the indictments over the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s attempt to overturn the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf) and his retention of classified documents.”

That is, the point of the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) hearing was to try to trip up the former special counsel, not to offer him a legitimate opportunity to present evidence and tell inconvenient truths that the party prefers to keep from the public.

After the committee heard directly from [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) and saw him testify as to [the seriousness of the evidence he’d compiled against the president](https://www.ms.now/wp-admin/post.php?post=1129481&action=edit), [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Jamie Raskin (D-MD8)](https://raskin.house.gov/), the top [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) on the [Judiciary Committee](https://judiciary.house.gov/), joked that [Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/) “made an excellent decision in not allowing [Jack Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) to testify publicly, because had he done so, it would have been absolutely devastating to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and all the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s men involved in the insurrectionary activities of Jan. 6.”

The former special counsel and his attorneys can keep asking, but at this point, it’s likely that [Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/) and his [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) colleagues will never allow Americans to see [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) to testify. I wouldn’t be too surprised if some in the party are regretting having asked the prosecutor to answer their questions in the first place.
