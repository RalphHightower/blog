## [Jack Smith pushes House committee to release full video of his testimony](https://www.ms.now/news/jack-smith-pushes-house-committee-to-release-full-video-of-his-testimony)

*[Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith)’s attorneys argue that the immediate release of the recording will offer full transparency to the public.*

Former special counsel [Jack Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) is requesting that his full closed-door deposition be immediately released to the public.

[Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith)’s attorneys [sent a letter](https://bsky.app/profile/kylegriffin1.bsky.social/post/3maqxoftszc2q) to [House Judiciary Committee](https://judiciary.house.gov/) [Chair](http://judiciary.house.gov/the-committee/the-chairman) [Jim Jordan (T-OH4)](https://jordan.house.gov/) last week asking for the recording of his roughly nine-hour testimony to be promptly and publicly released.

“Doing so will ensure that the American people can hear the facts directly from [Mr. Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith), rather than through second-hand accounts,” [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith)’s lawyers [Lanny A. Breuer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lanny-breuer-505018a8/) and Peter Koski argued.

[Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) was [subpoenaed](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jack-smith-isnt-done-pressing-jim-jordan-for-the-transparency-the-gop-doesnt-want) to testify before [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) about [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s alleged mishandling and retention of classified materials, as well as the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s actions related to efforts to overturn the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf). During his Dec. 18 deposition, [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) defended his decision to bring those charges against [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).

In the letter, [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith)’s attorneys also reiterated their demand that their client be allowed to testify in an open forum. [Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/) refused [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith)’s [previous requests](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jim-jordan-jack-smith-testimony-hidden-public) to hold a public hearing.

“During the investigation of [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), [Mr. Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) steadfastly followed [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) policies, observed all legal requirements, and took actions based on the facts and the law. He stands by his decisions,” the letter said.

Meanwhile, in [Florida](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) this week, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-appointed [Judge Aileen Cannon denied a motion](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/aileen-cannon-trump-classified-documents-case-report) that sought the release of [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith)’s final report on the classified documents case against [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), further denying information to the public about the results of the special counsel’s investigations.
