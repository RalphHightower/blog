title: "No Mention of January 6 During Press Release of Jan 6 Pipe Bombs. But a Lot of Sprains From Self Congratulations"
---

[Pam Blondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/), [Kash Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel), and others at the press conference announcing the arrest of the person that left pipe bombs at the [Democrat Party Headquarters](https://www.democrats.org/) and [Trumpian Party Headquarters](https://www.gop.com/) more than likely sprained their arms by self-congratulating themselves for breaking the five year old cold case. But then [January 6]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}) happened and [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) staged a nationwide manhunt for those that breached the barricades and stormed the Capitol. 

That the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) were able to Crack this case is fucking amazing considering that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/), and [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) has decimated the agents of all that investigated [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) in the 2020 election interference, January 6 insurrection, and [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) classified stolen classified documents case. News reports mentioned that it was a massive amount of data. Artificial intelligence is a fairly recent tool for analyzing data to connect the fots.

## [Following arrest in pipe-bombs case, White House rejects questions about Jan. 6 pardons](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/following-arrest-in-pipe-bombs-case-white-house-rejects-questions-about-jan-6-pardons)

*With a suspect in custody, [Team Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was reluctant to talk about the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s pardons for others convicted for violent [Jan. 6 crimes]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}).*

Dec. 4, 2025, 4:41 PM EST
By [Steve Benen](https://www.ms.now/author/steve-benen)

Hours before the [Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}), someone placed pipe bombs outside [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) and [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) headquarters in [Washington, D.C.](https://dc.gov/) In the nearly five years that followed, an investigation failed to identify a suspect.

That is, until there was a breakthrough. Federal agents [arrested a suspect](https://www.ms.now/news/fbi-arrest-pipe-bomb-dnc-rnc-jan-2021) Thursday morning, taking [Brian Cole Jr. into custody](https://www.ms.now/news/what-we-know-about-the-jan-6-pipe-bomb-suspect). The [Virginia](https://www.virginia.gov/) man, who lives roughly 23 miles south of Capitol Hill, has been [charged with](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/suspect-arrested-january-6-dc-pipe-bomb-case-rcna247308) transporting an explosive device and attempted malicious destruction by means of explosive materials, according [to charging documents filed](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.287327/gov.uscourts.dcd.287327.1.1.pdf).

Those hoping for justice can certainly hope that federal law enforcement officials have the right suspect and can make their case in court. But as the legal process moves forward, there’s a politically awkward question hanging overhead:

What about [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Jan. 6]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}) [pardons](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/granting-pardons-and-commutation-of-sentences-for-certain-offenses-relating-to-the-events-at-or-near-the-united-states-capitol-on-january-6-2021/)?

At a press conference at the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/), [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) was asked about the obvious tension between Cole’s arrest and the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s decision to pardon every other person convicted for crimes on [Jan. 6]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}), including felons, many of whom violently clashed with police officers.

[Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) dodged the question.

The line of inquiry, however, is entirely legitimate. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), just hours into his second term, [came to the assistance of Jan. 6 criminals](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-concocts-brand-new-lie-justify-pardons-jan-6-criminals-rcna191511), insisting at the time that it would be a “grave national injustice” to hold them accountable.

When [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/) posed the question to the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), spokesperson Abigail Jackson responded with this statement:

> **It’s alarming and insulting that Fake News NBC would compare an individual who placed live bombs throughout DC to the countless individuals who were over-prosecuted and targeted by a weaponized [Biden DOJ](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/). This false equivalence is one of the many reasons why trust in the media is at an all-time low.**

Let’s unpack this a bit.

First, [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/) isn’t “fake.” Second, [Jan. 6 felons]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}) were, if anything, [under-prosecuted](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/09/judge-feds-lenient-jan-6-503052). Third, if [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) have any evidence of the [Biden-era](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) having been “weaponized,” the party [the party has kept its proof well hidden](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/josh-hawley-weaponization-joe-biden-rcna236465).

Fourth, if placing “live bombs” is qualitatively different from other [Jan. 6 crimes]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}), why did the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) [dismiss charges](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/30/nx-s1-5276336/donald-trump-jan-6-rape-assault-pardons-rioters) against Daniel Ball — [who set off an explosive device in a Capitol tunnel](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/florida-man-charged-setting-explosive-device-jan-6-rcna82564) during a fierce battle between pro-[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) rioters and law enforcement officers?

This whole disingenuous mess is among the many reasons why trust in [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his team is at an all-time low.

Time will tell what, if anything, comes of the case against Cole, but before anyone at the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) sticks their neck out, it’s worth noting that a week before Inauguration Day 2025, then-[Vice President-elect JD Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) [told a national television audience](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/pardons-jan-6-criminals-jd-vance-explaining-rcna188517) that those who committed acts of violence on [Jan. 6]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}) “obviously” didn’t deserve pardons.

The [Ohio Republican](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) added at the time that the pardon question was “very simple,” arguing those who “protested peacefully” should be pardoned and “if you committed violence on that day, obviously you shouldn’t be pardoned.”

A week later, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [made Vance look quite foolish](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/pardons-jan-6-criminals-jd-vance-explaining-rcna188517) by pardoning violent [Jan. 6 criminals]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}).

Which is not to say that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) intends to pardon Cole, as well, but this recent history reinforces the fact that the underlying question deserves to be taken seriously.
