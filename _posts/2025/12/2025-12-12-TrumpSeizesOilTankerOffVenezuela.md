## [U.S. military seizes oil tanker off Venezuelan coast, Trump says](https://www.ms.now/news/u-s-military-seizes-oil-tanker-off-venezuelan-coast-trump-says)

*The move ratchets up tensions with the Latin American country in an area where the U.S. has been striking small boats it accuses of trafficking drugs. It’s unclear who owns the tanker.*

The United States on Wednesday seized an oil tanker off the coast of [Venezuela](https://gob.ve/), [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said, sharply escalating tensions with his counterpart, [Venezuelan President Nicolás [Maduro](https://presidencia.gob.ve/Site/Web/Principal/paginas/classPresidente.php).

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) did not immediately offer further details surrounding the ship, including its owner or the nation where it is flagged.

“We’ve just seized a tanker on the coast of [Venezuela](https://gob.ve/). Large tanker, very large,” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) told reporters at the White House, adding that “other things are happening. So you’ll be seeing that later.”

The American military has been destroying small boats the U.S. claims are running drugs off the Latin American country’s coast, though it has offered little evidence to support those allegations. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said Saturday that he intends to [expand](https://www.ms.now/news/trump-boat-strikes-land-drugs-venezuela) the military campaign against alleged drug traffickers from sea to land soon.

Lawmakers, legal scholars and former U.S. military leaders have said the strikes amount to extrajudicial killings, violating both American and international law.
[Maduro](https://presidencia.gob.ve/Site/Web/Principal/paginas/classPresidente.php), whom [the Trump administration has designated](https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/11/terrorist-designations-of-cartel-de-los-soles) as the head of a foreign terrorist organization, has [alleged](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/10/25/venezuelas-maduro-says-us-fabricating-war.html) that the U.S. is “fabricating” a war. He [called the American military presence](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwywjgynyxo) in the Caribbean “the greatest threat that has been seen on our continent in the last 100 years.”

[Venezuela](https://gob.ve/) is a founding member of the [Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries](https://www.opec.org/) and sits on the largest oil reserves in the world. Its fragile economy depends disproportionately on oil exports, meaning Wednesday’s seizure hits squarely on a strategic vulnerability.
