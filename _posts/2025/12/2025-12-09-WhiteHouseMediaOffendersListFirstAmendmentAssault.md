## [I'm on the White House’s ‘Media Offenders’ list — and couldn’t be prouder](https://www.ms.now/opinion/trump-white-house-media-offenders-list-press-freedom)

*The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s attempt to shame journalists for reporting the truth only shows how low [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s energy is these days.*

Dec. 5, 2025, 10:00 AM EST
By Max Burns

Over Thanksgiving weekend, I received a surge in unexpected messages — including many death threats. In short order, I learned that I’d be included on [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s list of ‘[Media Offenders](https://www.whitehouse.gov/media-bias-reporter/max-burns/),’ a taxpayer-funded enemies list on the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s [website](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s latest gambit in rallying the [MAGA](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) base against the [free press](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/). 

My supposed “offense?” A [column for The Hill](https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/5448537-federal-takeover-washington-dc/) that accused [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) of embracing his autocratic fantasies by misusing the [National Guard](https://www.nationalguard.mil/). In a feat of irony only [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) could pull off, the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) didn’t actually refute any of the accurate claims I made in the piece. Instead, it took issue with an accurately sourced file photo that served as the story’s banner image. 

I guess nothing disproves my claim of [Trumpian](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) authoritarianism quite like ending up in the official [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) burn book. Mean Girls, meet 1984.

Like so many things in [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s second term, the [Media Offenders list](https://www.whitehouse.gov/mediabias/) is both troubling and deeply pathetic. A younger, healthier [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) would have taken his anger out on journalists from behind the podium at one of his boisterous, multihour public rallies. Nowadays, the [increasingly insulated](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2025/12/trump-white-house-travel-rallies-isolated/685073/) and [sleepy allegedly ailing president](https://people.com/donald-trump-appears-fight-sleep-during-cabinet-meeting-11860608) outsources the job of voicing his grievances to anonymous web developers. [MAGA](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s political lion is fading into the winter of his days. 

As [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s poll numbers have dwindled to [historic new lows](https://news.gallup.com/poll/699221/trump-approval-rating-drops-new-second-term-low.aspx), so has his patience with the reporters he blames for his staggering unpopularity. Nowhere was that more evident than on [Air Force One]() last month, when [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) casually dismissed a female journalist’s question by calling her “piggy” and demanding she shut her mouth. The [overt misogyny was shocking](https://www.ms.now/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-quiet-piggy-gender-slur-misogyny-rcna245012) even by [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s standards, but it took him only a few days to outdo himself. Less than a week later, he again made headlines by asking [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/) chief [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) correspondent Nancy Cordes, “Are you stupid?” 

What the public sees in [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s outbursts is just the tip of an iceberg that is reshaping how reporters do their jobs in official [Washington](https://dc.gov/). Back in October, [Defense](https://www.defense.gov/) [Secretary Pete Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) [stripped credentials from dozens of Pentagon reporters](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/five-major-broadcast-networks-say-will-not-sign-new-pentagon-press-pol-rcna237526) after their outlets — including [Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/)’s former employer [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) — refused to sign a loyalty pledge that violated every ethical tenet of independent journalism. In their place came a wave of pro-[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) sycophants including conspiracy theorist [Laura Loomer](https://www.loomered.com/), who last month [received her own desk](https://www.mediaite.com/media/news/a-picture-is-worth-1000-words-the-internet-reacts-to-laura-loomer-getting-a-desk-at-the-pentagon/) at the [Pentagon](https://www.jcs.mil/). [Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) won’t need to walk far to ensure his propaganda reaches [Loomer](https://www.loomered.com/)’s 1.8 million [X](https://x.com/) followers.

Like so many things in [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s second term, the [Media Offenders list](https://www.whitehouse.gov/mediabias/) is both troubling and deeply pathetic.

It’s a sign of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s growing laziness that he can’t even be bothered to take mild criticism from [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) in exchange for hours of glowing coverage. Now the praise must be total, even if that means ransacking the [Pentagon](https://www.jcs.mil/) press corps and replacing them with activist-influencers more famous for locking themselves to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/)’s front door than for producing any meaningful journalism. Is it any surprise that even some of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s close allies now worry he’s [dangerously out of touch with reality](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2025/12/trump-white-house-travel-rallies-isolated/685073/)?

The damage isn’t confined to the [Pentagon](https://www.jcs.mil/). [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) recently announced that reporters with the [White House Press Corps](https://whca.press/) would [no longer have access to “Upper Press,”](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/us/politics/trump-white-house-press.html) a part of the [West Wing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) where reporters have freely roamed for decades. Likewise, Leavitt’s office was now officially off-limits, raising the question of what, exactly, the press secretary is actually doing all day. Those restrictions are more than just an inconvenience; they’re designed to make it even harder for journalists to question [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) officials and confer with sources. 

Some of the press corps reporters who were recently barred from talking to the press secretary now join me on [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s laughable [Media Offenders list](https://www.whitehouse.gov/media-bias-reporter/max-burns/). Others, such as [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/)’s [Ali Vitali](https://www.ms.now/way-too-early), made the list for [correcting Leavitt’s repeated lies](https://www.whitehouse.gov/mediabias/) about the alleged criminal histories of individuals illegally deported by [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/). As with all government blacklists, a journalist’s inclusion is a sign they are doing something right. They are telling the truth.

After years of calling reporters “enemies of the state,” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has finally gone ahead and made a list of the reporters he most fears, and who he’d most like to see fired or silenced — or potentially harassed, threatened and otherwise bullied. Any journalist who finds themselves branded a [Media Offender](https://www.whitehouse.gov/mediabias/) should wear it as a badge of honor. I certainly do. 

Reporting in the digital age can often feel like writing for an invisible audience. It’s easy to feel like your work doesn’t matter. Not only will [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Media Offenders list](https://www.whitehouse.gov/mediabias/) fail to silence the reporters he’s targeting, but it will also ensure we continue to speak truth to power with a sense of renewed purpose. Thanks for reading, [Mr. President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).
