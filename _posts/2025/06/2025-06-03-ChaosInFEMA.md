## [As hurricane season begins, Trump's FEMA chief once again fails to inspire confidence](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/hurricane-season-begins-trumps-fema-chief-fails-inspire-confidence-rcna210569)

*It was a problem when the acting [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/) chief jokingly said he didn't know the [U.S.](https://www.usa.gov/) has a hurricane season, but it wasn't the only problem in his remarks.*

June 3, 2025, 8:57 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) had a credible official leading the [Federal Emergency Management Agency](https://www.fema.gov/). His name was [Cameron Hamilton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameron-hamilton-90854b299/), and he had experience, not only as a [Navy](,https://www.navy.mil/) [SEAL](https://www.nsw.navy.mil/) and former combat medic, but also as the former director of the Emergency Medical Services Division at the [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/).

He was nevertheless [fired last month](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/fema-chief-fired-cameron-hamilton-trump-rcna205676), not because he did something wrong, but because [Hamilton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameron-hamilton-90854b299/) — a lifelong conservative [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) — testified before [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) and told lawmakers that it would be in the public’s interest if [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/) continued to exist. [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), of course, [wants to eliminate FEMA altogether](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/113985962341531654), and so [Hamilton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameron-hamilton-90854b299/), [one day after his testimony](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/09/trump-presidency-news/#link-THSXFS5I6FGMDJSZ54KHQJAHOY), found himself [out of a job](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/fema-chief-fired-cameron-hamilton-trump-rcna205676).

He was soon replaced by [David Richardson](https://www.fema.gov/about/organization/david-richardson), who has no background in emergency management, and who, on his first day as the agency’s acting chief, told [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/)’s staff that he would “[run right over](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/05/09/fema-head-run-right-over-staff/83533958007/?tbref=hp)” anyone who gets in his way. A month later, as [Reuters reported](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fema-staff-confused-after-head-said-he-was-unaware-us-hurricane-season-sources-2025-06-02/), [Richardson](https://www.fema.gov/about/organization/david-richardson) continues to make newsworthy comments.

> *Staff of the [Federal Emergency Management Agency](https://www.fema.gov/) were left baffled on Monday after the head of the U.S. disaster agency said he had not been aware the country has a hurricane season, according to four sources familiar with the situation. The remark was made during a briefing by [David Richardson](https://www.fema.gov/about/organization/david-richardson), who has led [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/) since early May.*

As [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/dhs-says-fema-head-was-joking-said-wasnt-aware-hurricane-season-rcna210534), administration officials didn’t deny that [Richardson](https://www.fema.gov/about/organization/david-richardson) made the comments, though the defense was that the acting [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/) director was joking. A statement from the [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/), which oversees [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/), added that the allegations that [Richardson](https://www.fema.gov/about/organization/david-richardson) was sincere about his ignorance were “meanspirited.”

Among those who actually heard the comments, there was [apparently some question](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/us/politics/fema-david-richardson-hurricane-season.html) as to whether [Richardson](https://www.fema.gov/about/organization/david-richardson) was kidding or not, but either way, this was a curious thing for an acting [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/) chief to joke about two days into hurricane season.

Unfortunately, the alleged “joke” wasn’t the only newsworthy part of [Richardson](https://www.fema.gov/about/organization/david-richardson)’s comments. [The Wall Street Journal reported](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/fema-hurricane-plan-guidance-c5662d2a?mod=hp_lead_pos4), for example, that the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-appointed official also announced that [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/) had scrapped plans to come up with a hurricane-response plan, choosing instead to simply reuse last year’s plan.

By way of social media, the [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/) described the [Journal](https://www.wsj.com/)'s reporting as "[fake news](https://x.com/dhsgov/status/1929878400522420358)," adding, "[FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/) is full-steam ahead with an effective and focused plan to respond to hurricane season, while empowering states to further lead their own disaster response."

But the statement didn't exactly deny the accuracy of the [Journal](https://www.wsj.com/)'s report, so much as it took issue with the newspaper including the word "scraps" in its headline.

It’s also worth noting for context that [Richardson](https://www.fema.gov/about/organization/david-richardson) recently told [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/) officials that he [intended to complete work](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/hurricane-season-nears-trump-administration-struggling-badly-prepare-rcna207277) on the agency’s hurricane-response plan by the week of May 19. Now, if the [Journal](https://www.wsj.com/)'s report is accurate, the new strategy is to dust off the [Biden administration](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/)’s plan and run with it.

And while that might seem like a reasonable solution — especially given the fact that the [Biden administration](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) was competent — it’s not nearly that simple. As the [Journal](https://www.wsj.com/)’s report added, some [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/) officials were “confused” about how the agency could follow the 2024 blueprint “given the agency had already eliminated key programs and sharply cut its workforce.”

All of this comes on the heels of [The Washington Post reporting](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/05/23/fema-disaster-declaration-delays/) that [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/) was already facing a backlog of 19 unprocessed emergency aid requests — and that was before hurricane season began.

What’s more, the broader concerns are not limited to [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/). There are related issues at the [the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/05/11/trump-disasters-noaa-fema-climate-change/), while at the [National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov/), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/) reported this week, “There is a lack of meteorologists in 15 of the regional weather service offices along the coastline from [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) to [Florida](https://www.myflorida.com/), as well as in [Puerto Rico](https://www.pr.gov/).”

The same [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/) report, which has not been independently verified by [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) or [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/), added, that the Miami-based [National Hurricane Center](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/) “is short five specialists.”

To be sure, [The New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/weather/nws-job-cuts-weather-service-hiring.html) that the [National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov/), after having already lost nearly 600 employees in recent months, intends to start hiring additional staff to help “stabilize” the department. What’s less clear is when these employees will be hired, whether they’ll have the necessary experience, how long it will take to get them up to speed, and why the [NWS](https://www.weather.gov/) laid off so many of its employees in the first place.

Looking ahead, Americans might get lucky. It’s possible that the projections are wrong and the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) won’t have to deal with any deadly hurricanes this year — or for that matter, in the coming years. Maybe there won’t be any real-world consequences tied to the administration’s latest moves at [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/), [NWS](https://www.weather.gov/) and [NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov/).

But as the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and [his team](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/) move further away from responsible governing and disaster preparedness, counting on good fortune hardly seems like a wise strategy.
