Lyrics:
Grab your ticket and your suitcase<br />
Thunder's rolling down the tracks<br />
You don't know where you're goin'<br />
But you know you won't be back<br />
Darlin' if you're weary<br />
Lay your head upon my chest<br />
We'll take what we can carry<br />
And we'll leave the rest<br />
Big Wheels rolling through fields<br />
Where sunlight streams<br />
Meet me in a land of hope and dreams<br />
I will provide for you<br />
And I'll stand by your side<br />
You'll need a good companion for<br />
This part of the ride<br />
Leave behind your sorrows<br />
Let this day be the last<br />
Tomorrow there'll be sunshine<br />
And all this darkness past<br />
Big wheels roll through fields<br />
Where sunlight streams<br />
Meet me in a land of hope and dreams<br />
This train<br />
Carries saints and sinners<br />
This train<br />
Carries losers and winners<br />
This Train<br />
Carries whores and gamblers<br />
This Train<br />
Carries lost souls<br />
This Train<br />
Dreams will not be thwarted<br />
This Train<br />
Faith will be rewarded<br />
This Train<br />
Hear the steel wheels singin'<br />
This Train<br />
Bells of freedom ringin'<br />
This Train<br />
Carries broken-hearted<br />
This Train<br />
Thieves and sweet souls departed<br />
This Train<br />
Carries fools and kings<br />
This Train<br />
All aboard<br />
This Train<br />
Dreams will not be thwarted<br />
This Train<br />
Faith will be rewarded<br />
This Train<br />
Hear the steel wheels singin'<br />
This Train<br />
Bells of freedom ringin'

Lyrics:
Last night I stood at your doorstep<br />
Trying to figure out what went wrong<br />
You just slipped something into my palm and you were gone<br />
I could smell the same deep green of summer<br />
'Bove me the same night sky was glowin'<br />
In the distance I could see the town where I was born<br />
It's gonna be a long walk home<br />
Hey pretty darling, don't wait up for me<br />
Gonna be a long walk home<br />
A long walk home<br />
In town I pass Sal's grocery<br />
Barber shop on South Street<br />
I looked in their faces*<br />
They're all rank strangers to me*<br />
Well Veteran's Hall high upon the hill<br />
Stood silent and alone<br />
The diner was shuttered and boarded<br />
With a sign that just said "gone"<br />
It's gonna be a long walk home<br />
Hey pretty darling, don't wait up for me<br />
Gonna be a long walk home<br />
Hey pretty darling, don't wait up for me<br />
Gonna be a long walk home<br />
It's gonna be a long walk home<br />
Here everybody has a neighbor<br />
Everybody has a friend<br />
Everybody has a reason to begin again<br />
My father said "Son, we're lucky in this town,<br />
It's a beautiful place to be born.<br />
It just wraps its arms around you,<br />
Nobody crowds you and nobody goes it alone"<br />
"Your flag flyin' over the courthouse<br />
Means certain things are set in stone.<br />
Who we are, what we'll do and what we won't"<br />
It's gonna be a long walk home<br />
Hey pretty darling, don't wait up for me<br />
Gonna be a long walk home<br />
Hey pretty darling, don't wait up for me<br />
Gonna be a long walk home<br />
It's gonna be a long walk home<br />
It's gonna be a long walk home<br />
Hey pretty darling, don't wait up for me<br />
Gonna be a long walk home<br />
Hey pretty darling, don't wait up for me<br />
Gonna be a long walk home<br />
It's gonna be a long walk home<br />
It's gonna be a long walk home

Lyrics:
There's a blood red circle on the cold dark ground<br />
And the rain is falling down<br />
The church door's thrown open, I can hear the organ's song<br />
But the congregation's gone<br />
My city of ruins<br />
My city of ruins<br />
Now the sweet bells of mercy drift through the evening trees<br />
Young men on the corner, like scattered leaves<br />
The boarded up windows, the empty streets<br />
While my brother's down on his knees<br />
My city of ruins<br />
My city of ruins<br />
Come on, rise up<br />
Come on, rise up<br />
Come on, rise up<br />
Come on, rise up<br />
Come on rise up<br />
Come on, rise up<br />
Come on, rise up<br />
Now there's tears on the pillow, darlin', where we slept<br />
And you took my heart when you left<br />
Without your sweet kiss my soul is lost, my friend<br />
Tell me, how do I begin again?<br />
My city's in ruins<br />
My city's in ruins

Lyrics:
Far between sundown’s finish an’ midnight’s broken toll<br />
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing<br />
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds<br />
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing<br />
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight<br />
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight<br />
An’ for each an’ ev’ry underdog soldier in the night<br />
An’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.<br />
<br />
In the city’s melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched<br />
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening<br />
As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin’ rain<br />
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning<br />
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake<br />
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned an’ forsaked<br />
Tolling for the outcast, burnin’ constantly at stake<br />
An’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.<br />
<br />
Through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail<br />
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder<br />
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze<br />
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder<br />
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind<br />
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind<br />
An’ the poet an’ the painter far behind his rightful time<br />
An’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.<br />
<br />
In the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales<br />
For the disrobed faceless forms of no position<br />
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts<br />
All down in taken-for granted situations<br />
Tolling for the deaf an’ blind, tolling for the mute<br />
For the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute<br />
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chased an’ cheated by pursuit<br />
An’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.<br />
<br />
Even though a cloud’s white curtain in a far-off corner flared<br />
An’ the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting<br />
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones<br />
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting<br />
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail<br />
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale<br />
An’ for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail<br />
An’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.<br />
<br />
Starry-eyed an’ laughing as I recall when we were caught<br />
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended<br />
As we listened one last time an’ we watched with one last look<br />
Spellbound an’ swallowed ’til the tolling ended<br />
Tolling for the aching whose wounds cannot be nursed<br />
For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an’ worse<br />
An’ for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe<br />
An’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
