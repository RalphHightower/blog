Breakups are hard, especially when they play out in the public sphere. Here‚Äôs the tea on what‚Äôs happening between [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and [Elon](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) in their messy spat. 

But in all seriousness, we need to kill the bill.

### [Trump and Musk‚Äôs MAGA allies are using weird man talk to cope with feud](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-musk-truth-social-x-fight-maga-masculinity-rcna211456)

*Some MAGA influencers sought to spin the apparent divide into a positive portrayal of masculine vigor, rather than what it was: a petulant blow-up.*

June 6, 2025, 1:36 PM EDT
By [Ja'han Jones](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jahan-jones-ncpn371241)

As the conservative media ecosystem tries to cope with the fallout from an [apparent feud](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-elon-musk-breakup-doge-jeffrey-epstein-files-followers-rcna211333) between [Donald Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-vs-musk-republican-civil-war-budget-bill-rcna211168) and [Elon Musk](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/elon-musk-joins-important-club-former-trump-officials-ve-turned-rcna211394) ‚Äî over the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/)‚Äôs budget bill ‚Äî some right-wing influencers are trying to spin the spat as nothing more than two macho men in a benign sparring match.

You may not think that two grown men ‚Äî arguably, the most powerful in the world ‚Äî [hurling meme-ified insults, threats and accusations at each another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&pp=ygUiQ2hyaXMgSGF5ZXMgVHJ1bXAgTXVzayBBbGV4IHdhZ25lctIHCQmyCQGHKiGM7w%3D%3D) is an acceptable or respectable portrayal of masculine vigor ‚Äî akin to [Ali-Frazier](https://www.espn.com/classic/biography/s/Frazier_Joe.html) or two ferocious bulls locking horns.

‚ÄúSometimes guys fight. Guys sometimes will punch you in the face, and the next night you‚Äôre having a beer. Sleep with your girlfriend, and you patch things up,‚Äù [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) host [Jesse Watters argued](https://x.com/JesseBWatters/status/1930779858096775399) Thursday night.

Fellow Fox host Sean Hannity compared the barrage of insults [to his bygone athletic days](https://youtu.be/f_AmHBcDJgg?) growing up, saying ‚Äúthere wasn‚Äôt a single day that we played hockey or basketball, football or baseball ‚Äî whatever we were playing ‚Äî where we didn‚Äôt fight. And then we‚Äôd fight, then we‚Äôd become friends again.‚Äù He also described Musk and [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) as two ‚Äúvery strong-willed heavyweights‚Äù ‚Äî as if what we‚Äôre talking about here is prize fighters, not petulant and unstable men.

> *Fellow MAGA influencers, including conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec and right-wing troll Joey Mannarino, chimed in with their own bizarrely anatomical rationales.*

Fellow MAGA influencers, including conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec and right-wing troll Joey Mannarino, chimed in with their own bizarrely anatomical rationales, with Posobiec saying the spat was a model demonstration of direct ‚Äî [or ‚Äúphallocentric‚Äù](https://x.com/JackPosobiec/status/1930724723563913578)‚Äî communication and Mannarino saying this is simply ‚Äú[‚Äúhow men with testicles spar.‚Äù](https://x.com/JoeyMannarinoUS/status/1930672338514681902)‚Äù

Right-wingers love to accuse liberals of teaching what they portray as [toxic or extreme ‚Äúgender ideology,‚Äù](https://carnegieendowment.org/emissary/2025/02/trump-gender-ideology-global-trend-women-lgbtq-rights?lang=en) which is basically their summation for the idea that trans people exist and deserve rights. Meanwhile, many of the loudest voices in MAGA world are out here telling the world that mercurial outbursts, including threats and juvenile insults, are a staple of manhood. Americans ought to keep this contradiction in mind as conservatives try to impose their warped view of gender on the nation.

Thus far, the responses out of MAGA world to the apparent divide between two of their most beloved political figures have ranged from the hypermasculine denial laid out here to [abject sadness](https://x.com/seanmdav/status/1930688849119781129). And while it‚Äôs unclear what, if anything, this spat will mean for Americans, or the passage of a [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) bill seeking deep cuts to federal programs, it is clear that conservative influencers aren‚Äôt enjoying watching all this drama play out in public.

### [Nervous Republicans flee Trump-Elon Musk blast radius](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/nervous-republicans-flee-trump-elon-musk-blast-radius-rcna211254)

*Analysis: [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) lawmakers and operatives said [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) should be scared of getting crosswise with either [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) or [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) ‚Äî a tough task when they‚Äôre fighting each other.*

June 5, 2025, 7:24 PM EDT
By Jonathan Allen, Matt Dixon and Kristen Welker

The bromance may be dead, but [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) worry that an escalating feud between [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and billionaire [Elon Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) could live on, leaving collateral damage in its wake for weeks, months or even years.

The proximate cause is the centerpiece of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s agenda, the ["big, beautiful bill,"](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text) which [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) is trashing publicly and privately. To try to kill the legislation, he has said he will spend money to oust [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) lawmakers who vote for it.

‚ÄúHe does not give a fuck about [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) or the [RNC](https://rnc.org/index.html), or [House](https://www.house.gov/) seats, or whatever,‚Äù a [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) adviser said Thursday in the middle of a social media war between [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk), who had never aligned with the [Republican Party](https://www.gop.com/) until the last few years. The adviser was given anonymity to speak candidly about the blow-up. ‚ÄúHe will blow them up; he will. ... I mean, we already know [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) are going to lose the [House](https://www.house.gov/). [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) will likely be fine, but [Elon](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) does not give a shit about that party stuff."

[Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [lawmakers](https://www.congress.gov/) care a lot ‚Äî especially when it comes to their own [congressional](https://www.congress.gov/) seats and chairmanships, which would be in danger if [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) tried to oust them from power in next year's midterm elections.

In interviews with [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) [lawmakers](https://www.congress.gov/) and operatives with ties to [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/), a clear theme emerged: [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) should be scared of getting crosswise with either [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) or [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) ‚Äî a tough task when they are slinging mud, insults and threats at each other.

In short, other [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) are like the kids caught between parents in the midst of a possibly brutal divorce.

"I'm staying out of it," said [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Don Bacon](https://bacon.house.gov/), who represents a competitive Nebraska district. "There's a good verse in Proverbs: 'Stay out of fights.' I'm staying out of this one."

But [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) allies are taking shots at [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) for his comments about [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and even encouraging [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)to take action against him.

"People including myself are recommending to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) that he pull every contract associated with [Elon Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) and that major investigations start immediately," said Steve Bannon, a [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) adviser in [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs first term and a frequent critic of [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk).

In particular, Bannon said, the South African-born [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)'s immigration status, security clearance, reported drug abuse, relationship with [China](https://www.gov.cn/) and "involvement with attempting to get President Xi to the inauguration" should all receive scrutiny.

#### Getting nastier by the minute

Perhaps it was inevitable that the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-[Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) buddy-trip movie would end ‚Äî how long can the world's most powerful man and its wealthiest man pretend that they aren't in competition? But few in Washington could have predicted that the resulting inferno would consume their professional and personal relationships so quickly.

By Thursday afternoon, [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) was reposting a suggestion that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) should be impeached. In the hours before that, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said he was "very disappointed" with [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) for turning on his signature legislation, which would cut taxes by \$3.7 trillion over a decade and slash government spending by \$1.3 trillion ‚Äî leaving a \$2.4 trillion deficit ‚Äî over the same period.

[Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) and his allies bristled at the suggestion by [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) officials that he was angry because the bill would kill tax benefits for electric vehicles, like those made by [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)‚Äôs [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) company.

[Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) spent \$275 million in the [2024 elections](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/2024presgeresults.pdf), mostly to help elect [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), according to campaign finance records, and [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) rewarded him with a high-profile post as the face of the new [Department of Government Efficiency](https://doge.gov/). The role positioned [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) as the avatar of a push to cut the size and scope of the federal government ‚Äî a role that turned him into a controversial figure as he appeared to revel in firing workers and closing agencies. At one point, [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) wielded a fake chain saw on a stage to illustrate his post as cutter-in-chief.

That all came to an end last week when the two men held a chummy [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) news conference to announce [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)'s departure from the government.

But now, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) says [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) was "wearing thin" as a special government employee and the featured player at [DOGE](https://doge.gov/). [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said Thursday on [Liars Club](https://truthsocial.com/) that the easiest way to cut more government spending would be to cancel federal subsidies for Musk's business ventures.

[Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) fired back by picking at a scab involving the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)‚Äôs [withholding of some documents](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/hyped-release-epstein-files-sparks-anger-disappointment-right-rcna194087) from its hyped release of [records pertaining to Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-epstein-called-epstein-files-say-relationship-rcna161354), a onetime associate of powerful figures ‚Äî including [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) ‚Äî who died in prison after being charged with sex-trafficking of minors. The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has released some new information from those records, but most of it has already been public. [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) posted that the "Epstein files" include [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s name. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and Epstein knew each other, and [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s name appeared on flight records for Epstein's plane, but [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has never been implicated in Epstein‚Äôs abuse of underage girls.

[Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) also predicted the economy would be in recession by the second half of this year as a result of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s policies.

#### The fallout

Just a few months ago, [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) indicated he would put \$100 million into political committees associated with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). That money never came ‚Äî and now, it won't, the Musk adviser said.

In addition, [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) have to worry that vast sums will be used against them if they vote for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s bill.

"It‚Äôs gone," the [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) adviser said of the money once earmarked for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s use. "He's going to go nuclear. He will support [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) if needed; he absolutely will."

[Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) watched Thursday's contretemps with glee.

"This is Christmas," a [Democratic Party](https://www.democrats.org/) operative said in a text message.

But even on a more substantive level, it gave some of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s adversaries hope that his agenda would sink under the weight of [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)'s threats.

‚ÄúThe most important thing that‚Äôs happening here is that [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) is killing this terrible bill. If he‚Äôs willing to do that, then welcome,‚Äù said Simon Rosenberg, a veteran [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) operative. ‚ÄúThis is doing enormous damage to [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). There is no version of this that is good for him. There is nothing here positive for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). He looks weak and feckless; he can‚Äôt control his buddy.‚Äù

That's the view from the left. The view of a [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) operative close to the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) was that the episode underscores [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s independence from [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk), adding a note of optimism that the fight would end with harmony.

"[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is the boss, and there can be only one boss. If anything, this deals a blow to the [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/)‚Äô lame attempts to paint the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) as a puppet of the world‚Äôs richest man," said the operative, who was given anonymity to speak candidly about the two powerful men. "On the other hand, I could see them both back in the Oval bro-ing it up again in a month, as it may be just the art of the deal."

Some [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) strategists said that the damage could be contained ‚Äî but that it's not yet clear whether that will happen.

"It depends on how long it goes and how nasty it gets," said a former [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) campaign adviser who counts congressional candidates among his clients.

[Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Richard Hudson (T-NC)](https://hudson.house.gov/), who chairs the [House](https://www.house.gov/) [GOP](https://www.gop.com/)'s campaign arm and is in charge of protecting [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/)‚Äô three-seat margin in the chamber, said he believes the rift will "blow over."

But asked whether he thought [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) would make up, he just shrugged his shoulders.

### [GOP civil war erupts, as Musk ratchets up attacks on Trump's 'Big, Beautiful Bill'](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-vs-musk-republican-civil-war-budget-bill-rcna211168)

*[Musk](ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)‚Äôs propaganda machine now rivals [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) in its ability to influence the right wing of the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/). That‚Äôs causing real problems for the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).*

June 5, 2025, 2:48 PM EDT
By Chris Hayes

This is an adapted excerpt from the [June 4](https://www.msnbc.com/all) episode of ‚ÄúAll In with Chris Hayes.‚Äù

There‚Äôs a civil war brewing in the [Republican Party](https://www.gop.com/) and it‚Äôs threatening the centerpiece of [Donald Trump‚Äôs](https://www.msnbc.com/donald-trump) legislative agenda: his [one big, beautiful, disgusting abomination of a bill,](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/musk-trump-big-bill-x-post-abomination-rcna210691) which the [Congressional Budget Office](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/cbo-office-budget-analysis-republicans-megabill-worse-rcna210890) says will add almost \$2.5 trillion to the deficit, while depriving more than 11 million Americans of health care coverage in the next decade.

> *To say this is leaving the [Republican](https://www.gop.com=) caucus in disarray is an understatement.*

That bill is now meeting new resistance from far-right members of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/), thanks to the actions of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs one-time wingman, [Elon Musk.](https://www.msnbc.com/the-briefing-with-jen-psaki/watch/musk-melts-down-over-budget-bill-republicans-in-turmoil-over-their-own-bill-240942149850) Shortly after his [DOGE](https://doge.gov/) days in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) ended [in embarrassing fashion,](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/maddow-blasts-musk-legacy-usip-rcna210736), with a literal black eye and reports left and right about [alleged drug use and other weird behavior,](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/us/elon-musk-drugs-children-trump.html), Musk started this week off by declaring war on [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs legislation. ([Musk has denied](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5328672-elon-musk-denies-drug-use-new-york-times/) the reported drug use.)

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but I just can‚Äôt stand it anymore,‚Äù [Musk posted](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1929954109689606359) on his social media platform, [X](https://x.com/), on Tuesday. ‚ÄúThis massive, outrageous, pork-filled [Congressional](https://www.congress.gov/) spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.‚Äù

To say this leaves the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) caucus in disarray would be an understatement. Just days ago, [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Speaker](https://www.speaker.gov/) [Mike Johnson (T-LA4)](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/), who is shepherding the spending bill through [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/), [posted a photo](https://x.com/SpeakerJohnson/status/1928506661922058359/photo/1) of himself riding in style with [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) and [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). But on Wednesday, he said he couldn‚Äôt even get [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) on the phone.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve gotta get it done, and I think [Elon](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) understands the weight of that,‚Äù [Johnson told reporters.](https://x.com/atrupar/status/1930275529858396560). ‚ÄúI hope he comes around, and I‚Äôd love to talk to him this week, and I hope he calls me back today.‚Äù (As of Thursday morning, [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) [told reporters](https://x.com/meredithllee/status/1930643336882237840) they were still playing phone tag.)

Hours after that Wednesday news conference, [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) [posted a call to action](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1930336497208832059) against the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) legislation on [X](https://x.com/): ‚ÄúCall your Senator, Call your Congressman, Bankrupting America is NOT ok! KILL the BILL.‚Äù (In case that was too subtle, eight minutes later, he also posted a movie poster for the [the film ‚ÄúKill Bill.‚Äù](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1930338434415243739/photo/1))

But this is more than just a food fight. Remember, [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) [threatened to primary Republicans](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-elon-musk-primary-republican-ethics-rcna184139) who won‚Äôt toe the MAGA line. Now, the threat seems to be that he could primary [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) [who pass Trump‚Äôs bill.](https://x.com/america/status/1930149240723951627) And so some of those [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) are tying themselves in knots to try to keep both [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) happy.

When [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Marjorie Taylor Greene (T-GA14)](https://greene.house.gov/) was asked about [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)‚Äôs criticism, [she told reporters,](https://x.com/MarioNawfal/status/1930069491091738724) ‚ÄúWell, you know I have to agree with him on one hand. I always love it when Americans are angry at the federal government and express it ‚Ä¶ And so, do I like the price tag of the bill? No. But I want to get off the [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) and [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) CR that this government is currently funding on.‚Äù

At one level, this is a story of two people with enormous egos who were never going to be content as co-presidents. But the deeper story here calls into question the entire [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) enterprise and what [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was using [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) for, which was to make really unpopular cuts across the government.

Cuts that followed the [Project 2025](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/project-2025-trump-executive-orders-rcna189395) playbook and appealed to the most hardcore anti-government extremists in the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) base and far-right members of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/), like the House Freedom Caucus, who want a government small enough to drown in a bathtub.

But as a policy, that approach is substantively disastrous and politically unpopular. It is not even popular with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), who has no qualms about running up massive budget deficits. He told everyone he‚Äôs [not going to touch Social Security or Medicare.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/03/fact-check-president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)-trump-will-always-protect-social-security-medicare/) But he has to worry about pro-austerity [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/), so he outsourced the austerity to [Musk and DOGE](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/elon-musk-leaves-doge-trump-legacy-rcna209823). That way, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) could say to the anti-government vanguard in [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/), ‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt worry about the deficit and the debt or spending, because I‚Äôve got [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) going to town over there. He‚Äôs just going to cut all the stuff you don‚Äôt like, and no one in [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) is going to have to take hard votes.‚Äù

But this was always a dubious play. First, because what [DOGE](https://doge.gov/) was doing was [illegal](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/elon-musk-doge-lawsuit-omb-trump-rcna203829), as many courts have found. Second, [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) wasn‚Äôt actually [making a dent in federal spending.](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/elon-musk-doge-savings-trump-rcna203051). He decimated our international aid budget, but that was never where the big government spending was, contrary to all the lies and false conspiracy theories [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) spread.

Most importantly, [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)‚Äôs activities were [so unpopular](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/elon-musk-popularity-survey-rcna196418) that the American people‚Äôs outrage blew back on [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and the [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/). In [town hall after town hall,](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/watch/gop-members-face-tough-crowds-at-town-halls-over-house-bill-they-are-getting-heckled-240556613568), it became clear that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs play for plausible deniability was a failure. That‚Äôs why I believe the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) didn‚Äôt keep [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) on and why he‚Äôs freelancing now.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs special weapon against party division has always been his [cult of personality.](https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/watch/trump-and-the-dangerous-cult-of-maga-208195653929). When it comes to voting for their own beliefs or voting for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) lawmakers almost always vote for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). That was enough to get the bill through the House.

> *This is the Frankenstein‚Äôs monster that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) helped create: A guy who has virtually unlimited funds to primary politicians he doesn‚Äôt like.*

But there are Republicans, particularly in the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/), folks such as [Sens. Tommy Tuberville](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/06/04/congress/tuberville-raises-alarms-on-gop-food-aid-plan-as-he-seeks-governorship-00387161) of [Alabama](https://www.alabama.gov/), [Rand Paul](https://www.courier-journal.com/story/opinion/contributors/2025/06/04/rand-paul-budget-bill-congress-tax-cuts-debt/84012073007/) of [Kentucky](https://kentucky.gov/Pages/home.aspx) and [Ron Johnson](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/04/ron-johnson-republican-spending-bill-elon-musk-trump.html) of [Wisconsin](https://www.wisconsin.gov/Pages/home.aspx), who are being very vocal about wanting to scale back [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs legislation drastically, to pull it apart or to kill it. And now, thanks to political cover from [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk), senators such as [Tuberville](https://www.tuberville.senate.gov/), [Paul](https://www.paul.senate.gov/) and [Johnson](https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/) may be even more emboldened to resist [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).

This is the Frankenstein‚Äôs monster that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) helped create: A guy who has virtually unlimited funds to primary politicians he doesn‚Äôt like. [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) is giving these [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) cover to rail in the way that they are politically comfortable with ‚Äî and he has a [massive social media platform](https://www.msnbc.com/ayman-mohyeldin/watch/-an-embarrassing-spectacle-how-elon-musk-transformed-x-into-a-political-tool-for-trump-221041221755) that he can use to supercharge the debate, just as he used it to spread [totally ridiculous stories and false numbers](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1884326482161590294?lang=en) and false numbers about what [DOGE](https://doge.gov/) has been up to.

That points to a real danger here: [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)‚Äôs propaganda machine now rivals [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) in its ability to influence and target the right wing of the [Republican Party](https://www.gop.com/). It seems [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is discovering that his oligarchy would be great ‚Ä¶ if it weren‚Äôt for the oligarchs.

As the week got underway, [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and [Elon Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) were pals. At an [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) event, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [sang the praises](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-press-conference-elon-musk-oval-office-may-30-2025/) of his top campaign donor as he officially exited his [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) office, and even handed the billionaire [a golden key](https://apnews.com/video/trump-awards-elon-musk-a-golden-key-for-his-doge-work-as-he-gives-musk-an-oval-office-sendoff-990c689fda3049e894fa370beebb1608) emblazoned with the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) insignia.

A lot can happen in a few days, however.

In a [pair](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114632205177163456) of [items](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114632206992330264) published to his social media platform on Thursday afternoon, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wrote:

> *[Elon](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) was ‚Äòwearing thin,‚Äô I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY! The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate [Elon](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)‚Äôs Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) didn‚Äôt do it!*

It was, to be sure, a serious escalation. [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/trump-musk-contracts-subsidies-budget-cuts-rcna211288), ‚ÄúVarious estimates have been put forward on just how much [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)‚Äôs firms, primarily [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/) and [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/), benefit from U.S. government contracts and subsidies. The [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) [has put the figure at \$38 billion,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2025/elon-musk-business-government-contracts-funding/), with [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/) President and COO Gwynne Shotwell estimating that company alone benefits from about \$22 billion in federal spending. [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/) [has reported](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/elon-musks-us-department-defense-contracts-2025-02-11/) that the true figure is classified due to the nature of many of the contracts [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)‚Äôs firms are under.‚Äù

Less than an hour later, the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) megadonor responded with a remarkable rhetorical volley. ‚ÄúTime to drop the really big bomb: [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is in the Epstein files,‚Äù [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) [wrote on his own platform, X](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1930703865801810022), X. ‚ÄúThat is the real reason they have not been made public." Referencing the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)'s initials, he added, "Have a nice day, [DJT](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)!‚Äù

[Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) [later said](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1930718684819112251) [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/) would ‚Äúbegin decommissioning‚Äù its [Dragon spacecraft](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/05/musk-trump-spacex-dragon-nasa.html) ‚Äúimmediately‚Äù following [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs remarks about his government contracts. Minutes later, he [shared a post on X](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1930719235770359903) suggesting [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) should be impeached.

The trouble began in earnest on Tuesday, when [Musk condemned](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/musk-trump-big-bill-x-post-abomination-rcna210691) the [Republican Party](https://www.gop.com/)‚Äôs domestic policy megabill, the inaptly named [‚ÄúOne Big Beautiful Bill Act.‚Äù](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text) in striking terms, calling the reconciliation package ‚Äú[a disgusting abomination](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1929954109689606359).‚Äù

[Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) [added soon after](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-administration-tariffs-immigration-senate-fema-live-updates-rcna210160/rcrd80664?canonicalCard=true), apparently referring to lawmakers who voted for the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) reconciliation package, ‚ÄúIn November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people.‚Äù On Wednesday, he went further, launching an online ‚Äú[KILL the BILL](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/04/musk-trump-tax-bill.html)‚Äù effort.

Those expecting the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) to return rhetorical fire with over-the-top online missives of his own were disappointed: [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), at least initially, didn‚Äôt say a word. That changed on Thursday, during an [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) event with [German](https://www.bundesregierung.de/) [Chancellor](https://www.bundeskanzler.de/) [Friedrich Merz](https://www.bundeskanzler.de/bk-de/friedrich-merz).

‚Äú[Elon](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) is upset because we took the EV mandate ‚Äî which was a lot of money for electric vehicles ‚Äî and they‚Äôre having a hard time,‚Äù [the president said](https://bsky.app/profile/thebulwark.com/post/3lqur4agqm22l), referring to a ‚Äúmandate‚Äù that does not exist while implying that [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) only opposed the GOP legislation because it‚Äôll affect his car company‚Äôs profits.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) went on to suggest that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) lobbied for Jared Isaacman, the former [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) administrator nominee, adding, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think it was appropriate.‚Äù Of course, that raises the related question of why the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [nominated him in the first place](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/demise-trumps-nasa-pick-different-personnel-failures-rcna210461) if this was inappropriate.

That paved the way for the pi√®ce de r√©sistance: the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) suggesting that his former [DOGE](https://doge.gov/) chief is suffering from ‚Äú[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) derangement syndrome.‚Äù

‚Äú[Elon](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) and I had a great relationship,‚Äù [the Republican concluded](https://bsky.app/profile/factpostnews.bsky.social/post/3lqur7svjlk2b). ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if we will anymore.‚Äù

For his part, the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) megadonor responded to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs claim that he ‚Äúknew the inner workings of the bill‚Äù as it came together, [saying](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1930662301792977094), ‚ÄúFalse, this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) could even read it!‚Äù

He also [discounted the idea](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/x.com/elonmusk/status/1930660788739698878__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!oCMxpN-rGtRzo_ktxRl8cUs3cVA-viwCtz2PHZyy7jisPIaJte13O4Duwf0GpAvBBMt2g0U2xf7pEZqe_tBJ1hk3hjZo4yfNW5NYIp9m51T-KnMiTC25$) that the electric vehicle provisions of the package have anything to do with his opposition, before claiming that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [would've lost in 2024](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5335049-elon-musk-criticizes-trump/) were it not for his massive financial support. ‚ÄúSuch ingratitude,‚Äù [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) added.

There's no word yet on whether the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) will ask for his golden key back.

### [Trump-Musk feud explodes online, turns personal with Epstein comments and contract threats](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-says-disappointed-elon-musks-attacks-gop-spending-bill-rcna211226)

*The world's most powerful man and its richest man are lobbing threats and insults on their rival social media platforms, sparked by disagreements over [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s ["big, beautiful bill."](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text)*

June 5, 2025, 12:29 PM EDT / Updated June 5, 2025, 6:50 PM EDT
By Rebecca Shabad and Alana Satlin

WASHINGTON ‚Äî The simmering tension between [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and Elon Musk [exploded Thursday into a public](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/trump-musk-contracts-subsidies-budget-cuts-rcna211288) brawl between the most powerful man in the world and the richest man in the world, filled with personal attacks and financial threats.

The spat began when the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) criticized the [Tesla CEO‚Äôs recent attacks](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/elon-musk-trump-spending-tax-bill-disgusting-abomination-rcna210690) on the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) policy measure winding its way through [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) ‚Äî which [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has dubbed the [‚Äúbig, beautiful bill‚Äù](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text) ‚Äî and quickly escalated into social media volleys. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) suggested the U.S. government could cut its significant ties with [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)‚Äôs businesses. And [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) shot back, promoting a post that called for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s impeachment and alleging a link between the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and the [late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-epstein-called-epstein-files-say-relationship-rcna161354).

‚ÄúI‚Äôm very disappointed because [Elon](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) knew the inner workings of this bill,‚Äù [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) told reporters in the [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) during a bilateral meeting with [German](https://www.bundesregierung.de/) [Chancellor](https://www.bundeskanzler.de/) [Friedrich Merz](https://www.bundeskanzler.de/bk-de/friedrich-merz). ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very disappointed in Elon. I‚Äôve helped [Elon](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) a lot.‚Äù

The comments ‚Äî and the [flurry](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1930660788739698878) of [online](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1930662301792977094) [retorts](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1930667063313633635) from both men that quickly followed ‚Äî are the latest development in a remarkable break between the two. [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) donated over \$250 million in support of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs 2024 campaign, and after his November win, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) invited him into his administration.

[Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)‚Äôs actions at the [Department of Government Efficiency](https://doge.gov/) ‚Äî instituting mass layoffs, shutting government functions and compiling data across agencies ‚Äî defined the early stages of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs second term, and the two showered each other with praise. But the relationship cooled as [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs priorities shifted to major spending legislation and [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) [wound down](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/elon-musk-leaves-trump-white-house-rcna209636) his time at the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) suggested that [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk), who called the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) bill a ‚Äúdisgusting abomination‚Äù this week, was upset that the bill cut out a tax credit meant to incentivize electric vehicle purchases. ‚Äú[Elon](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)‚Äôs upset because we took the EV mandate, which was a lot of money for electric vehicles and they‚Äôre having a hard time with electric vehicles and they want us to pay billions of dollars in subsidy,‚Äù [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said. ‚Äú[Elon](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) knew this from the beginning.‚Äù

[Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) is the biggest electric vehicle maker in the United States. The company‚Äôs sales have suffered in recent months, reflecting increased global competition and backlash generated by Musk‚Äôs political activities. Since leaving his [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) role last week, [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) has said he is back ‚Äú24/7‚Äù at his companies, including [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) and the major government contractor [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/). [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)‚Äôs stock, however, has stumbled as he‚Äôs ramped up his criticism of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs signature bill. Shares are down more than 20% so far this year.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs comments Thursday are his strongest yet against a man who was once his top campaign donor and one of his closest advisers. [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk), who jokingly referred to himself as ‚Äúfirst buddy,‚Äù officially [left the administration last week](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/elon-musk-breaks-trump-agenda-rcna210746) [a less amicable note.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/doge/elon-musk-says-disappointed-domestic-policy-bill-break-trump-rcna209157).

‚ÄúI was, like, disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decrease it, and undermines the work that the [DOGE](https://doge.gov/) team is doing,‚Äù [he told CBS News during his last few days](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/doge/elon-musk-says-disappointed-domestic-policy-bill-break-trump-rcna209157) as a [special government employee.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/white-house-says-elon-musk-serving-special-government-employee-rcna190520).

The nonpartisan [Congressional Budget Office](https://www.cbo.gov/) [predicted in an estimate](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/gop-bill-trumps-agenda-add-24-trillion-debt-budget-office-says-rcna210749) released Wednesday that the [House](https://www.house.gov/)-passed legislation would add \$2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade.

Reacting to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs comments on [X](https://x.com/), [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) first brushed them off as ‚Äúwhatever,‚Äù before firing off dozens of posts blasting the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) bill and the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) himself.

‚ÄúWithout me, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) would have lost the election, Dems would control the [House](https://www.house.gov/) and the [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) would be 51-49 in the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/),‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSuch ingratitude,‚Äù he added.

[Trump fired back later Thursday](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/trump-musk-contracts-subsidies-budget-cuts-rcna211288) on [Liars Club](https://truthsocial.com/), his rival platform, claiming that [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) ‚Äúwent crazy‚Äù after the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) ‚Äúasked him to leave‚Äù his [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) role. [Trump also suggested](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/trump-musk-contracts-subsidies-budget-cuts-rcna211288) the federal government could sever ties with [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)‚Äôs companies, which have billions of dollars in contracts with the federal government.

In response, [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) claimed that [the president was in what are known as the ‚ÄúEpstein files‚Äù](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-epstein-called-epstein-files-say-relationship-rcna161354) ‚Äî a reference to a trove of documents and files spread across a number of investigations and lawsuits. [The Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-pamela-bondi-releases-first-phase-declassified-epstein-files) released hundreds more pages of documents this year related to the Epstein investigations.

Though [Trump and Epstein knew each other](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-epstein-called-epstein-files-say-relationship-rcna161354), there have been no new revelations about their relationship in any of those files. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has never been implicated in Epstein‚Äôs abuse of underage girls. He denied any wrongdoing, saying in a post last year, ‚ÄúI was never on Epstein‚Äôs Plane, or at his ‚Äòstupid‚Äô Island.‚Äù

Flight logs released in 2021 as part of Epstein associate Ghislane Maxwell‚Äôs trial, however, indicated [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) flew on the plane seven times. The logs don‚Äôt include the ages of the passengers.

The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) responded to [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)'s claim Thursday night with press secretary Karoline Leavitt calling it "an unfortunate episode from [Elon](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk), who is unhappy with the [One Big Beautiful Bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text) because it does not include the policies he wanted."

She added that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) "is focused on passing this historic piece of legislation."

The back-and-forth between [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and Musk included the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) saying, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind [Elon](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) turning against me, but he should have done so months ago.‚Äù Soon after, [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) shared a post that said he would win in a fight over [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) should be impeached and replaced with [JD Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/). ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) posted, quoting that post.

[Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) then [charged](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1930722828481098043) that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs sweeping tariffs on U.S. trading partners would ‚Äúcause a recession in the second half of this year.‚Äù

Steve Bannon, a senior [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) adviser during [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s first term who has clashed with [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) in recent months, called for an investigation Thursday into Musk on a variety of issues and the cancellation of all his government contracts.

The dramatic spat was a far cry from their previously close relationship. Even on [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)‚Äôs last day in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) praised his work leading the [Department of Government Efficiency](https://doge.gov/) and said, ‚Äú[Elon](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)‚Äôs really not leaving. He‚Äôs going to be back and forth, I think.‚Äù

He added, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs his baby, and I think he‚Äôs going to be doing a lot of things. But [Elon](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)‚Äôs service to America has been without comparison in modern history.‚Äù
