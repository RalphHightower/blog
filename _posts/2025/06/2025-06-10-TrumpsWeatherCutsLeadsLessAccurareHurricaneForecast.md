*John Morales, a meteorologist with over 30 years of experience, says the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)'s cuts could leave hurricane specialists "flying blind."*

June 4, 2025, 4:29 PM EDT
By [Allison Detzel](https://www.msnbc.com/author/allison-detzel-ncpn1310186)

As the Atlantic basin enters what experts forecast will be an [‚Äúabove-normal‚Äù hurricane season,](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/noaa-hurricane-season-forecast-above-normal-rcna208640), a Florida weatherman has an unsettling message for locals. [John Morales](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/hurricane-milton-john-morales-meteorologist-horrific-rcna174364), a meteorologist at [NBC 6 South Florida](https://www.nbcmiami.com/), [told viewers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwmmPlw06_0) Monday night that he will no longer be able to accurately predict hurricanes due to the Trump administration‚Äôs drastic cuts to weather and climate agencies.

[Morales](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnmoralestv/), who has over three decades of experience reporting on weather in [South Florida](https://www.myflorida.com/), began the forecast with a clip of his 2019 coverage of [Hurricane Dorian.](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/hurricane-dorian-trump-gave-reality-little-touch-msna1272586) In the clip, [Morales](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnmoralestv/) assured residents that the storm would turn, sparing the state from a direct impact. [Morales](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnmoralestv/)‚Äô forecast proved to be accurate, and [Dorian]({% link _posts/2024/10/2024-10-10-Hurricane1SharpiePresidentDorianConeOfUncertainty.md %}) did not make landfall in [Florida](https://www.myflorida.com/).

After playing the clip, [Morales](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnmoralestv/) said that while he was able to go on television six years ago and ‚Äúconfidently‚Äù tell residents the storm would turn, he did not believe he could do the same this [hurricane season.](https://www.msnbc.com/weekends-with-alex-witt/watch/is-florida-ready-for-hurricane-season-after-potential-fema-cuts-fmr-fema-administrator-weighs-in-240680005755).

‚ÄúAnd I am here to tell you that I am not sure that I can do that this year because of the cuts, the gutting, the sledgehammer attack on science in general,‚Äù [Morales](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnmoralestv/) said.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs cuts have led to massive staffing shortages at [National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov/) offices across [Central and South Florida.](https://www.nbcmiami.com/weather/hurricane-season/john-morales-says-hes-worried-about-2025-hurricane-season-after-nws-suffers-loss-of-staff-and-resources/3626695/). As a result, [Morales](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnmoralestv/) explained, less data is being collected due to fewer weather balloon launches. ‚ÄúAnd what we‚Äôre starting to see is that the quality of the forecast is becoming degraded,‚Äù [Morales](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnmoralestv/) said.

We may be flying blind, and we may not exactly know how strong a hurricane is before it reaches the coastline.

According to [Morales](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnmoralestv/), the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)‚Äôs cuts could also decrease the number of [hurricane reconnaissance mission flights](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/recon.php) flights carried out by the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)](https://www.noaa.gov/). [The agency's website states,](https://www.omao.noaa.gov/aircraft-operations/noaa-hurricane-hunters), ‚ÄúInformation from both research and reconnaissance flights directly contribute to the safety of people living along and visiting the vulnerable Atlantic and Gulf coasts.‚Äù

Without this information, [Morales](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnmoralestv/) warned, ‚ÄúWe may be flying blind, and we may not exactly know how strong a hurricane is before it reaches the coastline.‚Äù

In May, [NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov/) predicted six to 10 hurricanes could hit the Atlantic this season. While the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has dismissed concerns that staffing cuts will impact service during hurricane season, which spans from June 1 to Nov. 30, two sources familiar with the matter told [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/) that the [agency](https://www.noaa.gov/) is already being stretched thin. Around 1,000 people, or 10% of NOAA‚Äôs workforce, have reportedly been cut in recent weeks.

[Morales](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnmoralestv/) ended his forecast by urging viewers to take action, telling those watching at home to ‚Äúcall your representatives and make sure that these cuts are stopped.‚Äù
