## [HUD Secretary Scott Turner is embroiled in an all-too-familiar scandal](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/hud-secretary-scott-turner-renovations-nsf-headquarters-rcna215367)

*[Scott Turner](http://www.hud.gov/aboutus/secretary) is denying claims that [his agency](https://www.hud.gov/) is planning lavish renovations for [HUD](https://www.hud.gov/)’s new headquarters as it evicts [National Science Foundation workers](http://www.nsf.gov/).*

June 26, 2025, 4:53 PM EDT
By [Ja'han Jones](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jahan-jones-ncpn371241)

[Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [housing secretary](http://www.hud.gov/aboutus/secretary) is embroiled in a controversy over ritzy and self-serving renovations he allegedly wants to make at the [Department of Housing and Urban Development](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/hud-weaver-building-brutalist-trump-scott-turner-rcna201930)’s new headquarters at taxpayers’ expense.

No need to pinch yourself. The year is 2025 — not 2018, when then-[HUD](https://www.hud.gov/) Secretary Ben Carson faced backlash [after a \$31,000 dining set was ordered for his office](https://www.msnbc.com/all-in/watch/emails-reveal-ben-carson-lied-about-31-000-dining-set-1186261571974) without the required approval from [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/). He ultimately canceled the order amid media scrutiny.

But in the world of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) scandals, it seems all that is old is made new again: The current [HUD](https://www.hud.gov/) [secretary, Scott Turner](http://www.hud.gov/aboutus/secretary), is now at the center of an oddly similar scenario.

On Wednesday, [Turner](http://www.hud.gov/aboutus/secretary) [held a news conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdctWVC7LQM&ab_channel=HUDchannel) with [Virginia](https://www.virginia.gov/)’s [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [governor](https://www.governor.virginia.gov/), [Glenn Youngkin](https://www.governor.virginia.gov/about/), to announce [HUD](https://www.hud.gov/)’s plans to boot employees of the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/) out of their Northern [Virginia](https://www.virginia.gov/) headquarters to make room for [HUD](https://www.hud.gov/) to move in. As secretary, Turner [taken an odd interest](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/hud-weaver-building-brutalist-trump-scott-turner-rcna201930) in slashing his [department](https://www.hud.gov/)’s budget, cutting its staff and selling [HUD](https://www.hud.gov/)’s headquarters in [Washington](https://dc.gov/).


Earlier this week, the [American Federation of Government Employees](https://www.afge.org/) [claimed that](https://www.afge.org/contentassets/d39b37aa070e4ca38844605a82d3f028/afgel3403_stmnt_us_hud_overtaking_nsf_office_space_2025.pdf) it had been informed that new plans for the Northern [Virginia](https://www.virginia.gov/) building included a host of seemingly lavish alterations:
- “A dedicated executive suite for the [HUD](https://www.hud.gov/) [Secretary](http://www.hud.gov/aboutus/secretary) on the 19th floor.”
- “The construction of an executive dining room.”
- “Reserved parking spaces for the Secretary’s 5 cars.”
- “Exclusive use of one elevator for the [Secretary](http://www.hud.gov/aboutus/secretary).”
- “A space dedicated to hosting the [Secretary](http://www.hud.gov/aboutus/secretary)’s executive assistants on the 18th floor.”
- “A potential gym for the [HUD](https://www.hud.gov/) [Secretary](http://www.hud.gov/aboutus/secretary) and his family.”

“This kind of let-them-eat-cake approach to government is absurd,” the [union](https://www.afge.org/) wrote in a news release. “At a time when they claim to be cutting government waste, it is unbelievable that government funding is being redirected to build a palace-like office for the [Secretary](http://www.hud.gov/aboutus/secretary) of [Housing and Urban Development](https://www.hud.gov/,). The hypocrisy is truly dumbfounding.”

When asked about the claims at his news conference, [Turner](http://www.hud.gov/aboutus/secretary) said: “That’s ridiculous. And it’s not true.”

“This is about the [HUD employees](https://www.hud.gov/) — to have a safe space, to have a nice place to work, to represent the people that we serve in America,” he added.

As far as cringeworthy images of executive branch entitlement go, this story ranks right up there with [Interior Secretary](https://www.doi.gov/) [Doug Burgum](https://www.doi.gov/secretary-doug-burgum)’s office allegedly deploying staffers to bake cookies, which Burgum — similar to [Turner](http://www.hud.gov/aboutus/secretary) — vehemently denies.

It seems we’ll have to take a wait-and-see approach with [HUD](https://www.hud.gov/)’s new headquarters, though the fact there’s speculation at all is arguably a bad look — and one that is only shining more light on the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s ongoing efforts to downsize federal agencies and, seemingly, inconvenience much of the [federal workforce](https://www.opm.gov/).

At the moment, it’s not clear where the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/) employees will end up, but a [General Services Administration](https://www.gsa.gov/) official said at the news conference that the [GSA](https://www.gsa.gov/) will help the foundation find another building.
