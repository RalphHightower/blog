## [Why millions of Americans are joining the ‘No Kings’ protests](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/no-kings-protests-trump-military-parade-rcna212922)

*While the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) hosts a grand parade, we hold a parade of the people.*

June 14, 2025, 6:00 AM EDT

By [Ezra Levin](https://indivisible.org/ezra-levin-0), co-founder and co-executive director of [Indivisible.](https://www.indivisible.org/), [Martin Luther King, III](https://drummajorinst.org/board/martin-luther-king-iii/), chairman of the board of the [Drum Major Institute](https://drummajorinst.org/) and author of “What is My Legacy?” and [Arndrea Waters King](https://drummajorinst.org/board/arndrea-waters-king/), president of the [Drum Major Institute](https://drummajorinst.org/)

[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wants to celebrate his birthday like a king: not with cake or candles, but with a [\$45 million military parade](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-struggle-defend-trumps-military-parade-tanks-prepare-roll-rcna212563) through the streets of [Washington, D.C.](https://dc.gov/) Officially, [the parade](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-military-parade-cost-washington-dc-streets-bowser-rcna210671) is only to mark the [U.S. Army](https://www.army.mil/)’s birthday, not the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s the same day; in reality, the military’s celebration, though long planned, did not include a parade until his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) got involved. On the day the [Army](https://www.army.mil/) was founded to defeat tyranny, [he’s getting a parade](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-threatens-military-parade-protesters-says-dissenters-will-face-h-rcna212282) and using your tax money to do so.

This chilling spectacle pulls us away from the ideal of nonviolence that has paved the way for freedom movements in this country for generations. That’s not freedom. That’s not democracy. That’s not [American](https://www.usa.gov/). So on June 14, we the [people are rising up](https://www.nokings.org/) and declaring that in [America](https://www.usa.gov/), we do not have a king. Across every [U.S. state and territory](https://www.usa.gov/), in cities, towns, and rural communities alike, [millions of us will join the “No Kings” mass mobilization](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/trump-s-protest-suppression-tactic-backfires-as-no-kings-events-mushroom-after-l-a-confrontations-241239109806).

> *[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s power doesn’t just come from his title; it comes from the myth that he’s untouchable.*

The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is using the same playbook we’ve seen in other countries throughout history: concentrate power, crush dissent, target vulnerable communities, enrich yourself, and distract the public with shows of force. He’s moved swiftly to erode the guardrails of [democracy](https://constitution.congress.gov/). He’s attacked the press and [public universities](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.npr.org/2025/04/08/1243384819/trump-threatens-colleges-universities-federal-funding-over-dei-anti-semitism__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!tGv4G2U-gCpV6dfJ7oiJfbGgJ6NgbgsgXEcV2dbPIkct9ie8FQDllzNfAIsZLBMWbT5edgFStnIuRwMxMo_vrg/), purged civil servants, and [ignored court orders](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/23/judges-trump-court-rulings__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!tGv4G2U-gCpV6dfJ7oiJfbGgJ6NgbgsgXEcV2dbPIkct9ie8FQDllzNfAIsZLBMWbT5edgFStnIuRwPJ_imXcg/). He’s slashing budgets for [public services](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.pbs.org/newshour/show/exploring-the-potential-impact-of-medicaid-cuts-in-trumps-big-budget-bill?), moved to erase hard-won victories for civil rights, ordered the hounding of immigrants in schools, places of worship and job sites, and ignored due process while deporting migrants to dangerous foreign prisons.

Now, in the very same week when he dispatches the [National Guard](https://www.nationalguard.mil/) and the [Marines](https://www.marines.mil/) to Los Angeles to silence protesters’ righteous cries for justice in the face of his cruel assaults on our immigrant brothers and sisters, he hosts a grand parade. We hold a parade of the people.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s power doesn’t just come from his title; it comes from the myth that he’s untouchable. That he can say and do whatever he wants, and no one can stop him. But that myth only exists if we let it. Authoritarianism feeds on fear and silence. It survives when institutions go along, and when people give up. Already, too many elected officials, business leaders, and civic institutions have fallen in line.

But since his inauguration, millions of [Americans](https://www.usa.gov/) have rejected [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s myth. Thousands of protests around the country have denounced his authoritarian moves, his attempts to rewrite this country’s history and his moves to destroy our already tattered safety net. And the more people have seen of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s lawless [second term](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/), the less popular he has become.

Now, this Saturday, [Americans](https://www.usa.gov/) everywhere will take to the streets for more than 1,500 protests. From [Washington](https://www.wa.gov/) to [Florida](https://www.myflorida.com/), from to [California](https://www.ca.gov/) to [Maine](https://www.maine.gov/portal/index.html), we come together in this latest instance of sustained resistance to this [power-hungry president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). We’re proud to march together in the tradition of moral resistance laid down by [Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.), and carried forward by generations of freedom fighters, who knew that justice is not inevitable, it takes a movement.

> *Authoritarian moments can feel permanent. But they never are.*

The time for assessing this [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) is over — now is the moment to raise our voices and be heard. Not just to protest this parade, but to affirm something deeper: that power belongs to the people, that [democracy](https://constitution.congress.gov/) is worth defending, that we still believe in a government of, by, and for the people. Inspired by [Dr. King](https://drummajorinst.org/board/arndrea-waters-king/)’s legacy, this mobilization reminds us of his vision of a just, inclusive, and equitable society. A dream toward which we have dedicated our lives’ and urge everyone to stand together in the face of this latest challenge to our fragile [democracy](https://constitution.congress.gov/).

Authoritarian moments can feel permanent. But they never are. They crack when people speak. They crumble when people act. And they collapse when courage becomes contagious. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is counting on our fear. We’re betting on our courage. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wants a crown, but we won’t bow. We will rise.
