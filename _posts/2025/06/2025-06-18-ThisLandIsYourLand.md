## Bruce Springsteen - This Land is Your Land (Woody Guthrie Song)

This land is your land, and this land is my land<br />
From California to the New York island<br />
From the Redwood Forest to the Gulf Stream waters<br />
This land was made for you and me<br /><br />
As I went walking that ribbon of highway<br />
And I saw above me that endless skyway<br />
I saw below me that golden valley<br />
This land was made for you and me<br /><br />
I roamed and rambled, and I followed my footsteps<br />
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts<br />
All around me, a voice was a-sounding<br />
This land was made for you and me<br /><br />
There was a big high wall there that tried to stop me<br />
Sign was painted, said, "Private Property"<br />
But on the back side, it didn't say nothing<br />
This land was made for you and me<br /><br />
When the sun comes shining, then I was strolling<br />
And the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling<br />
A voice come chanting as the fog was lifting<br />
This land was made for you and me<br /><br />
This land is your land, and this land is my land<br />
From California to the New York Island<br />
From Redwood Forest to the Gulf Stream waters<br />
This land was made for you and me

You're listening to the 2021 remaster for Joni Mitchell - "Big Yellow Taxi" originally from the album 'Ladies of the Canyon.' THE REPRISE ALBUMS (1968-1971) will be available on June 25 in 4-CD and 4-LP 180-gram vinyl versions, as well as digitally. Pre-order the CD or LP from JoniMitchell.com to receive an exclusive, limited edition 7” x 7” print of a self-portrait by Joni Mitchell: https://JM.lnk.to/TRA6871ID.

Joni Mitchell released Blue, concluding her prolific four album run for Reprise Records with an album considered by many to be one of the greatest of all time. Its stirring, confessional songs have been celebrated by music lovers and critics alike for decades while inspiring a wide variety of artists as diverse as Prince and Taylor Swift. Even today, its stature as a masterpiece continues to grow. Just last year, the album was named #3 on Rolling Stone’s list of the “500 Greatest Albums of All Time.”

To celebrate the album’s 50th anniversary, Rhino is releasing THE REPRISE ALBUMS (1968-1971), the next installment of the Joni Mitchell Archives series, featuring newly remastered versions of Blue (1971) and the three albums that came before it: Song To A Seagull (1968), Clouds (1969), and Ladies Of The Canyon (1970). In the case of Song To A Seagull, the original mix has been recently updated by Mitchell and mixer Matt Lee. 

The cover art for THE REPRISE ALBUMS (1968-1971) features a previously unseen self-portrait Mitchell sketched during the time period. The collection also includes an essay by Grammy winning singer-songwriter Brandi Carlile, another artist who’s been influenced greatly by Mitchell.

They paved paradise<br />
And put up a parking lot<br />
With a pink hotel *, a boutique<br />
And a swinging hot spot<br />
<br />
Don't it always seem to go<br />
That you don't know what you've got<br />
Till it's gone<br />
They paved paradise<br />
And put up a parking lot<br />
<br />
They took all the trees<br />
Put 'em in a tree museum *<br />
And they charged the people<br />
A dollar and a half just to see 'em<br />
<br />
Don't it always seem to go<br />
That you don't know what you've got<br />
Till it's gone<br />
They paved paradise<br />
And put up a parking lot<br />
<br />
Hey farmer farmer<br />
Put away that DDT * now<br />
Give me spots on my apples<br />
But leave me the birds and the bees<br />
Please!<br />
<br />
Don't it always seem to go<br />
That you don't know what you've got<br />
Till it's gone<br />
They paved paradise<br />
And put up a parking lot<br />
<br />
Late last night<br />
I heard the screen door slam<br />
And a big yellow taxi<br />
Took away my old man<br />
<br />
Don't it always seem to go<br />
That you don't know what you've got<br />
Till it's gone<br />
They paved paradise<br />
And put up a parking lot<br />
<br />
They paved paradise<br />
And put up a parking lot
