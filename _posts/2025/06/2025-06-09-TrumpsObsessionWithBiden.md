## [As Trump targets Biden with new investigation, a Republican endgame comes into focus](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-targets-biden-new-investigation-republican-endgame-comes-focus-rcna211131)

*The overarching question is why [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his allies are intent on investigating his [Democratic predecessor](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/). They've already hinted at the answer.*

June 5, 2025, 9:01 AM EDT / Updated June 5, 2025, 9:03 AM EDT

By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

Donald Trump’s [unhealthy fixation](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/even-easter-message-trump-cant-shake-unhealthy-fixation-biden-rcna202159) on [Joe Biden](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/first-100-days-trump-still-leans-old-foe-joe-biden-rcna201229) [a weird turn](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/joe-biden-secretly-robotic-clone-new-conspiracy-theory-trump-amplified-rcna210332) over the weekend, as the [Republican incumbent](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) amplified a social media message that accused the [former Democratic president](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) of being [a robotic clone](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/joe-biden-secretly-robotic-clone-new-conspiracy-theory-trump-amplified-rcna210332) after secretly having been “executed in 2020.”j

While this didn’t reflect well on the [current president](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s judgment, it did draw some guffaws from observers who marveled at the outlandish absurdities [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has embraced as part of his hysterical campaign against his immediate predecessor. His latest anti-[Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) move, however, was far less amusing. [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/president-trump-orders-investigation-joe-biden-alleged-use-autopen-rcna211058):

> *[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) on Wednesday directed a wide-ranging investigation into former [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) and officials in his administration, accusing his aides of using ‘autopen’ signatures to cover up his ‘cognitive decline’ and assert presidential power. ... The announcement Wednesday directs the White House counsel and [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) to investigate whether anyone ‘conspired to deceive the public about [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/)’s mental state and unconstitutionally exercise the authorities and responsibilities of the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).’*

The [presidential directive](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/06/reviewing-certain-presidential-actions/) to the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) came roughly two weeks after Trump [published an item](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114541915757167539) to his social media platform in which he accused officials in the [Biden White House](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) of having committed “TREASON” as part of a secret plot to “destroy our Country.”

[Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) apparently wasn’t pleased with the developments, issuing a statement that described the investigation as a “distraction” from the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) agenda. “Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn’t is ridiculous and false,” said the [Delaware Democrat](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/).

There is, of course, a degree of irony to the circumstances. After his defeat in the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) spent years insisting that [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) had ordered an investigation into him — an odd conspiracy theory for which there is literally no evidence. Now, it’s Trump who’s doing exactly what he falsely accused his predecessor of doing.

What’s more, it’s not just the executive branch taking the anti-[Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) crusade seriously. [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) are [ramping up](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-administration-musk-tariffs-immigration-russia-live-update-rcna210170/rcrd80708?canonicalCard=true) their [investigations](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/24/congress/jordan-subpoena-biden-capitol-attack-00205815) into the former president — [House Oversight Committee](https://intelligence.house.gov/) [Chair](https://intelligence.house.gov/about/chairman.htm) [James Comer](https://comer.house.gov/) has [even subpoenaed Biden’s personal doctor](https://bsky.app/profile/ronfilipkowski.bsky.social/post/3lqszhyhvc22h) to testify before [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) — as are [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) members of the [Senate Judiciary Committee](http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/).

The broader question is why the party has launched this crusade.

To be sure, there are plenty of possible explanations. I’ve seen some suggest that [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) are engaged in an elaborate act of performative cruelty against a partisan foe as he combats an aggressive form of cancer. Others have argued that the relentless GOP efforts against Biden are designed to keep an unpopular former president in the news, distracting attention from the current president’s controversies, while keeping [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) officials and candidates off balance.

But it’s against this backdrop that some of [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/)’s most antagonistic foes have already made their motivations clear.

Just hours before [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) signed his new anti-[Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) directives, for example, [Comer](https://comer.house.gov/) was quite candid during an appearance on [Faux Business](https://www.foxnews.com/). “If these executive orders were just done and authorized by staff, and Joe Biden’s signature was forged on the autopen as some would believe, then I think the Trump administration is gonna have a pretty good standing in court to get rid of a lot of these executive orders,” [the Kentucky Republican told viewers](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3lqrvgbmfm723).

Similarly, the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/)’s [Ed Martin](https://www.justice.gov/pardon/staff-profile/pardon-attorney-edward-r-martin-jr), the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-appointed pardon attorney, declared this week that [he’s investigating Biden’s clemency actions](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-justice-department-examining-pardons-issued-by-biden-2025-06-02/), which followed the incumbent president’s recent statement that [he’s voiding at least some of Biden’s pardons](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-says-s-invalidating-biden-pardons-claiming-power-doesnt-rcna196671) because, according to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s conspiracy theory, [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) wasn’t competent enough to sign or even understand them.

With this in mind, the endgame is coming into focus: [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his party want to invalidate parts of [Biden’s presidency](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/), clearing the way for, among other things, new partisan investigations into those whom [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) protected, further empowering the [incumbent](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), in the process.

Will any of this work? What will the courts say? Will there be a public backlash against Republicans for focusing so much energy into investigating the past instead of preparing for the future? Will the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) start indicting [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) to satisfy the incumbent president’s political demands? Watch this space.
