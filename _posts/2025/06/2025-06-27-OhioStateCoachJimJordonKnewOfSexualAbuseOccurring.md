## [HBO's ‘Surviving Ohio State’ has Jim Jordan again denying he knew about awful scandal](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/ohio-state-wrestling-richard-strauss-jim-jordan-rcna214849)

*Multiple [OSU wrestlers](https://ohiostatebuckeyes.com/sports/wrestling) say in [“Surviving Ohio State”](https://www.hbo.com/movies/surviving-ohio-state) that when they were subjected to serial sexual assaults by a team doctor, [Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/) wasn’t there for them*

June 26, 2025, 8:51 PM EDT

By Marilou Johanek, veteran [Ohio](https://www.ohio.gov/) print and broadcast journalist

Before [Ohio Republican Jim Jordan](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/jim-jordan-immunity-trump-supreme-court-ruling-rcna160210) became [a polarizing political figure in Congress](https://www.msnbc.com/inside-with-jen-psaki/watch/-pure-projection-and-total-bunk-rep-goldman-blasts-jim-jordan-for-plan-to-target-jack-smith-224177733715) in [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) as a pugilistic performance artist and slavish follower of [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), he was a four-time state wrestling champ and two-time [NCAA](https://www.ncaa.org/) national wrestling champ who, in 1986, brought his talents to [Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/) as an assistant wrestling coach. The 18-, 19- and 20-year-olds [Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/) coached through grueling practices and brutal matches respected his knowledge and skill, and as they put it all on the mat for [Buckeye](https://ohiostatebuckeyes.com/sports/wrestling) glory, they trusted [Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/) to be there for them. On the sidelines. In their face. Through pins and takedowns. Injuries and infractions.

> *The 18-, 19- and 20-year-olds [Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/) coached respected his knowledge and skill, and they trusted [Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/) to be there for them.*

But multiple [OSU wrestlers](https://ohiostatebuckeyes.com/sports/wrestling) say in [the new HBO documentary “Surviving Ohio State”](https://www.nbc4i.com/news/local-news/ohio-state-university/ohio-state-sexual-abuse-documentary-premieres-at-prestigeous-film-festival/) that when they were subjected to serial sexual assaults by the team doctor, Dr. Richard Strauss, [Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/) wasn’t there for them. According to an independent investigation published in 2018, Strauss, who died by suicide in 2005, “sexually abused [at least 177 male student-patients](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ohio-state-officials-failed-act-doctor-abused-177-athletes-over-n1006951)” at [OSU](https://www.osu.edu/) over a 20-year period, including at least [48 men on the wrestling team](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ohio-state-officials-failed-act-doctor-abused-177-athletes-over-n1006951). And several of [Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/)’s wrestlers during his eight-year coaching stint at [OSU](https://www.osu.edu/) have included themselves in that number.

[Multiple wrestlers](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/former-osu-wrestlers-say-jim-jordan-betrayed-shouldnt-house-speaker-rcna119116) say [Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/) (who coached at [OSU](https://www.osu.edu/) from 1986 to 1994) knew Strauss ([who voluntarily retired in 1998](https://news.osu.edu/independent-investigation-finds-ohio-state-doctor-richard-strauss-abused-students-from-1979-to-1998/)) was abusing them and did nothing. Dan Ritchie, who wrestled for [Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/) from 1988 to 1992, [alleges in the documentary](https://www.yahoo.com/news/rep-jim-jordan-knew-shrugged-103627063.html) that the assistant coach directly addressed his athletes about the allegations against Strauss with this crack: “If he ever did that to me, I’d snap his neck like a stick of dry balsa wood.”

In total, [six wrestlers](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/06/politics/jordan-osu-wrestlers-strauss-invs) have said that they had conversations with [Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/) about Strauss’ increasingly abusive groping, fondling, trauma-inducing exams and that he acknowledged their complaints. But in the same way he avoided being pinned down as a wrestler, he has avoided being pinned down by reports from wrestlers who say he didn’t protect him and that they weren’t able to count on him for help.

This isn’t a new scandal. When it broke in 2018, [Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/) immediately disavowed knowing of anything untoward about the notorious team doctor and was adamant that if he had known about any type of abuse, “I would have done something about it.” And, after having suffered no obvious political consequences over the last seven years because of the explosive [OSU](https://www.osu.edu/) story, he responded to the [HBO](https://www.hbo.com/) [documentary](https://www.hbo.com/movies/surviving-ohio-state) in essentially the same way as before: “[Chairman Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/) never saw or heard of any abuse, and if he had, he would have dealt with it,” [his office said in a statement](https://www.wosu.org/sports/2025-06-18/ohio-state-university-jim-jordan-focus-of-documentary-on-strauss-sexual-abuse-survivors).

In 2023, as Jordan was vying to become [House](https://www.house.gov/,) speaker, a former wrestler known only as John Doe, told [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/), “My problem with [Jimmy](https://jordan.house.gov/) is that he has been playing with words instead of supporting us.” That former athlete said, “[None of us used the words ‘sexual abuse’](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/former-osu-wrestlers-say-jim-jordan-betrayed-shouldnt-house-speaker-rcna119116) when we talked about what Doc Strauss was doing to us, we just knew it was weird and [Jimmy](https://jordan.house.gov/) knew about it because we talked about it all the time in the locker room, at practices, everywhere.”

> *[Chairman Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/) never saw or heard of any abuse, and if he had, he would have dealt with it.* <br /><br />A statement from [rep. jim jordan's office](https://jordan.house.gov/)

[University personnel](https://www.osu.edu/), along with multiple coaches, were aware of the abuse as early as 1979, [according to an independent investigation](https://straussinvestigation.osu.edu/) commissioned by [Ohio State](https://www.osu.edu/). What Strauss was doing, multiple students told those investigators, was an “open secret” on campus that seemingly everyone shrugged off. That report found that [22 coaches, 18 student trainers and “five team physicians](https://content.presspage.com/uploads/2170/reportoftheindependentinvestigationaccessible-376071.pdf?10000) and/or Sports Medicine Fellows whose employment at [OSU](https://www.osu.edu/) overlapped with Strauss” told investigators “they were aware of rumors or complaints about Strauss” going at least back as far as the early 1980s and extending at least into the mid-1990s. But no individuals were named in that report.

As the documentary [“Surviving Ohio State”](https://www.hbo.com/movies/surviving-ohio-state) neared release this month, a spokesperson for the [university](https://www.osu.edu/) gave a statement to [WOSU public radio](https://www.wosu.org/) that [WOSU](https://www.wosu.org/) said “expressed deep regret and apologies for Strauss’ actions” but emphasized how long ago the doctor’s abuse occurred. That spokesperson, Ben Johnson, said the university is “[fundamentally different today than when Strauss was an employee](https://www.wosu.org/sports/2025-06-18/ohio-state-university-jim-jordan-focus-of-documentary-on-strauss-sexual-abuse-survivors)” and added, “Over the past 25 years, [Ohio State](https://www.osu.edu/) has made robust changes to its culture and policies to protect students, faculty and staff.”

In the [HBO documentary](https://www.hbo.com/movies/surviving-ohio-state), former wrestlers at [OSU](https://www.osu.edu/) recall the excitement of being awarded full athletic scholarships to a legendary sports institution as naive youths at the top of their game. They are in middle age now and forever scarred by what Strauss did to them and others behind closed doors. The team doctor’s pattern of sexual abuse — from inappropriate genital exams to locker room voyeurism and rape — was bad enough. What made it worse for many who came forward was the cold indifference of the people they say they told.

You expect a coach to have your back. A good one cultivates trust with his athletes not only as someone who knows how to win but also as a teacher of discipline, a model of even-handedness, a confidant of players under pressure, a protector on the field and off.

When the [OSU scandal](https://straussinvestigation.osu.edu/) became front page news, not only did [Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/) deny knowing anything, but one of his former wrestlers said [Jordan reached out to him](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/jim-jordan-accused-of-begging-former-ohio-state-wrestler-not-to-support-reports-of-sexual-abuse/2020/02/12/395e7314-4ded-11ea-bf44-f5043eb3918a_story.html) to discount his brother’s story that [Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/) knew and did nothing about his abuse. That person also said [Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/) had called and pressured other wrestlers to “flip their stories.” It was 2018, and [Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/), a founding member of the conservative [Freedom Caucus](https://freedomcaucus.org/), had just launched bid to replace then-House Speaker Paul Ryan, and the scandal threatened to end his political career.

The scandal didn’t end [Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/)’s political career. He has won three consecutive elections since.

“[Another lie](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/jim-jordan-accused-of-begging-former-ohio-state-wrestler-not-to-support-reports-of-sexual-abuse/2020/02/12/395e7314-4ded-11ea-bf44-f5043eb3918a_story.html),” [Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/)’s communications director told [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/). “[Congressman Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/) never saw or heard of any abuse, and if he had, he would have dealt with it.”

The scandal didn’t end [Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/)’s political career. He has won three consecutive elections since — by his customary 2-to-1 ratio — in one of the most egregiously gerrymandered districts in [Ohio](https://www.ohio.gov/). [Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/), who has never in his more than 18 years in [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) sponsored a bill that became a law, has ironclad job security in this red state. He also benefits from the fanaticism surrounding Buckeye Nation among [Ohioans](https://www.ohio.gov/) who bleed scarlet and gray and would rather not dwell on anything that detracts from the cultlike lore of [OSU](https://www.osu.edu/) as a Midwest-proud powerhouse.

He skated from the [OSU](https://www.osu.edu/) scandal without a scratch or a smoking gun that proves he knew of the sexual abuse that [OSU](https://www.osu.edu/)’s [independent investigation](https://straussinvestigation.osu.edu/) said was ongoing the whole time he was there. If some of Strauss’ wrestling victims are to be believed, [Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/) could have stopped the harm being inflicted upon them.

But [Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/) appears not to be the least bit worried about political repercussions for his reported cowardice.

Why should he? To this point, there haven’t been any.
