## [Trump, FBI’s Patel run with a weird new 2020 election conspiracy theory](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-fbis-patel-run-weird-new-2020-election-conspiracy-theory-rcna213962)

*The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) isn't the only one pursuing baseless ideas about his [2020 defeat](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf): His [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director is unfortunately doing the same thing.*

June 19, 2025, 12:00 PM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

At a [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) event ostensibly about a new flag pole, [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) fielded a question about his [“Gold Card” gambit](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/touting-trump-cards-president-makes-dubious-claims-unveils-weird-new-w-rcna212867), which led the president to deliver [an uncomfortably long and rambling answer](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-white-house-flagpole-inspection-june-18-2025/) about a great many subjects — including [China](https://www.gov.cn/) and license plates.

It was admittedly a little tough to follow, but the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) was apparently referring to a new conspiracy theory about his defeat in the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf), which he continues to pretend that he “won ... by a lot.”

The odd comments came one day after his handpicked [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director, [Kash Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel), published [a related item](https://x.com/FBIDirectorKash/status/1934797478609477704) to his social media account, claiming, “The [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) has located documents which detail alarming allegations related to the [2020 U.S. election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf), including allegations of interference by the [CCP](https://www.gov.cn/). I have immediately declassified the material and turned the documents over to [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Judiciary Committee](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/) Chairman [Chuck Grassley](https://www.grassley.senate.gov/) for further review.”

As part of the same tweet thread, [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) referred the public to [an article](https://justthenews.com/accountability/political-ethics/fbi-gives-congress-intel-alleged-chinese-plot-create-fake-mail) from John Solomon, another [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) ally, who reported on an unsubstantiated claim from an unidentified source about [China](https://www.gov.cn/) producing driver’s licenses to be used in a mail-in ballot scheme.

Those inclined to take any of this seriously should probably think twice. [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/fbi-director-kash-patel-feeds-2020-election-conspiracy-theories-docume-rcna213521):

> *The article [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) promoted mentioned that U.S. [Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/) has seized fake licenses that were arriving mostly from [China](https://www.gov.cn/) and [Hong Kong](https://www.gov.hk/) around the time the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) received the tip about the election plot. According to a [2020 news release](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/local-media-release/over-19k-fraudulent-ids-seized-cbp-officers-chicago) from [CBP](https://www.cbp.gov/), most of the seized licenses ‘were for college-age students,’ a population that has historically sought licenses with fake birthdays so underage students can get into bars and purchase alcohol.*

The [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com) report added, for those who might’ve forgotten, that there’s still “no evidence of widespread or systemic voter fraud affecting the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf),” partisan hysterics notwithstanding.

[Rick Hasen](https://law.ucla.edu/faculty/faculty-profiles/richard-l-hasen), an election law expert, also told [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/) that while [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s post “might feed the MAGA base,” what he was promoting was an uncorroborated story of unknown origin “with no evidence that anything actually happened, and certainly no evidence that any ballots were cast or illegal voters were even registered to vote using state identifications.”
What’s more, [Joyce Vance](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joyce-vance-04ba0521/), a former federal prosecutor and an [MSNBC](https:/%www.msnbc.com/) legal analyst, [noted via Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/joycewhitevance.bsky.social/post/3lrsjgmm7ps2w) that the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) “doesn’t turn over evidence to [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) if they have a viable investigation in the works.”

Or put another way, conspiracy theorists on the right who hoped that this might finally confirm their baseless ideas should probably start lowering their expectations now.

That said, this week’s unfortunate developments were a timely reminder that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) isn’t the only one still embracing nonsensical ideas about his [2020 defeat](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf) nearly five years later: The [director](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) of the [Federal Bureau of Investigation](https://www.fbi.gov/,), who presumably has actual work to do, is swimming in the same misguided waters.
