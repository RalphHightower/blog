Breakups are hard, especially when they play out in the public sphere. Here’s the tea on what’s happening between [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and [Elon](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) in their messy spat. 

But in all seriousness, we need to kill the bill.

By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

As [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s relationship with [Elon Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) imploded last week, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and his [top campaign donor](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) didn’t just throw random rhetorical punches. Their feud included rather specific threats.

In fact, on Thursday afternoon, in the midst of an online volley, [Trump wrote](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/elon-musk-trump-derangement-syndrome-rcna211232), “The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate [Elon](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts.”

At least so far, there’s been no [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) follow-through on this, and for the most part, the intensity of the conflict appears to have subsided. But it was against this backdrop that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) spoke to [“Meet the Press”](https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press-full-episodes) host Kristen Welker by phone over the weekend and added a fresh threat to the conversation. [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-elon-musk-consequences-funds-democratic-candidates-rcna211605):

> *[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) on Saturday said there would be “serious consequences” if tech mogul [Elon Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) funds [Democratic candidates](https://www.democrats.org/) to run against [Trumpians](https://www.gop.com/) who vote in favor of the [Trump Party](https://www.gop.com/)’s sweeping budget bill.*

When Welker asked, “Are you concerned that [Elon Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) could start funding [Democratic candidates](https://www.democrats.org/)?” the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) responded, “If he does, he’ll have to pay the consequences for that.” Pressed for details as to what that might entail, the [Trumpian](https://www.gop.com/) added, “I’m not going to say, but he’ll have to pay very serious consequences if he does that.”

As a practical matter, it was easy to understand why [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) might be concerned about this. Last fall, [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) was the [Trumpian Party](https://www.gop.com/)’s most important megadonor. Indeed, [The Washington Post reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/31/elon-musk-trump-donor-2024-election/) earlier this year that, based on the final available tally, the billionaire spent at least \$288 million to help elect [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and other [Trumpian candidates](https://www.gop.com/) in the 2024 cycle.

It stands to reason that the party would welcome similar investments in the 2026 midterm elections, though last week, while complaining about the [Trump Party](https://www.gop.com/)’s domestic policy megabill — the inaptly named [“One Big Beautiful Bill Act”](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text) — [Musk wrote](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/elon-musk-disgusting-abomination-republicans-congress-trump-rcna210884), “In November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the [American people](https://www.usa.gov/).”

This led to a related social media item in which [Musk added](https://time.com/7291937/elon-musk-new-political-party-the-america-party-idea/), “A new political party is needed in [America](https://www.usa.gov/) to represent the 80% in the middle! ... This is Fate.”

While there’s obviously all kinds of time between now and Election Day 2026, this did not sound like a billionaire ready to write generous checks to his erstwhile [Trumpian allies](https://www.gop.com/).

But there’s a more important dimension to all of this: Politicians, at least in this in country, do not generally warn private citizens — out loud, in public, on the record — that they’ll be punished for contributing to a different party.

In fact, I honestly can’t think of a comparable example to this. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is a sitting [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), effectively telling his top campaign donor that he’s prepared to use the power of his office to impose “very serious consequences” on his former ally if [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) dares to support candidates the [Trumpian](https://www.gop.com/) doesn’t like.

Under normal circumstances, and in a healthy political environment, a threat like this one would itself constitute a significant political controversy.
