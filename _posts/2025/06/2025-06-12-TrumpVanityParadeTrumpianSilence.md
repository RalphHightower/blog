## [Republicans struggle to defend Trump’s military parade as tanks prepare to roll in D.C.](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-struggle-defend-trumps-military-parade-tanks-prepare-roll-rcna212563)

*Many [GOP]() officials appear to have no idea what to say about the president's military parade — and some don't want to attend the festivities, either.*

June 12, 2025, 8:59 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

Around this time eight years ago, [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) attended Bastille Day celebrations in [France](https://www.info.gouv.fr/) in 2017, which the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) apparently loved — in part because it included a military parade along the Champs-Élysées. “It was one of the greatest parades I’ve ever seen,” [the Republican said](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/06/10/trump-military-parade-birthday-june-bush-bastille/84112452007/?tbref=hp) after the event, adding, “It was military might.”

Soon after, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) began pushing for a related display in [Washington, D.C.](https://dc.gov/), which was not an especially popular idea, even among many of his allies. According to multiple reports, [Gen. Paul J. Selva](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Biographies/Display/Article/105043/general-paul-j-selva/), the then-vice chairman of the [Joint Chiefs of Staff](https://www.jcs.mil/), told the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) during a [Pentagon](https://www.defense.gov/) meeting that military parades were “[what dictators do](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/us/politics/military-parade-trump.html).”

There were similar reactions on [Capitol Hill](https://www.congress.gov/), including among [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Lindsey Graham (T-SC)](https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/) [said](https://x.com/mkraju/status/961295569955295239) ostentatious American military parades would likely be “a sign of weakness,” adding that he wasn’t interested in a “[Russian](http://kremlin.ru/)-style hardware display.”

Around the same time, [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [John Kennedy (T-LA)](https://www.kennedy.senate.gov/) [explained](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/john-kennedy-military-parade-not-good-idea), “Confidence is silent. Insecurities are loud. When you’re the most powerful nation in all of human history, you don’t have to show it off, like [Russia](http://kremlin.ru/) does, and [North Korea](http://mfa.gov.kp/), and [China](https://www.gov.cn/). And we are the most powerful nation in all of human history. Everyone knows that, and there’s no need to broadcast it. I think we would show our confidence by remaining silent, and not doing something like that.”

The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s plan [ultimately unraveled in 2018](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/faced-soaring-price-tag-trumps-military-parade-unravels-msna1134586) — though in politics, it’s often tough to keep bad ideas down.

On Saturday, June 14, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) will finally get the military parade he’s long sought, ostensibly celebrating the [U.S. Army](https://www.army.mil/)’s [250th anniversary](https://www.army.mil/1775/). The event will also fall on Flag Day, as well as [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s 79th birthday.

Seven years after [Graham](https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/) said such displays would likely be “a sign of weakness,” the [South Carolinian](https://www.sc.gov/) told [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/) this week that he’s now “okay” with the parade. And while that trajectory was probably predictable given [Graham](https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/)’s broader political evolution, as [HuffPost](https://www.huffpost.com/) noted, many of his colleagues were more reluctant to talk about the event.

They snapped. They stared off into space. They zipped into [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) elevators and smiled as the doors closed with them safely inside. This is how nearly a dozen [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) reacted Wednesday when asked the simplest question: Do you plan to attend [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s military parade in [D.C.](https://dc.gov/) on Saturday, and are you comfortable with its estimated \$45 million price tag?

What’s more, [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) [senators](https://www.senate.gov/) aren’t just loath to answer questions about the military parade, they’re also disinclined to show up for the festivities: [Politico reported](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/10/trump-parade-congress-republicans-00398774) that most [congressional](https://www.congress.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) won’t be in attendance when tanks start rolling down Constitution Avenue, and “those begging off include members of the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) leadership in [both chambers](https://www.congress.gov/).”

As for intraparty criticism, [Graham](https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/) has apparently changed his mind, but other [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) have subtly made clear that they’re not fully on board with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s vision.

“I wouldn’t have done it,” [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Rand Paul (T-KY)](https://www.paul.senate.gov/) [told NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-administration-hegseth-china-nj-primary-immigration-live-updates-rcna211664/rcrd81462?canonicalCard=true) this week. “I’m not sure what the actual expense of it is, but I’m not really, you know, we were always different than, you know, the images you saw in the [Soviet Union](http://kremlin.ru/) and [North Korea](http://mfa.gov.kp/). We were proud not to be that,” [Paul](https://www.paul.senate.gov/) said. (He clarified that he was “not proposing” that that’s the image [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) intends to project, but he’s worried what message the parade will send.)

As for [Louisiana](https://www.louisiana.gov/)’s [Kennedy](https://www.kennedy.senate.gov/), the senator echoed the point he raised during the [president’s first term](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/).

“The [United States of America](https://www.usa.gov%) is the most powerful country in all of human history. We’re a lion, and a lion doesn’t have to tell you it’s a lion. Everybody else in the jungle knows and we’re a lion,” the senator said.

It’s a point [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) will probably never fully understand.
