title: "Under Pressure: Tulsi Gabbard, Director of National Intelligence, Testified That She and Trump Are Simpatico"

## [Under pressure, Tulsi Gabbard claims she and Trump are somehow ‘on the same page’](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/pressure-tulsi-gabbard-claims-trump-are-somehow-page-rcna213737)

*The beleaguered [director of national intelligence](https://www.odni.gov/) is apparently trying to say on the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s good side. It’s not going especially well.*

June 18, 2025, 11:33 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

Things haven’t been going especially well for [Director of National Intelligence](https://www.odni.gov=) [Tulsi Gabbard](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) lately. She recently [fired the leaders of the National Intelligence Council](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/gabbard-fires-wrong-intelligence-officials-wrong-time-wrong-reason-rcna206867), for example, because it dared to produce accurate information [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) didn’t like.

That coincided with reports of a member of [Gabbard](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence)’s team [trying to politicize intelligence](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/leaked-emails-suggest-trump-appointee-reportedly-tried-politicize-inte-rcna208235), the release of [a weird Gabbard video](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/tulsi-gabbard-video-nuclear-war-bomb-shelters-rcna212317) that even [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) found bizarre, reports that the [DNI](https://www.odni.gov/) has been [left out of](https://www.axios.com/2025/06/10/trump-camp-david-iran-gaza-meeting) important meetings and strategy sessions, and a [Politico] report on the degree to which the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has soured on the former congresswoman.

Things went from bad to worse this week when [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was asked for his reaction to [Gabbard](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence)’s recent testimony on [Iran](https://irangov.ir/)’s nuclear program. “I don’t care what she said,” [the president told reporters](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-iran-nuclear-weapon-tulsi-gabbard-rcna213476), referring to his own handpicked [director of national intelligence](https://www.odni.gov/).

Soon after, the [DNI](https://www.odni.gov/) appeared to be in damage control mode. [The Washington Post reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/17/gabbard-trump-intelligence-iran-nuclear-program/2b217428-4b8e-11f0-8fff-262d6ec54ab9_story.html):

> *[Gabbard](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) blamed the media for misconstruing her earlier testimony, asserting that ‘[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was saying the same thing that I said.’ ... ‘We are on the same page,’ she told [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/). Asked for comment, [Gabbard](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence)’s [office](https://www.odni.gov/) referred to those remarks.*

I can appreciate the predicament she’s in. After all, [Gabbard](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence), who was [never qualified to hold this position](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/consequences-tulsi-gabbards-confirmation-come-focus-rcna192099) in the first place, doesn’t appear to be an especially influential voice in the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s orbit right now. Indeed, no [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has ever before said, “I don’t care what she said,” in reference to someone in her role.

But to blame journalists and pretend that she and [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) “are on the same page” is difficult to take seriously.

[Gabbard](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) appeared on Capitol Hill in March and testified — under oath, while reading from [a prepared text that her office published online](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/congressional-testimonies/congressional-testimonies-2025/4059-ata-opening-statement-as-prepared) — that the U.S. intelligence community “continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme leader Khomeini has not authorized the nuclear weapons program that he suspended in 2003.”

Three months later, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) considered the assessment of his own country’s intelligence agencies and then rejected it. [Iran](https://irangov.ir/) is “very close” to having a nuclear weapon, the [Republican](https://www.gop.com=) told reporters this week while dismissing [Gabbard](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence)’s testimony.

That raises all sorts of notable questions — including whose intelligence [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is following if [he has no use for](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-reportedly-shrugs-intelligence-briefings-needs-doesnt-want-rcna206248)
his own country’s assessments — but it’s difficult to see how [Gabbard](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) can credibly claim that she and [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said "the same thing."
