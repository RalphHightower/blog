I recently visited Hiroshima, and stood at the epicenter of a city scarred by the unimaginable horror caused by a single nuclear bomb dropped in 1945. What I saw, the  stories I heard, and the haunting sadness that remains, will stay with me forever.

### [LSD: Effects, Risks, Tips, and More](https://www.healthline.com/health/lsd)

LSD — casually known as acid — is a powerful hallucinogenic drug made from lysergic acid, a fungus that grows on grains like rye. You might also hear it referred to as “dots” or “lucy.”

An LSD high is referred to as a “trip.” Anyone who’s done it will tell you that it takes your mind on a wild ride, though not always a good one.

These trips have been described as everything from a spiritual awakening to a trip to the depths of hell (aka the dreaded “bad trip”).

While it’s been studied for potential therapeutic uses, LSD remains a Schedule I drug in the United States. This means it’s illegal to possess, manufacture, or distribute it.

Generic Name: Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)
Common or street names: LSD is sold under more than 80 street names including: Acid, Blotter, acid, Doses, Dots, Trips, Mellow Yellow, Window Pane, as well as names that reflect the designs on sheets of blotter paper (for example, "purple dragon").

What is LSD?
LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), first synthesized in 1938, is an extremely potent hallucinogen. Hallucinations are when you see, hear, feel, taste, or smell something that seems real but is not. It is commonly called Acid.

LSD is synthetically made from lysergic acid, which is found in ergot, a fungus that grows on rye and other grains. It is so potent its doses tend to be in the microgram (mcg) range. It's effects, often called a "trip", can be stimulating, pleasurable, and mind-altering. It some cases it can lead to an unpleasant, sometimes terrifying experience called a "bad trip".

In the U.S., LSD is illegal and is classified by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) as a Schedule 1 drug, meaning LSD has a high potential for abuse, has no currently accepted medical treatments, and has a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision. However, despite being a Schedule 1 substance, there has been a resurgence of interest in potential therapeutic uses for LSD, such as for the treatment of alcoholism and depression. Studies that conform to modern research standards are currently underway that might strengthen our knowledge on the use of LSD.

LSD is produced in crystalline form and then mixed with other inactive ingredients, or diluted as a liquid for production in ingestible forms. It is odorless, colorless and has a slightly bitter taste.

Active doses for LSD between 0.5 and 2 mcg/kg (100–150 mcg per dose). Its half-life is about 3 hours, but ranges between 2 hours and 5 hours, and the psychoactive effects can last up to 12 hours.

LSD is usually found on the streets in various forms, for example:

blotter paper (LSD soaked onto sheets of absorbent paper with colorful designs; cut into small, individual dosage units) - the most common form
thin squares of gelatin (commonly referred to as window panes)
tablet form (usually small tablets known as Microdots) or capsules
liquid on sugar cubes
pure liquid form (may be extremely potent)
Some people may inhale LSD through the nose (snort) or inject it into a vein (shoot it up). There is no way to predict the amount of LSD that is contained in any form consumed.
