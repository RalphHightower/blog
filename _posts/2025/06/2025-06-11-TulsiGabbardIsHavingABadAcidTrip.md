## Tulsi Gabbard On Her Visit To Hiroshima

I recently visited Hiroshima, and stood at the epicenter of a city scarred by the unimaginable horror caused by a single nuclear bomb dropped in 1945. What I saw, the  stories I heard, and the haunting sadness that remains, will stay with me forever.

## [Even Republicans aren’t sure what to make of Tulsi Gabbard’s weird new video](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/tulsi-gabbard-video-nuclear-war-bomb-shelters-rcna212317)

*The [DNI](https://www.odni.gov/)’s video about nuclear threats was so odd that one [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) [senator](https://www.senate.gov/) suggested that “she obviously needs to change her meds.”*

June 11, 2025, 10:59 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

Four months into her tenure as the [director of national intelligence](https://www.odni.gov/), [Tulsi Gabbard](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) has proven her many critics right with one misjudgment after another. The [DNI](https://www.odni.gov/), for example, [fired the National Intelligence Council’s leadership](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/gabbard-fires-wrong-intelligence-officials-wrong-time-wrong-reason-rcna206867) for presenting facts that the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) didn’t like. When pressed on the Signal chat scandal, she testified under oath about details [that appeared to contradict reality](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/atlantic-posts-full-signal-chat-intensifying-white-house-scandal-rcna198175).

In recent days, [Gabbard](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) has reportedly taken steps to politicize her agency’s inspector general’s office, while exploring ways to turn the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s daily briefing into [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/)-style segments.

But her latest move is arguably the strangest. [Politico reported](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/10/tulsi-gabbard-nuclear-weapons-00396586):

> *[Director of National Intelligence](https://www.odni.gov/) [Tulsi Gabbard](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) warned of a ‘nuclear holocaust’ and chastised ‘warmongers’ for bringing the world ‘closer to the brink of nuclear annihilation than ever before’ in a foreboding video posted to social media on Tuesday. In the three-minute video, [Gabbard](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) details a recent visit to [Hiroshima](https://www.japan.travel/en/uk/inspiration/hiroshima-complete-guide/), [Japan](https://www.japan.go.jp/) to learn more about the aftermath of the U.S. nuclear attack on the city in 1945 during [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II). The video features footage of [Gabbard](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence)’s trip and archival footage showing victims, interspersed with [Gabbard](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) speaking directly to camera about the consequences of a nuclear attack.*

Much of the [the three-minute video](https://x.com/TulsiGabbard/status/1932368919039459348) is unremarkable. [Gabbard](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) reflected on a recent visit to [Hiroshima](https://www.japan.travel/en/uk/inspiration/hiroshima-complete-guide/) and talked about the significance of a nuclear threat in ways that are largely uncontroversial.

But one part of [Gabbard](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence)’s message stood out as ... odd.

“As we stand here, closer to the brink of nuclear annihilation than ever before, political elite and warmongers are carelessly fomenting fear and tensions between nuclear powers,” she said toward the end of the video. “And perhaps it’s because they are confident that they will have access to nuclear shelters for themselves and for their families that regular people won’t have access to.”

So, a few things.

First, the suggestion that we’re currently “closer to the brink of nuclear annihilation than ever before” is difficult to take seriously. I’d encourage [Gabbard](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) to read, for example, any good book about the [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War).

Second, I noticed the DNI didn’t name which “warmongers” are trying to “foment” tensions between nuclear powers — the specifics matter. Who are these nefarious figures allegedly putting the world at great risk?

Third, the idea that the unnamed elite “warmongers” have secret nuclear bunkers seems quite bizarre, even by [Gabbard](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) standards.

In fact, the message was so strange that some of the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [senators](https://www.senate.gov/) who voted to confirm her to her current position — despite her [lack of qualifications](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/consequences-tulsi-gabbards-confirmation-come-focus-rcna192099) and habit of [echoing Russian propaganda —](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/democrats-republicans-congress-worried-gabbard-might-leak-information-rcna181316) made no effort to defend her.

[Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [John Kennedy (T-LA)](https://www.kennedy.senate.gov/), for example, [told Jewish Insider that](https://jewishinsider.com/2025/06/dni-chief-tulsi-gabbard-friendly-fire-republicans-hiroshima-video-john-kennedy/) “she obviously needs to change her meds.” [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Susan Collins (T-ME)](https://www.collins.senate.gov/), who has a flair for classic understatements, added that Gabbard’s message was “very strange.”

Before the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) confirmation vote on the former [Hawaii](https://portal.ehawaii.gov/) [congresswoman](https://www.house.gov/), a variety of former national security officials [urged](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/nearly-100-former-national-security-officials-alarmed-gabbard-rcna183121) senators [not to vote for her](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/26/congress/tulsi-gabbard-kash-patel-fbi-cia-trump-00196055). In hindsight, perhaps the chamber’s [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) members should’ve heeded their warning.

Tim Miller and Sam Stein deep dive into Director of National Intelligence Tusli Gabbard’s wild and ominous social video on nuclear annihilation following a trip to Hiroshima, Japan.

### [LSD: Effects, Risks, Tips, and More](https://www.healthline.com/health/lsd)

LSD — casually known as acid — is a powerful hallucinogenic drug made from lysergic acid, a fungus that grows on grains like rye. You might also hear it referred to as “dots” or “lucy.”

An LSD high is referred to as a “trip.” Anyone who’s done it will tell you that it takes your mind on a wild ride, though not always a good one.

These trips have been described as everything from a spiritual awakening to a trip to the depths of hell (aka the dreaded “bad trip”).

While it’s been studied for potential therapeutic uses, LSD remains a Schedule I drug in the United States. This means it’s illegal to possess, manufacture, or distribute it.

### [LSD (Acid): Effects, Hazards & Extent of Use - Drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/illicit/lsd.html)

Generic Name: Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)
Common or street names: LSD is sold under more than 80 street names including: Acid, Blotter, acid, Doses, Dots, Trips, Mellow Yellow, Window Pane, as well as names that reflect the designs on sheets of blotter paper (for example, "purple dragon").

What is LSD?
LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), first synthesized in 1938, is an extremely potent hallucinogen. Hallucinations are when you see, hear, feel, taste, or smell something that seems real but is not. It is commonly called Acid.

LSD is synthetically made from lysergic acid, which is found in ergot, a fungus that grows on rye and other grains. It is so potent its doses tend to be in the microgram (mcg) range. It's effects, often called a "trip", can be stimulating, pleasurable, and mind-altering. It some cases it can lead to an unpleasant, sometimes terrifying experience called a "bad trip".

In the U.S., LSD is illegal and is classified by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) as a Schedule 1 drug, meaning LSD has a high potential for abuse, has no currently accepted medical treatments, and has a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision. However, despite being a Schedule 1 substance, there has been a resurgence of interest in potential therapeutic uses for LSD, such as for the treatment of alcoholism and depression. Studies that conform to modern research standards are currently underway that might strengthen our knowledge on the use of LSD.

LSD is produced in crystalline form and then mixed with other inactive ingredients, or diluted as a liquid for production in ingestible forms. It is odorless, colorless and has a slightly bitter taste.

Active doses for LSD between 0.5 and 2 mcg/kg (100–150 mcg per dose). Its half-life is about 3 hours, but ranges between 2 hours and 5 hours, and the psychoactive effects can last up to 12 hours.

LSD is usually found on the streets in various forms, for example:

blotter paper (LSD soaked onto sheets of absorbent paper with colorful designs; cut into small, individual dosage units) - the most common form
thin squares of gelatin (commonly referred to as window panes)
tablet form (usually small tablets known as Microdots) or capsules
liquid on sugar cubes
pure liquid form (may be extremely potent)
Some people may inhale LSD through the nose (snort) or inject it into a vein (shoot it up). There is no way to predict the amount of LSD that is contained in any form consumed.
