With the targeted political assassination of Minnesota [Representative Melissa Hortman](https://www.house.mn.gov/members/profile/12266) (DFL-Brooklyn Park) and her husband, Mark, and an attempted assassination of [Senator John Hoffman](https://www.senate.mn/members/member_bio.html?mem_id=1205) and his wife, Yvette, the political rhetoric and temperature needs to be toned down.

Past presidents have sought to heal America after tragedy.

- [Ronald Reagan](https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/) after the [Space Shuttle Challenger](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/sts-51l/) explosion.
- [Bill Clinton](https://www.clintonlibrary.gov/) after the bombing of the [FBI Office – Oklahoma City](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/oklahomacity).
- [George W. Bush](https://www.georgewbushlibrary.gov/) after the loss of [Space Shuttle Columbia](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/sts-107/) on reentry, and the al-Qaeda bombing of the twin [World Trade Centers](https://web.archive.org/web/20010413023920/http://www.panynj.gov/wtc/wtcfram.HTM), the [Pentagon](https://www.defense.gov/), and an unknown target that the passengers brought down before their target.
- [Barack Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) after Dylan Roof tried to start a race war murdering nine parishioners in a mass shooting at the [Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church](https://motheremanuel.com/) in [Charleston](https://charleston-sc.gov/), [South Carolina (SC)](https://www.sc.gov).

However, [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is not a uniter. His political survival depends upon division.

- [Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman, husband killed in attack - Session Daily - Minnesota House of Representatives](https://www.house.mn.gov/sessiondaily/Story/18843)

[House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman](https://www.house.mn.gov/members/profile/12266) (DFL-Brooklyn Park) and her husband, Mark, were fatally shot in their home early Saturday morning.
[Sen. John Hoffman](https://www.senate.mn/members/member_bio.html?mem_id=1205) (DFL-Champlin) and his wife, Yvette, were also shot in their home in a related attack. Walz said both are expected to survive.

### Lyrics – For What It's Worth

Song by Buffalo Springfield

There's something happening here<br />
But what it is ain't exactly clear<br />
There's a man with a gun over there<br />
Telling me I got to beware<br />

I think it's time we stop<br />
Children, what's that sound?<br />
Everybody look, what's going down?<br />

There's battle lines being drawn<br />
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong<br />
Young people speaking their minds<br />
Getting so much resistance from behind<br />

It's time we stop<br />
Hey, what's that sound?<br />
Everybody look, what's going down?<br />

What a field day for the heat <br />
A thousand people in the street <br />
Singing songs and they carrying signs <br />
Mostly say, "Hooray for our side" <br />

It's time we stop<br />
Hey, what's that sound?<br />
Everybody look, what's going down?<br />

Paranoia strikes deep<br />
Into your life it will creep<br />
It starts when you're always afraid<br />
Step out of line, the men come and take you away<br />

We better stop<br />
Hey, what's that sound?<br />
Everybody look, what's going down?<br />

You better stop<br />
Hey, what's that sound?<br />
Everybody look, what's going down?<br />

You better stop<br />
Now, what's that sound?<br />
Everybody look, what's going down?<br />

You better stop<br />
Children, what's that sound?<br />
Everybody look, what's going down?
