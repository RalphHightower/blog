## [Will Trump face another hush money trial after leaving office?](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-hush-money-trial-new-york-federal-court-rcna212359)

*The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s latest [personal lawyers](https://www.justice.gov/) are trying to move his appeal of his New York state conviction to federal court.*

June 11, 2025, 2:59 PM EDT
By [Jordan Rubin](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jordan-rubin-ncpn1301611)

Will there be another [hush money trial](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-hush-money-trial-witness-testimony-takeaways-rcna149542) against [Donald Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-appointed-judges-due-process-el-salvador-rcna212280) after he leaves office?

The possibility is raised by the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov)’s pending appeal, which was the subject of a hearing Wednesday. But the issue at the [U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit](https://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/) wasn’t whether [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [state conviction]({% link NewYork34GuiltyVerdicts.md %}) will be overturned, but where his attempt to overturn it will proceed: in [state court](https://www.nycourts.gov/) or [federal court](https://www.uscourts.gov/), with the president [pushing for the federal route](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca2.c95c060a-7c1c-465e-ad55-c66a4c162941/gov.uscourts.ca2.c95c060a-7c1c-465e-ad55-c66a4c162941.96.0.pdf).

The hearing [left it unclear](https://apnews.com/article/trump-hush-money-trial-new-york-conviction-9defa620ade66158e4e9b12ade3fe778) what the three-judge panel will decide. But regardless of where the appeal moves forward, the [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) can have the last word. And that last word could be that Trump deserves a new trial, based on its [immunity ruling](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-trump-immunity-ruling-ask-jordan-rcna200839) last summer.

> *Regardless of where the appeal moves forward, the [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) can have the last word.*

Before the immunity ruling came down last year, a Manhattan jury [found Trump guilty](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/donald-trump-guilty-hush-money-trial-rcna154272) of [falsifying business records]({% link NewYork34GuiltyVerdicts.md %}), for covering up a 2016 election conspiracy involving [hush money paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels]({% link NewYork34GuiltyVerdicts.md %}). [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s former fixer [Michael Cohen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelcohen3/) paid her to stay quiet during the 2016 presidential campaign about her claim that she had sex with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), which he denied. He won the election.

The [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) [declined to halt Trump’s sentencing](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-trump-new-york-hush-money-sentencing-rcna186952) before he retook the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov$) after winning the 2024 election. Splitting 5-4, the justices said [Trump’s argument](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-hush-money-case-sentencing-federal-court-move-rcna168957) that evidence introduced at the trial violated the immunity ruling can be addressed in his appeal. The majority also cited the fact that he was going to receive an “[unconditional discharge](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/unconditional-discharge-trump-sentencing-hush-money-rcna187044),” a penalty-free sentence as a courtesy to the then-incoming [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov), which he received before taking office again.

Now back in office, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is pressing to undo the [historic conviction]({% link NewYork34GuiltyVerdicts.md %}). He’s represented by new private lawyers because he named his lawyers who lost the hush money trial, [Todd Blanche](https://www.linkedin.com/in/toddblanche/) and [Emil Bove](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emil-bove-0113347/), to top posts in the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) (which is [backing Trump’s removal bid](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca2.c95c060a-7c1c-465e-ad55-c66a4c162941/gov.uscourts.ca2.c95c060a-7c1c-465e-ad55-c66a4c162941.97.0.pdf)).

At Wednesday’s hearing, his lawyer [Jeff Wall](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-wall-65337588/), who was a top [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) lawyer during [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s first term and is now in private practice, sought to persuade the panel that the case should move to [federal court](https://www.uscourts.gov/), while a prosecutor from [Manhattan DA](https://manhattanda.org/) [Alvin Bragg](https://manhattanda.org/meet-alvin-bragg/)’s office said it should stay in state court. More specifically, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s lawyers have [argued that](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca2.c95c060a-7c1c-465e-ad55-c66a4c162941/gov.uscourts.ca2.c95c060a-7c1c-465e-ad55-c66a4c162941.47.0.pdf) he’s “entitled to a federal forum to seek relief based on federal constitutional defenses rooted in structural protections for the institution of the Presidency and the Supremacy Clause,” referring to the [constitutional provision](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/supremacy_clause) placing federal law over state law. [Bragg](https://manhattanda.org/meet-alvin-bragg/) [has argued](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca2.c95c060a-7c1c-465e-ad55-c66a4c162941/gov.uscourts.ca2.c95c060a-7c1c-465e-ad55-c66a4c162941.58.0.pdf), among other things, that the removal issue is moot now that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has been sentenced and that the case should stay the normal course through the state appellate process.

But whether or not [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wins or loses his removal bid — we don’t know when the panel will decide — the [justices](https://www.justice.gov/) can take appeals from [state](https://www.nycourts.gov/) or [federal courts](https://www.uscourts.gov/). If the appeal reaches the [justices](https://www.justice.gov/) again, we know from Trump’s failure to halt his sentencing that the [four dissenting justices](https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/010925zr_2d8f.pdf) (all [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) appointees) were ready to provide him that extraordinary relief. [Chief Justice John Roberts](https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/justices.aspx) and [Justice Amy Coney Barrett](https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/justices.aspx) were in the majority rejecting [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s motion in January, but at least Roberts, who authored the [immunity ruling](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) that [Barrett](https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/justices.aspx) didn’t fully join, could form a majority to side with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) on the merits of his appeal.

Whatever the circuit panel decides on removal, it could be a while before the [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) ultimately decides whether [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s state conviction stands. But whenever that happens, the [justices](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) could say that a new trial is warranted; that, in turn, would raise the question of whether the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov) would have another [hush money trial]({% link NewYork34GuiltyVerdicts.md %}) waiting for him when he leaves office.
