## [On Portland, Trump’s claims are at odds with his own administration’s assessments](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/portland-trump-claims-are-odds-administrations-assessments-rcna236660)

*In [Oregon](https://www.oregon.gov/)’s largest city, federal officials have compiled evidence that discredits the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s hysterical claims about local conditions.*

Oct. 9, 2025, 11:59 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

For months, when [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) talked about deploying troops to the streets of American cities, he focused on massive urban areas with large populations. The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s rhetoric on the subject tended to focus on places such as [Chicago](https://www.chicago.gov/), [Baltimore](https://www.baltimorecity.gov/), [Milwaukee](https://city.milwaukee.gov/home) and [New York](https://www.nyc.gov/).

But in early September, he also raised the prospect of deploying [National Guard](https://www.nationalguard.mil/) troops to [Portland](https://www.portland.gov/), [Oregon](https://www.oregon.gov/), for the most [Trumpian](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) of reasons: He’d apparently [seen something on television](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3ly4mvlitny2i) the night before.

In the weeks that followed, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) began an aggressive public relations campaign, desperately trying to persuade Americans that he was correct about [Portland](https://www.portland.gov/) having descended into a lawless, [Mad Max–style](https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/4918/mad-max-and-the-function-of-cinematic-dystopia). [Oregon](https://www.oregon.gov/)’s largest city, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [told reporters](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-tries-fails-circumvent-court-ruling-unnecessary-portland-troop-d-rcna235843) earlier this week, is currently “burning to the ground.”

A few days later, at the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s weird “antifa roundtable,” the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) kept going, claiming that [Portland](https://www.portland.gov/) is [in “worse” shape](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3m2pgyaisds2t) than the “bombed-out cities” shown in dystopian movies. [He added](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3m2ph7zr3f42e), “I don’t know what could be worse than [Portland](https://www.portland.gov/). You don’t even have stores anymore. They don’t even put glass up. They put plywood on their windows.”

Putting aside the fact that [Portland](https://www.portland.gov/) still has plenty of open stores ([Voodoo Doughnut](https://www.voodoodoughnut.com/) remains alive and well), even [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) officials are making assessments of local conditions that are completely at odds with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s absurd claims. [The New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/08/us/politics/trump-portland-troops.html):

> *On Sept. 27, [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) described [Portland](https://www.portland.gov/), [Ore.](https://www.oregon.gov/), as a ‘War ravaged’ city that was ‘under siege from attack by Antifa’ mobs protesting [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) raids. But here is how federal officers described the scene outside the [Immigration and Customs Enforcement](https://www.ice.gov/) building in southwest [Portland](https://www.portland.gov/) on Sept. 25: ‘low energy.’ The next day the same: ‘low energy.’*

“We ultimately have a perception-versus-reality problem,” [Caroline Turco](https://www.portland.gov/attorney/general-information-and-staff), a lawyer for the city, argued in court on Friday. “The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s perception is that it’s ‘World War II out there.’ The reality is this is a beautiful city and with a sophisticated police force that can handle the situation.”

The [Times](https://www.nytimes.com/)’ report, which has not been independently verified by MSNBC, was based on internal reports prepared by [Federal Protective Service](https://www.dhs.gov/federal-protective-service), a [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) agency tasked with protecting federal buildings. If any federal officials are going to be aware of violence at or near the [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) facility in [Portland](https://www.portland.gov/), it’s the [Federal Protective Service](https://www.dhs.gov/federal-protective-service).

And yet, according to the [Times](https://www.nytimes.com/)’ report, the [FPS](https://www.dhs.gov/federal-protective-service) reports, prepared daily for law enforcement partners, “offered no indication of a dangerous escalation of tensions, or unusual levels of protest activity that would prompt the level of alarm expressed by [Mr. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).”

The body of evidence suggesting the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has manufactured a crisis is growing.
