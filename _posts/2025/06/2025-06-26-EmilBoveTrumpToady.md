## [The Emil Bove whistleblower's report should be required reading for every Senate Republican](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/emile-bove-senate-hearing-trump-rcna215134)

*[Bove](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emil-bove-0113347/) testified before the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) on Wednesday that he never advised [DOJ lawyers](https://www.justice.gov/) to defy a [federal court](https://www.uscourts.gov/) order. A whistleblower claims otherwise.*

June 26, 2025, 6:00 AM EDT

By [Ray Brescia](https://www.albanylaw.edu/faculty/faculty-directory/raymond-brescia), [professor of law](https://www.albanylaw.edu/faculty), [Albany Law School](https://www.albanylaw.edu/)

As key cogs in our legal system, lawyers must follow the core principle that they engage in zealous advocacy on behalf of their clients but stay within the bounds of the law. Over the first five months of [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [second administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/), [Emil Bove III](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/emil-bove-confirmation-hearing-eric-adams-trump-rcna215074), formerly one of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s personal lawyers, has tested the limits of his obligations to the legal system in service of the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s policy goals.

[Trump has nominated Bove for a lifetime appointment](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/emil-bove-trump-doj-judge-nomination-rcna214722) to a federal appeals court. The [Senate will now consider Bove’s nomination](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-wants-make-one-controversial-former-defense-lawyers-appeals-cour-rcna209761). Recent allegations that he gave federal prosecutors instructions to ignore court rulings, if true, suggest he isn’t fit to practice law at all, let alone serve on the federal bench.

> *I categorically reject any claim of unethical or inappropriate behavior by me.* <br /><br />[Emil Bove III](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emil-bove-0113347/) to the [Senate Judiciary Committee](http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/) wednesday, june 25

[Bove](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emil-bove-0113347/), in a confirmation hearing before the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Judiciary Committee](http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/) on Wednesday, denied that specific allegation. “I have never advised a [Department of Justice attorney](https://www.justice.gov/) to violate a court order,” he said. He also said, “[I categorically reject any claim of unethical or inappropriate behavior by me](https://www.npr.org/2025/06/25/g-s1-74064/trump-emil-bove-judge-nomination).”

[Bove](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emil-bove-0113347/)’s main claim to fame is that he served on the legal team that tried but failed to keep [Trump from being convicted of 34 felony counts](https://www.msnbc.com/trump-investigation/msnbc-new-york/live-blog/trump-trial-verdict-live-updates-rcna153629) in Manhattan in 2024. When [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) later rewarded [Bove](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emil-bove-0113347/) a leadership position in the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/), he reportedly gave an order to [Justice Department attorneys](https://www.justice.gov/) in the Public Integrity Unit that a pending indictment accusing [New York](https://www.nyc.gov/) [Mayor](https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/index.page) [Eric Adams](https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/bio.page) of bribery and wire fraud be dropped. [U.S. District Judge](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/judge-dismisses-nyc-mayor-eric-adams-corruption-case-trump-rcna192817) [Dale E. Ho](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/judge-dismisses-nyc-mayor-eric-adams-corruption-case-trump-rcna192817) found that the record “points towards an uncomfortable conclusion: that the decision to dismiss this case was apparently premised on the [Mayor](https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/index.page) taking subsequent immigration-related actions in conformity with the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s policy preferences.”

Now, a [Justice Department whistleblower says Bove](https://www.msnbc.com/the-beat-with-ari/watch/trump-whistleblower-details-lawless-doj-plot-melber-report-242201157797) says [Bove](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emil-bove-0113347/) sought to undermine the federal judiciary’s ability to provide effective oversight of the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s plans to deport certain immigrants without due process of law.

According to a letter to the ranking members of the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Judiciary Committee](http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/), written on behalf of former [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) lawyer [Erez Reuveni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erez-reuveni-5b796b18/), [Bove](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emil-bove-0113347/) told the team defending the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s immigration policies to be prepared to ignore any federal court rulings halting deportations and, according to [Reuveni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erez-reuveni-5b796b18/), consider telling judges “fuck you.”

[Bove](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emil-bove-0113347/) testified Wednesday that he couldn’t recall using that profanity and never advised [Justice Department lawyers](https://www.justice.gov/) to defy a federal court order.

[Reuveni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erez-reuveni-5b796b18/)’s minute-by-minute account of the issuance of judicial orders halting certain deportations, and the corresponding communications within the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) and between federal agencies, paints a grim picture of lawyers’ knowingly defying court orders, making misrepresentations to the court and dragging their feet with the goal of ensuring the deportations could take place without judicial interference. [Reuveni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erez-reuveni-5b796b18/)’s allegations, if true, paint a troubling picture of [Bove](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emil-bove-0113347/)’s behavior as a senior [Justice Department official](https://www.justice.gov/), one that raises serious questions about not just his qualifications for a federal judgeship, but also his fitness to practice law altogether.

Some of his critics, including [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) attorney [Todd Blanche](https://www.linkedin.com/in/toddblanche/), another member of the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) legal team, paint [Reuveni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erez-reuveni-5b796b18/) as a [disgruntled former Justice Department official](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/trump-judicial-nominee-pressured-doj-defy-court-deportations-whistleblower-says-2025-06-24/) who they say was fired for poor performance. Yet [Reuveni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erez-reuveni-5b796b18/) received excellent reviews for over a decade during [Republican](https://www.gop.com/,) and [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) administrations. His main offense appears to be admitting that Kilmer Abrego Garcia, the [Maryland](https://www.maryland.gov/) man deported to a [Salvadoran](https://www.gob.sv/) prison, was wrongfully deported because of an [administrative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) error.

According to the [legal profession’s code of ethics](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/model_rules_of_professional_conduct_table_of_contents/) and [rules governing litigation in federal court](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_11), a lawyer may not make false or misleading statements in court, may present only good faith arguments about the legitimacy of their legal positions, must not encourage others to violate the rules of ethics and must oversee lawyers they supervise in a way that ensures that those lawyers comply with their own ethical obligations. If [Reuveni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erez-reuveni-5b796b18/)’s account of [Bove](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emil-bove-0113347/)’s conduct is true, then [Bove](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emil-bove-0113347/) hasn’t met the profession’s ethical obligations.

> *[Bove](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emil-bove-0113347/) isn’t the first lawyer accused of violating his ethical obligations to promote [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s agenda.*

[Bove](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emil-bove-0113347/) wouldn't be the first lawyer associated with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) accused of violating his ethical obligations to promote [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s agenda. For his false, misleading and even defamatory statements, former [New York](https://www.nyc.gov/) [Mayor](https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/index.page) Rudy Giuliani has been [disbarred in two jurisdictions](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/rudy-giuliani-disbarred-washington-dc-losing-new-york-law-license-rcna172827). John Eastman, the conservative lawyer who would come up with the patently frivolous claim that [Vice President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Mike Pence](https://advancingamericanfreedom.com/) could overturn the results of the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf), has been disbarred in [California](https://www.ca.gov/), [a decision recently affirmed by that state’s highest court](https://www.calbar.ca.gov/About-Us/News/News-Releases/john-eastman-state-bar-court-review-decision-in-disbarment-recommendation-remains). Jeffrey Clark, a former [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) official who urged the department to make false statements to election officials in [Georgia](https://georgia.gov/) regarding the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf) — and asked [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to appoint him [attorney general](https://www.justice.gov/) if [Justice Department lawyers](https://www.justice.gov/) wouldn’t go along with Clark’s scheme — [now faces the prospect of a two-year suspension from the practice of law](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/jeffrey-clark--donald-trump--and-control-of-the-department-of-justice#:~:text=On%20Aug.,resolved%20definitively%20until%20next%20year.).

Elihu Root, a prominent New York lawyer who held several Cabinet positions under Presidents William McKinley and Teddy Roosevelt, [reportedly](https://www.legalethicsforum.com/blog/2009/10/the-elihu-root-quotation.html) opined that “[a]bout half the practice of a decent lawyer consists in telling would-be clients that they are damned fools and should stop.” According to allegations regarding [Bove](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emil-bove-0113347/)’s conduct in his short stint in the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/), specifically his attempt to push [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s deportation agenda no matter what, it seems he hasn’t exhibited the qualities of Root’s “decent lawyer.”

Will such reports sink his nomination? Unfortunately, given [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s hold on the [Republican Party](https://www.gop.com/), that’s hard to say. Regardless, if [Reuveni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erez-reuveni-5b796b18/)’s allegations hold up, [Bove](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emil-bove-0113347/) may well have failed to uphold his most basic obligations as an attorney.
