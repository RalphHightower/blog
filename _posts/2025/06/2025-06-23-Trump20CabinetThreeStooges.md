June 22, 2025, 6:00 AM EDT

By Anthony L. Fisher, Senior Editor, [MSNBC Daily](https://www.msnbc.com/)

During [Donald Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s first run for [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), the sentence [“‘Idiocracy’ was a documentary”](https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/watch/republicans-conservatives-right-wing-extremists-slammed-for-cultivating-culture-of-stupidity-123138629986) was a funny meme. In his [first administration](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/), that reference to the 2006 satire about a bleak anti-intellectual future became a well-worn cliché, losing its comedic punch. In his [second administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/), the movie actually feels so much like a documentary — and so little like satire — that it’s definitely not funny.

We’re almost certainly at an inflection point in world history now that [the United States has directly struck three Iranian nuclear facilities](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/us-attacked-3-iranian-nuclear-sites-trump-says-truth-social-rcna213400) — officially joining [Israel](https://www.gov.il/)’s war, not merely supporting it, and potentially sparking a wider regional conflict. [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) — whose ["America First"](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/america-first-trade-policy/) supporters have long praised him for "not getting America into any new wars" — has now unilaterally [struck a sovereign nation without congressional approval](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/us-bombs-iran-nuclear-sites-trump-rcna214311). And though a small number of [congresspeople](https://www.congress.gov/) are demanding the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) seek the advice and consent of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/), without a major, shocking reset of [Republican](https://www.gop.com/,) priorities, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) may continue making war on his own terms.

> *Those responsible for leading [U.S. military](https://www.jcs.mil/) and [intelligence services](https://www.odni.gov/) are, respectively, a former [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) co-host and a sympathizer of [Vladimir Putin](http://kremlin.ru/) and Bashar al-Assad.*

Just as disquieting is the fact that this [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) — unstable, impulsive, immune to facts, incapable of admitting to a mistake or conceding a failure and currently running a lawless administration trampling on the rights of both Americans and immigrants — is being advised by incompetent, unqualified television personalities and admitted bigots. This is all happening just as the administration has gutted anti-terror programs and intelligence agencies in the name of fighting the “Deep State,” even as it has simultaneously tasked [masked, badgeless secret police](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/ice-masks-california-secret-police-bill-rcna213483) to brutally arrest both citizens and noncitizens with impunity.

Those responsible for leading [U.S. military](https://www.jcs.mil/) and [intelligence services](https://www.odni.gov/) are, respectively, a former [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) co-host and a sympathizer of [Vladimir Putin](http://kremlin.ru/) and Bashar al-Assad. Try to imagine [Pete Hegseth](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/not-serious-person-pete-hegseth-hedges-congress-honoring-court-rulings-rcna213797), [whose department is reportedly in shambles](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/defense-secretary-pete-hegseth-pentagon-leaks-signalgate-trump.html), and [Tulsi Gabbard](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/tulsi-gabbard-video-nuclear-war-bomb-shelters-rcna212317) as Cabinet members advising the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) through something like the Cuban Missile Crisis. Worse, imagine such a world on the brink of nuclear war and some of the top thought leaders influencing [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s foreign policy are split between the self-described “[proud Islamophobe](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-laura-loomer-9-11-conspiracy-theories-rcna171134)” [Laura Loomer](https://loomered.com/) and the [ultranationalist MAGA ideologue Steve Bannon](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/steve-bannon-nazi-salute-cpac-rcna193167).

Whether you grew up anywhere between the Cold War or the War on Terror, the idea of a hot war with [Iran](https://irangov.ir/) was always understood to be existentially risky. But it’s at these moments when expert opinion and rational analysis of data and intelligence are required. We don’t appear to have anything approximating that in the [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/).

And as [Joseph Cirincione noted](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/iran-israel-us-nuclear-war-risks-rcna213653) on these pages last week, [U.S. intelligence and military officials have warned for years](https://armscontrolcenter.org/fact-sheet-statements-against-a-military-attack-on-iran/) of the potential consequences of a U.S. attack on [Iran](https://irangov.ir/) — which include [Iran](https://irangov.ir/)’s taking its nuclear program underground, racing to build a nuclear weapon to ward off (or avenge) regime change and attacking [U.S. military](https://www.jcs.mil/) targets in the Middle East. There’s also always the risk that a half-decapitated Islamic Republic, one of the world’s leading state sponsors of terror, retaliates with more lo-fi methods — say, a simple conventional bomb exploding in a major city’s mass transit system or a cyberattack that cripples air travel.

That’s the thing about war: It never goes as planned. Even now that the U.S. has dropped bunker-busting, 30,000-pound GBU-57s on [Iran](https://irangov.ir/)’s Fordo nuclear plant, that’s unlikely to be the last word.

[Intelligence reports indicate](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/19/us/politics/iran-nuclear-weapons-assessment.html) [Iran](https://irangov.ir/) already has enough weapons-grade uranium to produce a nuclear weapon. And if the regime is as hell-bent on suicidal apocalypse as [Israeli](https://www.gov.il/) [Prime Minister](https://www.gov.il/he/departments/prime_ministers_office/govil-landing-page) [Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.netanyahu.org.il/) claims, why wouldn’t it attempt a nuclear terror attack if faced with its own demise? On the other hand, if the regime is just talking tough, values its own survival and prefers to fight its dirty wars via proxies like [Hezbollah](https://www.moqawama.org.lb/), the [Houthis](https://ansarollah.com.ye/) and [Hamas](https://hamasinfo.info/) — then wouldn’t we all feel a bit safer if the president and his advisers weren’t extremist chaos agents, feeding red meat to their online armies, or political commentators with little to no experience in their current fields?

> *That’s the thing about war: It never goes as planned.*

Though America’s slide into authoritarianism quickens by the day, there is nominally a group of people who could at least attempt to hit the brakes on the drive to war — and demand that more qualified voices on the matter be heard. We call these people [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) in [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/).

They could remind the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) that they took an oath to defend the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/) — the same document that endows them with America’s warmaking powers. They could signal to Americans that they work directly for the people, not their party’s leader.

But you’d see something like that — [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) defying [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) — only in a satire.
