## [Trump rejects a court ruling on tariffs that could've saved him from himself](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-tariffs-trade-court-ruling-rcna209731)

*Markets, voters and courts are sending [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) the same message on tariffs.*

May 30, 2025, 6:00 AM EDT

By James Downie, MSNBC Opinion Editor

When news broke that the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) had appealed the [U.S. Court of International Trade‚Äôs ruling](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cit.17080/gov.uscourts.cit.17080.55.0.pdf) that most of [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs tariffs are illegal, I thought of the old familiar story of the man who lived by the river.

Upon hearing a weather report that the river will flood, he resolves to stay. ‚ÄúGod will save me,‚Äù he says. After being swept into the river, he‚Äôs carried past a branch he doesn‚Äôt reach for. ‚ÄúGod will save me,‚Äù he says. He doesn‚Äôt take the hand of a fisherman in his boat because, again, ‚ÄúGod will save me.‚Äù When the drowned man gets to heaven, he asks why God let him drown, and God replies, ‚ÄúI sent you a weather report, a branch and a boat. What are you doing here?‚Äù

Over the four months that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has blundered ahead with sweeping tariffs, he has been offered chance after chance to change course‚Äî and rejected them all. But unlike the man in the story, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) isn‚Äôt by himself in the river. We all are.

> *Voters were the next to warn [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) he was headed the wrong direction.*

The earliest warning to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) came from the markets. [They tumbled](https://apnews.com/article/consumer-prices-inflation-trump-trade-6ea513a44876c2f4dc948a25c15b0eb0) as he imposed and pulled back on tariffs on [Canada](https://www.canada.ca/), [China](https://www.gov.cn/) and [Mexico](https://www.gob.mx/) ‚Äî and then things got worse. When [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) revealed his ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù tariffs in April, he promised, ‚ÄúThe markets are going to boom.‚Äù In fact, they plunged in their worst day [since the beginning of the Covid pandemic](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-05-29/explaining-the-newest-wall-street-craze-the-taco-trade). After a week of promising the tariffs would be imposed as scheduled, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) announced a 90-day delay for all countries other than [China](https://www.gov.cn/).

At this point, the pattern is so predictable ‚Äî stocks drop when [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) threatens tariffs and rise when he delays those threats ‚Äî that traders have a new strategy: ‚ÄúTACO‚Äù or ‚Äú[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) Always Chickens Out.‚Äù Informed of the TACO acronym by [CNBC‚Äôs Megan Casella](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Dw8AHT5uF8) at a media availability Wednesday, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) lashed out at the ‚Äúnasty question‚Äù and told Casella, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ever say what you said.‚Äù

Voters were the next to warn [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) he was headed the wrong direction. [The president‚Äôs polling decline accelerated](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/polls/donald-trump-approval-rating-polls.html) after the ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù announcement and stabilized only after he paused those tariffs.

[Court of International Trade‚Äôs decision](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cit.17080/gov.uscourts.cit.17080.55.0.pdf) ‚Äî and a similar ruling from a federal district court judge Thursday ‚Äî provided [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) with the perfect excuse to make the tariff ‚Äúpause‚Äù permanent. The [trade court](http://www.cit.uscourts.gov/)‚Äôs three-judge panel (one [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) and two [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) appointees) ruled unanimously, and the reasoning was straightforward: A decades-old emergency powers law didn‚Äôt ‚Äúdelegate an unbounded tariff authority‚Äù to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), and both the reciprocal tariffs of ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù and the levies on [Canada](https://www.canada.ca/) and [Mexico](https://www.gob.mx/) exceeded the president‚Äôs authorities under that law.

A sane administration, facing voters, markets and courts throwing up their hands and shouting ‚Äústop!‚Äù would heed those calls. But even as [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) delays and delays most of the blanket tariffs, he hasn‚Äôt abandoned them (and his 25% tariffs on [steel, cars and aluminum remain in place](https://bsky.app/profile/josephpolitano.bsky.social/post/3lqbm25ss2k27)). There is no reason to think court rulings will change his mind.

Investors quickly realized that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is still [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), and chaos still reigns.

The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)‚Äôs advisers reacted to the trade court‚Äôs decision with both rage ([‚Äúa judicial coup,‚Äù said Stephen Miller](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/white-house-tariffs-judges_n_6837bff0e4b0e2e0f9a17075)) and dismissal (‚Äúa hiccup,‚Äù said [National Economic Council Chair Kevin Hassett](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/29/trump-tariffs-court-ruling-reaction-00374006)). The [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit](https://cafc.uscourts.gov/) has already [temporarily paused the ruling](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-administration-elon-tariffs-medicaid-immigration-live-updates-rcna209644/rcrd80409?canonicalCard=true). And even if the trade court‚Äôs decision survives, there are multiple other statutes [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) could use to reimpose tariffs, albeit in a more deliberative and limited fashion.

No wonder, then, that, though [stock futures jumped ahead of markets‚Äô opening Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/29/court-strikes-down-trump-reciprocal-tariffs.html), those gains disappeared almost entirely. Investors quickly realized that Trump is still Trump and chaos still reigns.

Other than the investors winning [TACO](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) trades, the country is hurting from the chaos. The [U.S. economy shrank in the first quarter](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/31/first-quarter-gdp-growth-will-be-just-0point3percent-as-tariffs-stoke-stagflation-conditions-says-cnbc-survey.html), even without the worst effects of sweeping tariffs. Consumer spending grew 1.2%, [less than half the average from 2022 to 2024](https://econjared.substack.com/p/data_note-q1-gdp-at-02-vs-initial?publication_id=3782367&post_id=164722537&isFreemail=true&r=2203u&triedRedirect=true&). A [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/) analysis of disclosures from [America, Europe and Japan‚Äôs largest companies](https://www.reuters.com/business/trumps-tariff-tally-34-billion-counting-global-companies-say-2025-05-29/) finds ‚Äúan overwhelming majority say the erratic nature of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs trade policies has made it impossible to accurately estimate costs‚Äù and that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs on-again, off-again trade war has already hit those companies with \$34 billion in higher costs.

Meanwhile, small businesses, lacking the financial resources and the political influence of the largest companies, face even stronger headwinds. Duties on materials for everything from [water bottles](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/business/trumps-china-tariffs-small-businesses.html) to [cowboy boots](https://www.texasmonthly.com/style/how-tariffs-could-impact-western-wear/) have raised costs ‚Äî and many, if not all, of those costs will be passed on to us.

And those are just the most tangible effects. ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre really not seeing is the businesses that aren‚Äôt being started,‚Äù [economics professor Justin Wolfers told MSNBC‚Äôs Nicolle Wallace on Wednesday](https://youtu.be/__iCLm69puI?feature=shared&t=331). ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a factory that could be built,‚Äù but the cost of imports ‚Äúeither just went up 50% or went up 10%, but no one can be sure.‚Äù

The markets, the voters and two courts have all offered [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) a hand to rescue him from this river of madness. But he has rejected every entreaty. As is so often the case with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), though, it‚Äôll be others who drown.
