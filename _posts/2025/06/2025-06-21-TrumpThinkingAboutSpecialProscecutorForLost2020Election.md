## [As Trump floats special prosecutor on 2020, he should be careful what he wishes for](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-floats-special-prosecutor-2020-careful-wishes-rcna214116)

*The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has already initiated investigations into his failed [2020 candidacy](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). Now he wants a special counsel to tell him what he wants to hear.*

June 20, 2025, 12:12 PM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

With time running out in the [2024 presidential election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/2024presgeresults.pdf) and early voting underway across much of the country, then-[Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [JD Vance](https://bioguide.congress.gov/search/bio/V000137) refused to answer questions about who was the rightful winner of the [2020 race](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf). The [Ohio](https://www.ohio.gov/) [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [complained at the time](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-steps-vances-message-clings-rigged-election-lie-rcna174049) that political journalists were “obsessed” with the election from four years earlier.

That same day, [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Majority Whip](https://www.majoritywhip.gov/) [Tom Emmer (T-MN6)](https://emmer.house.gov/) appeared on [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/) and faced related questions from host [Kaitlan Collins](https://www.cnn.com/profiles/kaitlan-collins#about). “What are you doing talking about something that’s four years ago?” [the Minnesota Republican asked](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-steps-vances-message-clings-rigged-election-lie-rcna174049), rather than answering the question directly. “This is something that you folks in the media want to focus on, on a regular basis.”

As it turns out, someone is “obsessed” with the [2020 race](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf), and someone wants to focus on it “on a regular basis” — but it’s not news organizations.

Common sense might suggest that [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), now that he’s returned to power, might shift his attention to his [presidential](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) responsibilities, rather than relitigate his failed [2020 re-election bid](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), when he lost to [Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) by more than 7 million votes while failing to crack 47% of the popular vote. But on a nearly daily basis — online, during [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) events, in interviews, etc. — the incumbent [Republican] [president](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/) fixates on the [2020 race](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf) to a degree that can charitably be described as unhealthy.

Hardly a day goes by that Trump doesn’t say something about his ridiculous belief that the [2020 race](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf) was “rigged.” Indeed, just this week, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [floated a new, weird conspiracy theory](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-fbis-patel-run-weird-new-2020-election-conspiracy-theory-rcna213962) — his latest idea apparently has something to do with [Chinese license plates](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-fbis-patel-run-weird-new-2020-election-conspiracy-theory-rcna213962) — adding fresh evidence to the idea that he just can’t move on from his defeat, even after having completed a successful comeback.

On Friday morning, the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) appeared to take this pitiful crusade in a new direction. [The Washington Post reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/20/trump-presidency-news/#link-SVOSEU4GGBC5XL637VC5EPP2GQ):

> *[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is calling for a special prosecutor to investigate the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf), which he has baselessly claimed for years was rigged against him, despite there being no evidence of widespread voter fraud. Nevertheless, six months into his second term as [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is still relitigating the race he lost to [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) [Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/,) — and is now calling for a special counsel to investigate his claims of fraud that have already been rejected by the courts dozens of times.*

As part of [his latest online tantrum](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114715950565535905), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) peddled a variety of familiar and child-like assertions before claiming there’s “MASSIVE and OVERWHELMING” evidence of election “fraud” that he’s never been able to produce.

The [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) added, “A Special Prosecutor must be appointed. ... Let the work begin!”

Look, there’s little value in me writing a few hundred words to explain that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) lost fair square and the “overwhelming” evidence doesn’t exist. Let’s just stipulate that all fair-minded observers already know this.

Instead, I’m going to note that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) should be careful what he wishes for.

A couple of years ago, the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) [reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/02/11/trump-campaign-report-electoral-fraud/) on [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s political operation having hired the [Berkeley Research Group](https://www.thinkbrg.com/) to scrutinize the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf). The purpose of the contract was obvious: The then-outgoing president and his team wanted the researchers to bolster [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s conspiracy theories about voter fraud and election irregularities.

That didn’t work out well: [BRG](https://www.thinkbrg.com/) [couldn’t find any meaningful evidence](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-researchers-reportedly-couldnt-find-evidence-fraud-rcna70554). As my [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) colleague Hayes Brown [joked](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/report-makes-trumps-2020-fundraising-scam-even-clearer-rcna70404), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) “must have really hated that his campaign spent over \$600,000 to be told he was wrong.”

We later learned that the [BRG](https://www.thinkbrg.com/) wasn’t alone in tackling such an endeavor. Months later, the [Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) published [a related report](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/04/27/trump-false-election-fraud-claims/) on [Team Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) paying \$750,000 to [Simpatico Software Systems](https://simpatico.com/), which was also tasked with finding evidence of [2020](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf) voter fraud. That didn’t go well, either: The company was unable to tell [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) what they wanted to hear because the evidence simply didn’t exist.

Ken Block, the owner of [Simpatico Software Systems](https://simpatico.com/), later wrote [an op-ed](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2024/01/02/trump-lies-voter-fraud-2020-impact-2024-election/72057016007/) in [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/), which was published with a striking headline: “[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) paid me to find voter fraud. Then he lied after I found [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf) wasn’t stolen.”

In his opinion piece, Block, a former [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) gubernatorial candidate, explained that his investigation failed to turn up meaningful evidence of voter fraud, adding that rank-and-file [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) voters have been fed “a steady diet of innuendo, misrepresentations and outright lies” on the issue.

I mention this because [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has already initiated investigations into his [2020 defeat](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf). These investigators were motivated to tell their client exactly what he wanted to hear, but they simply couldn’t provide [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) with proof that didn’t exist. The same is true of state-based audits, which confirmed that the actual election results from that race were accurate.

Now, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is effectively saying that yet another investigation is necessary, since the original investigations, including the ones he paid for, were apparently too reality-based for him. What’s more, the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) is in the hands of shameless [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) loyalists who might very well find some far-right partisan willing to take on the duties of a special counsel.

But happens when this investigation concludes the same thing as all of the other investigations? Does he seek another? Followed by another?
