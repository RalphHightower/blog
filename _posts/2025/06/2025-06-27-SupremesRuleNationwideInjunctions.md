title: "Supreme Court Rules Against Lower Courts Issuing Nationwide Injunctions Halting Illegal Presidential Executive Orders"
---


Unbelievable! [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is constitutionality, ethnically, and morally bankrupt president that is illegally issuing executive orders to usurp [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/).

## [Supreme Court sides with Trump on birthright citizenship nationwide injunctions](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-birthright-citizenship-ruling-injunctions-trump-rcna207129)

*The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) asked the [justices](https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/justices.aspx) to narrow nationwide injunctions against the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s executive order.*

June 27, 2025, 10:17 AM EDT / Updated June 27, 2025, 10:25 AM EDT
By [Jordan Rubin](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jordan-rubin-ncpn1301611)

The [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) sided with the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) in curbing nationwide injunctions granted against his birthright citizenship order, [in a 6-3 ruling](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/read-supreme-court-birthright-citizenship-ruling-trump-full-text-pdf-rcna209703) with the [court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/)’s [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)-appointees in the majority and the [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) appointees dissenting.

“These injunctions — known as ‘universal injunctions’ — likely exceed the equitable authority that [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) has granted to [federal courts](https://www.uscourts.gov/),” [Justice Amy Coney Barrett](https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/justices.aspx) wrote in a decision that didn’t decide the underlying legality of [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s attempt to restrict birthright citizenship. Litigation will continue on the issue in the lower courts and individual plaintiffs can still bring additional challenges against the order.

[Barrett](https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/justices.aspx) wrote that such broad injunctions were a relatively recent development in the law that’s “conspicuously nonexistent for most of our Nation’s history.”

In her dissent for the court’s three [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) appointees, [Justice Sonia Sotomayor](https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/justices.aspx) called out the [court](https//www.whitehouse.gov/)’s rewarding of the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s “gamesmanship.”

She noted that the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) didn’t ask the [justices](https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/justices.aspx) to fully block the lower court rulings against [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s policy. “Why? The answer is obvious: To get such relief, the Government would have to show that the Order is likely constitutional, an impossible task in light of the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/)’s text, history, this [Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/)’s precedents, federal law, and [Executive Branch](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) practice,” Sotomayor wrote.

“So the Government instead tries its hand at a different game. It asks this [Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) to hold that, no matter how illegal a law or policy, courts can never simply tell the [Executive](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) to stop enforcing it against anyone. Instead, the Government says, it should be able to apply the Citizenship Order (whose legality it does not defend) to everyone except the plaintiffs who filed this lawsuit,” she continued, adding that the “gamesmanship in this request is apparent and the Government makes no attempt to hide it. Yet, shamefully, this [Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) plays along.”

In her own separate dissent, [Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson](https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/justices.aspx) said the [court](https://www.justice.gov/)’s “decision to permit the [Executive](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) to violate the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/) with respect to anyone who has not yet sued is an existential threat to the rule of law.”

The [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) [appealed to the justices](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-birthright-citizenship-supreme-court-rcna196316) after several lower court judges blocked [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-meaning-and-value-of-american-citizenship/) attempting to restrict birthright citizenship. Those judges did not consider the legality of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s order to be a close question; “blatantly unconstitutional” was what one of them [called it](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/judge-trumps-birthright-citizenship-order-blatantly-unconstitutional-rcna189007).  

But the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) didn’t ask the [justices](https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/justices.aspx) to affirm the legality of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s order. Rather, it asked them to curb the nationwide relief granted by those lower court judges, insisting that the judges should’ve stuck to granting relief to the parties who brought the lawsuits in [Washington](https://wa.gov/) state, [Maryland](https://www.maryland.gov/) and [Massachusetts](https://www.mass.gov/). In that respect, [this appeal](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/birthright-citizenship-supreme-court-hearing-trump-rcna206827) wasn’t about the legality of birthright citizenship but about the general propriety of nationwide injunctions, an issue that has long bothered justices in all manner of cases having nothing to do with birthright citizenship.

Yet several [justices](https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/justices.aspx) raised the merits of the birthright citizenship issue during the [rare May 15 hearing](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-birthright-citizenship-injunctions-hearing-rcna199780), quizzing [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [solicitor general](https://www.justice.gov/osg), [John Sauer](https://www.justice.gov/osg/staff-profile/solicitor-general-john-sauer), about when and how the court can get to the heart of the matter. [Justice Elena Kagan](https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/justices.aspx) [pressed](https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2024/24a884_2c83.pdf) [Sauer](https://www.justice.gov/osg/staff-profile/solicitor-general-john-sauer) about his plea for the [justices](https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/justices.aspx) to let litigation over [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s order “percolate” in the lower courts; she told him it could take years to reach the [justices](https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/justices.aspx) under his approach, all while “an untold number of people who, according to all the law that this [Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) has ever made, ought to be citizens who are not being treated as such.”

The [14th Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-14/)’s citizenship clause says: “All persons born or naturalized in the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/), and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) and of the state wherein they reside.”

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s order cites the “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” language in an attempt to deny automatic citizenship to babies born in these two circumstances:

> *(1) when that person’s mother was unlawfully present in the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) and the father was not a [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth, or (2) when that person’s mother’s presence in the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) at the time of said person’s birth was lawful but temporary . . . and the father was not a [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth.*

But “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” has long been understood to apply in narrow circumstances not at issue in this case. As a brief to the [justices](https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/justices.aspx) from [constitutional](https://constitution.congress.gov/) and immigration law scholars [explained](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A884/356177/20250422104853697_CASA%20Amicus%20Brief%20FINAL%20FOR%20FILING.pdf), the jurisdictional requirement “exempted a narrow category of persons who, despite being born on U.S. soil, were not required to fully obey U.S. law. These included the children of foreign diplomats and hostile occupying forces, as well as the members of Indian tribes, who were viewed as members of distinct political communities.”

The scholars cited the 1898 [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) case of [Wong Kim Ark](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1850-1900/169us649) for the proposition that “[a]ll other noncitizens were subject to the jurisdiction of the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) while they were in the country.” That’s one of the cases [Sotomayor](https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/justices.aspx) mentioned at the May hearing, when she told [Sauer](https://www.justice.gov/osg/staff-profile/solicitor-general-john-sauer) that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s order violates “not just one but, by my count, four established [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) precedents.”
