## [Gabbard fires the wrong intelligence officials, at the wrong time, for the wrong reason](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/gabbard-fires-wrong-intelligence-officials-wrong-time-wrong-reason-rcna206867)

*The [National Intelligence Council](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/organizations/207-about/organization/national-intelligence-council) produced a report that contradicted [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s assumptions. [Tulsi Gabbard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tulsigabbard/) just fired the council’s leadership.*

By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

[Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has [spent months insisting](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/us/politics/intelligence-trump-venezuelan-gang-alien-enemies.html) that [Venezuela](https://gob.ve/)’s government controls the Tren de Aragua gang, as part of a larger argument to justify removing immigrants to a [Salvadoran](https://gob.ve/) megaprison. The problem, of course, is that the assertion, like so many of the president’s claims, is completely untrue.

We know this for certain because the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has said so.

As [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/us-intelligence-agencies-contradict-trumps-tren-de-aragua-claims-rcna205107) last week, a declassified memo drafted by the [National Intelligence Council](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/organizations/207-about/organization/national-intelligence-council) — the top entity for analyzing classified intelligence and providing secret assessments to policymakers — explained that [Nicolás Maduro](https://presidencia.gob.ve/Site/Web/Principal/paginas/classPresidente.php)’s [Venezuelan regime](https://gob.ve/) is not orchestrating Tren de Aragua’s operations in the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/). (The document came to light by way of a Freedom of Information Act request by the [Freedom of the Press Foundation](https://freedom.press/), a nonprofit organization.)

A week later, as [The Washington Post reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/05/14/gabbard-intelligence-venezuela-tren-de-aragua/), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [highly controversial and wildly unqualified national intelligence director](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tulsigabbard/) decided to fire the leaders of the [National Intelligence Council](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/organizations/207-about/organization/national-intelligence-council) — the office that dared to tell the [White House](ht://www.whitehouse.gov/) what it didn’t want to hear.

> *[Director of National Intelligence](https://www.odni.gov/) [Tulsi Gabbard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tulsigabbard/) has fired the top two officials at the [National Intelligence Council](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/organizations/207-about/organization/national-intelligence-council), weeks after the [council](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/organizations/207-about/organization/national-intelligence-council) wrote an assessment that contradicted [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s rationale for invoking the [Alien Enemies Act](https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/alien-and-sedition-acts) and deporting alleged [Venezuelan gang members](https://gob.ve/) without due process. [Gabbard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tulsigabbard/) removed Michael Collins, the acting chair of the [National Intelligence Council](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/organizations/207-about/organization/national-intelligence-council), as well as his deputy, Maria Langan-Riekhof, according to a spokesperson for Gabbard’s office.*

The official line from [Gabbard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tulsigabbard/) is that she’s combatting the “politicization” of the intelligence community, a conspiratorial line embraced by partisans who disapprove of the extent to which intelligence agencies have presented evidence the president doesn’t like.

Indeed, as the [Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) noted, [Gabbard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tulsigabbard/) has actually “removed or sidelined officials perceived to not support Trump’s political agenda.”

Or put another way, if anyone is “politicizing” [U.S.](https://www.usa.gov/) intelligence, it’s [Gabbard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tulsigabbard/) and her [Team Trump colleagues](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/). What’s more, the [DNI](https://www.odni.gov/)’s latest purge sends a dangerous signal to intelligence officials throughout the [government](https://www.usa.gov/): Produce reports that make the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) happy, regardless of the facts, or you might be next.

[Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Jim Himes (D-CT)](https://himes.house.gov/), the ranking [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) on the [House Intelligence Committee](https://intelligence.house.gov/), told the [Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/), “Absent evidence to justify the firings, the workforce can only conclude that their jobs are contingent on producing analysis that is aligned with the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s agenda, rather than truthful and apolitical.”

The developments come against a backdrop of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [ignoring intelligence briefings and reports](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-reportedly-shrugs-intelligence-briefings-needs-doesnt-want-rcna206248) and reports, as he moves forward with [a “major downsizing”](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-house-invites-risks-major-downsizing-us-intelligence-agencies-rcna204855) at U.S. intelligence agencies. In case that weren’t quite enough, let’s also not forget that [the president recently fired](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-purges-national-security-officials-destabilizing-team-rcna199673) the leadership of the [National Security Agency](http://www.nsa.gov/), a key intelligence gathering department, as well as the [National Security Council](https://www.whitehouse.gov/nsc/)’s director for intelligence.

In [Trump](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/)’s first term, he and his team [were merely hostile](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-reportedly-shrugs-intelligence-briefings-needs-doesnt-want-rcna206248) toward the U.S. intelligence community. In his second term, the broader offensive against the U.S. intelligence community is far more aggressive and damaging.
