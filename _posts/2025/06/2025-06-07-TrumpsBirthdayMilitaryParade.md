## [The predicted consequences of Trump’s massive military parade keep getting worse](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-military-parade-cost-washington-dc-streets-bowser-rcna210671)

*The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s expensive — and literally destructive — parade is poised to significantly damage the streets of [Washington](https://dc.gov/) next weekend.*

June 3, 2025, 3:50 PM EDT
By [Ja'han Jones](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jahan-jones-ncpn371241)

[Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s plans for a [massive, expensive military parade](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-military-parade-cost-birthday-rcna205872) in [Washington, D.C.](https://dc.gov/), already seemed absurd when juxtaposed against his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s [mass firings at federal agencies](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/elon-musk-leaving-doge-trump-white-house-rcna209974) and his plans to institute deep cuts to federal programs many Americans rely on.

But the true cost of the parade seems to keep getting worse.

The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) recently told [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/ )’ [Kristen Welker](https://www.nbcnews.com/author/kristen-welker-ncpn6396) that the parade’s price tag — which could reach \$45 million — would be [“peanuts compared to the value of doing it.”](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-defends-high-cost-military-parade-peanuts-rcna204581) But the actual value of hosting a parade — which, in a fashion reminiscent of dictatorships, will feature dozens of military vehicles and thousands of service members — is debatable at best.

And [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/army-estimates-trump-military-parade-cost-16-million-damage-streets-dc-rcna210131) recently on some of the destruction that the June 14 parade — a seemingly frivolous pet project to celebrate 250 years of the [U.S. Army](https://www.army.mil/) that just so happens to fall on [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s birthday — stands to inflict on [Washington](https://dc.gov/)’s streets:

> *The cost to repair [Washington, D.C.](https://dc.gov,/), streets after the upcoming military parade celebrating the [Army](https://www.army.mil/)’s [250th anniversary](https://www.army.mil/1775/) could cost as much as \$16 million, according to U.S. military officials.*

> *That’s part of an estimated \$45 million total cost for the June 14 military parade, which coincides with [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s 79th birthday. The cost estimates have fluctuated as planning continues.*

And that’s taxpayer money being spent as [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) withholds tens of millions of dollars allocated for things like [climate change studies](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/02/1117653/the-trump-administration-has-shut-down-more-than-100-climate-studies/) and other [research grants](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01645-4), or any number of federal programs that stand to benefit a large number of Americans — certainly more so than a military parade.

[D.C.](https://dc.gov/) [Mayor](https://mayor.dc.gov/node) [Muriel Bowser](https://mayor.dc.gov/biography/muriel-bowser) has been sounding the alarm for months on the parade’s potential destruction, saying in April that military tanks [“would not be good,”](https://apnews.com/article/military-parade-dc-trump-9ca70b018fe4f663ecaaf993d1b45a59) adding: “If military tanks were used, they should be accompanied with many millions of dollars to repair the roads.”

[Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) have been eager to use their federal power over [Washington](https://dc.gov/) — due to it not being an official state — no matter what the mayor says. In March, [Bowser](https://mayor.dc.gov/biography/muriel-bowser) said her decision to paint over a D.C. plaza honoring the Black Lives Matter movement [came amid pressure from the White House](https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/dcs-mayor-defends-her-decision-to-have-black-lives-matter-plaza-painted-over/3859704/), suggesting she had acquiesced because there are “bigger fish to fry.” And now [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) — who have [refused to address](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/us/washington-dc-budget-house-johnson.html) a \$1 billion funding shortfall they created for the district — are trying to pass a law that would [roll back voting rights in D.C.](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/house-oversight-committee-noncitizens-washington-dc-elections-rcna209277) as well.

All of this appears to be aligned with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s declaration that the federal government [should “take over” Washington](https://apnews.com/article/trump-washington-crime-homeless-home-rule-congress-5e34be44cb3bebae76dcb81743b3e31d), using language befitting the leader of an occupying military. And his massive, expensive and literally destructive military parade — all at taxpayers’ expense — seems like it would be a crowning achievement in that mission.
