[Rep. Madeleine Dean](https://dean.house.gov/) of Pennsylvania pressed [Commerce](https://www.commerce.gov/) Secretary Howard Lutnick at a House hearing about trade deficits and the uncertainty [Presiden](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s tariff plan has caused since its rollout in April. [Dean](https://dean.house.gov/) brought up [Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/) increasing the price of bananas amid the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)'s tariffs.

## [Commerce‚Äôs Lutnick receives a timely reminder: ‚ÄòWe cannot build bananas in America‚Äô](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/commerces-lutnick-receives-timely-reminder-cannot-build-bananas-americ-rcna211501)

*While trying to defend tariffs, the [commerce secretary](https://www.commerce.gov/about/leadership/howard-lutnick) was asked about the rising price of bananas. His response didn‚Äôt do him any favors.*

June 6, 2025, 2:47 PM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

Ahead of [Donald Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-says-no-evidence-justify-unprecedented-biden-investigation-rcna211439)‚Äôs second inaugural, there were plenty of rumors that billionaire [Howard Lutnick](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/howard-lutnicks-vision-great-jobs-future-looks-lot-rcna203873) was well positioned to lead the [Treasury Department](home.treasury.gov/) ‚Äî one of the most sought-after positions in any [White House Cabinet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/). [The Associated Press reported](https://apnews.com/article/howard-lutnick-trump-crypto-economy-elon-musk-a03d95e323f7d2d4b722184d83e7b388) that some prominent supporters had lobbied on his behalf.

Those efforts ultimately fell short, and [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) tapped [Lutnick](https://www.commerce.gov/about/leadership/howard-lutnick) to serve as [commerce secretary](https://www.commerce.gov/about/leadership/howard-lutnick). As for why, exactly, he didn‚Äôt get a more prominent position, [The Bulwark reported](https://www.thebulwark.com/p/trumps-transition-chair-howard-lutnick-treasury-secretary-wannabe-shooting-himself-in-foot) two weeks after Election Day that [Lutnick](https://www.commerce.gov/about/leadership/howard-lutnick) kept ‚Äúshooting himself in the foot‚Äù with foolish rhetoric. The report quoted a [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) adviser who said [Lutnick](https://www.commerce.gov/about/leadership/howard-lutnick) needed to learn how to ‚Äúshut the fuck up.‚Äù

And yet, he keeps finding microphones and making things worse for himself.

This week, for example, [Lutnick](https://www.commerce.gov/about/leadership/howard-lutnick) appeared on [Capitol Hill](https://www.congress.gov/), where he seemed eager to defend the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)‚Äôs policies on trade tariffs.

As part of one especially memorable exchange, [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Madeleine Dean (D-PA4)](https://dean.house.gov/) asked the [Cabinet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) secretary, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the tariff on bananas?‚Äù He responded, ‚ÄúThe tariff on bananas would be representative of the countries that produce them,‚Äù before ultimately acknowledging that the rate would be 10%.

The congresswoman reminded the witness that [Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/) has already increased the cost of bananas by 8%. After pointing to the possibility of increasingly unlikely trade deals, [Lutnick](https://www.commerce.gov/about/leadership/howard-lutnick) eventually declared: ‚ÄúIf you build in [America](https://www.usa.gov/), and you produce your product in [America](https://www.usa.gov/), there will be no tariff.‚Äù

It was at that point that [Dean](https://dean.house.gov/) lowered the boom. ‚ÄúWe cannot build bananas in [America](https://www.usa.gov/),‚Äù she explained.

[Lutnick](https://www.commerce.gov/about/leadership/howard-lutnick) didn‚Äôt respond, which was just as well given the circumstances.

Complicating matters for the [commerce secretary](https://www.commerce.gov/about/leadership/howard-lutnick), embarrassing moments like these have become a staple of his tenure. [Lutnick](https://www.commerce.gov/about/leadership/howard-lutnick) announced that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) was [preparing to waive taxes](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/lutnick-says-trump-wants-waive-taxes-those-earning-under-150000-when-budget-2025-03-13/) on Americans earning under \$150,000 per year, only to [walk that back](https://x.com/Acyn/status/1900273696314638415) soon after. He urged a national television audience [to buy stock in Tesla](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/commerce-secretary-tesla-stock-lutnick-rcna197244), sparking an ethics controversy the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [struggled to defend](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/democrat-eyes-investigation-commerce-secretary-promotes-tesla-stock-rcna197454).

In one especially glaring incident, [Lutnick](https://www.commerce.gov/about/leadership/howard-lutnick) suggested that [only criminals would complain](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/social-security-trump-cabinet-secretary-inadvertently-gives-away-game-rcna197743) about missing a [Social Security](https://www.ssa.gov/) check. A month later, the secretary pitched a ‚Äúnew model‚Äù of American employment that [sounded an awful lot](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/howard-lutnicks-vision-great-jobs-future-looks-lot-rcna203873) like the factory jobs that existed in the 19th century.

And don‚Äôt even get me started on his ‚Äú[‚Äúlittle screws to make iPhones‚Äù](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/howard-lutnick-trump-commerce-secretary-wildest-statements.html)‚Äù comments.

The [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/) [recently reported](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/howard-lutnick-trump-trade-agenda-messaging-75d84e01) that [Lutnick](https://www.commerce.gov/about/leadership/howard-lutnick)‚Äôs rhetorical record was proving to be so ‚Äúchallenging‚Äù to the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) that officials asked him to start saying less. He might need a reminder.
