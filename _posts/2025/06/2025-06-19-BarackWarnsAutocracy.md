## [Barack Obama warns the U.S. is ‘dangerously close’ to slipping into autocracy under Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/barack-obama-trump-speech-trump-autocracy-rcna213729)

*In rare public remarks, the [former president](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) said recent actions from the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) are “not consistent with [American democracy](https://constitution.congress.gov/).”*

Former [Former President Barack Obama](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/watch/obama-imagine-if-i-had-done-any-of-this-236665413569) has issued a warning about the future of [American democracy](https://constitution.congress.gov/), cautioning that the country is “dangerously close” to normalizing behavior “consistent with autocracies.”

Speaking Tuesday night in [Hartford](https://www.hartfordct.gov/Government), [Connecticut](https://portal.ct.gov/), he offered thinly veiled criticism of [President Donald Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/donald-trump) and questioned the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s commitment to [democracy](https://constitution.congress.gov/).

“If you follow regularly what is said by those who are in charge of the [federal government](https://www.usa.gov/) right now, there is a weak commitment to what we understood — and not just my generation, at least since World War II — our understanding of how a liberal [democracy](https://constitution.congress.gov/) is supposed to work,” [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) said, [according to Connecticut Public Radio](https://www.ctpublic.org/news/2025-06-17/former-president-barack-obama-headlines-forum-at-the-bushnell).

> *But if you want to deliver on change, then it’s a game of addition, not subtraction.<br />Former [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Barack Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/)*

“What we’re seeing right now … is not consistent with [American democracy](https://constitution.congress.gov/),” he continued. “It is consistent with autocracies. It is consistent with [Hungary](https://kormany.hu/) under [Orbán](https://kormany.hu/miniszterelnok/eletrajz). It’s consistent with places that hold elections but do not otherwise observe what we think of as a fair system in which everybody’s voice matters and people have a seat at the table and nobody’s above the law. We’re not there yet completely, but I think that we are dangerously close to normalizing behavior like that.”

Speaking just days after millions of Americans demonstrated against [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) in the nationwide [“No Kings” protests](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/no-kings-protest-trump-meaning-elon-musk-rcna213269), [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) praised the pushback from individuals outside of government, but stressed that elected officials need to do more to protect American institutions.

“There also have to be people in government in both parties who say, ‘No, you can’t do that,’” the [former president](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) said.

The event marked a relatively rare public appearance for [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/), who has largely avoided the spotlight since leaving office. Last week, [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/)’s [Mark Leibovich](https://www.theatlantic.com/author/mark-leibovich/) [criticized his low profile](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/06/obama-retirement-trump-era/683068/), writing that “the most effective communicator in the [Democratic Party]() continues to opt for minimal communication.”

Despite his concerns, the [former president]() told the crowd he is still hopeful [American democracy](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/americans-defend-democracy-trump-rcna210425) will prevail. He also offered advice to young people about how they can “deliver on change.” Per [Connecticut Public Radio](https://www.ctpublic.org/):

> *I’m still optimistic — I’m still the ‘hope’ guy. I guess the thing when I’m talking to young people that they need to hear the most is, it is important to be impatient with injustice and cruelty, and there’s a healthy outrage we should be exhibiting in terms of what’s currently happening both here and around the world. But if you want to deliver on change, then it’s a game of addition, not subtraction. You have to find ways to make common ground with people who don’t agree with you on everything but agree with you on some things.*

[Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) said the only way to protect the future of [democracy](https://constitution.congress.gov/) — and the [United States]() — is for the American people to work together:

> *When people actually meet and get to know each other ... what Lincoln called those ‘better angels’ come out. People start recognizing themselves in each other and they start trusting each other, and that’s not just the basis for [democracy](https://constitution.congress.gov/), but that’s the basis for our long-term salvation.*
