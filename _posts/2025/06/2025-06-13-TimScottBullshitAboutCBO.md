*It’s a problem that the senator accused the [budget office](https;//www.cbo.gov/) of being wrong about things that happened before its existence, but that’s not all.*

June 13, 2025, 2:59 PM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

In recent weeks, [congressional](https;//www.congress.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) and the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) have [repeatedly gone after](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-target-cbo-congressional-budget-office-rcna210938) the [Congressional Budget Office](https://www.cbo.gov/), not because the nonpartisan analysts did something wrong, but because the [CBO](https://www.cbo.gov/) has provided the public with facts that [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his allies don’t like.

Indeed, the offensive couldn’t be any more straightforward: The budget office produced objective data that makes the [Republican Party](https://www.gop.com/)’s domestic policy megabill — the inaptly named [“One Big Beautiful Bill Act”](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text) — [look like a far-right disaster](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republican-megabill-make-rich-richer-poor-poorer-cbo-concludes-rcna212647), so the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) officials have scrambled [to discredit](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-target-cbo-congressional-budget-office-rcna210938) the source of independent information.

Some of these efforts have been more embarrassing than others. [The Washington Post reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/12/trump-presidency-news/#link-VCBZIHDD6ZFJHKIIGPGWHD4CPA):

> *Like many [congressional](https://www.congress.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) and members of the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) already have, [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Tim Scott (T-SC)](https://www.scott.senate.gov/) on Thursday attacked the nonpartisan [Congressional Budget Office](https://www.cbo.gov/) for its scoring of the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/)’s [massive tax and immigration bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text), arguing that the [CBO](https://www.cbo.gov/)’s estimates are inaccurate. In a video shared on X, [Scott](https://www.scott.senate.gov/) accused the [office](https://www.cbo.gov/) ... of being wrong in its scoring of tax cuts implemented in the 1930s and the 1960s.*

There was, however, a rather glaring problem with the [senator](https://www.scott.senate.gov/)’s pitch: The [Congressional Budget Office](https://www.cbo.gov/) wasn’t created until 1974. [When Scott said](https://x.com/SenatorTimScott/status/1933147366493753769) said, “Wrong then. Wrong Now,” he was, unfortunately, wrong.

And it’d be an unfortunate example of a [senator](https://www.senate.gov/) taking aim at the [budget office](https;//www.cbo.gov/), but stumbling over inconvenient facts, if we were to stop there. But as it turns out, that wasn’t the only problem with his pitch.

[Scott](https://www.scott.senate.gov/) claimed, for example, “In 2017, the [CBO](https://www.cbo.gov/) said the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would increase the deficit and the debt by trillions of dollars. What happened? They were wrong.” Actually, no, the [CBO](https://www.cbo.gov/) was right: The [Republicans](https://www.gop.com=)’ 2017 package of tax breaks for the wealthy and big corporations [really did increase the deficit and the debt by trillions of dollars](https://www.propublica.org/article/national-debt-trump) and the debt by trillions of dollars. That’s not a matter of opinion; it’s simply what happened.

Moments later, in the same video, the senator said [CBO](https://www.cbo.gov/) analysts “were wrong on the Mellon tax cuts in the 1930s.” The obvious problem with this is the fact that the [CBO](https://www.cbo.gov/) didn’t exist in the 1930s. However, the less obvious problem is that the Mellon tax cuts were approved in the 1920s, not the 1930s, shortly before the Great Depression.

But wait, there’s more. Also in the minute-long video, [Scott](https://www.scott.senate.gov/) said the [CBO](https://www.cbo.gov/) was also “wrong on the [Reagan](https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/) tax cuts in the 1980s,” which is sort of true, but not in the way the [South Carolinian](https://www.sc.gov/) meant. As the [Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget](https://www.crfb.org/)’s [Marc Goldwein](https://www.crfb.org/biography/staff/marc-goldwein) noted, the [CBO](https://www.cbo.gov/) “actually overestimated revenue collection in the 1980s,” which was the opposite of the point the senator was trying to make.

In his next breath, [Scott](https://www.scott.senate.gov/) said of the [CBO](https://www.cbo.gov/), “When have they been right? I don’t know either.” Actually, I do know: The office’s track record on forecasting future budget deficits [has been pretty impressive](https://bsky.app/profile/pbump.com/post/3lqdkr7dwcc2e) in recent years, whether or not the senator is aware of this.

For good measure, let’s not skip past the fact that [Scott](https://www.scott.senate.gov/) went on to say, “The Laffer Curve is right. ... It has always worked; I think it always will work.”

The Laffer Curve is a creation of Art Laffer, arguably the nation’s preeminent cheerleader for a ridiculous idea: Tax cuts are self-financing. He’s spent decades telling policymakers they can slash tax rates, especially for the wealthy, and the tax breaks necessarily pay for themselves through stronger economic growth and increased revenue.

[Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) have repeatedly tried to govern with this idea in mind, [and they’ve always failed](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-pretends-failed-economic-theory-has-been-proven-true-msna1244651). Critics of the Laffer Curve have [consistently been proven wrong](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-pretends-failed-economic-theory-has-been-proven-true-msna1244651), and proponents of the discredited idea have consistently been proven wrong.

[Scott](https://www.scott.senate.gov/) really ought to know all of this. He is, after all, the chairman of the [Senate Banking Committee](http://www.banking.senate.gov/public) and a member of the [Senate Finance Committee](http://www.finance.senate.gov/). But despite these many glaring, factual errors, the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [senator](https://www.scott.senate.gov/) not only put this video online, he left it online even after its errors were exposed.

It reflects an indifference toward reality that has become a staple of the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/)’s offensive against the [Congressional Budget Office](https://www.cbo.gov/).
