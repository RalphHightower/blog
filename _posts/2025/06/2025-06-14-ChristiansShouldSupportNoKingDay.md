## [‘No Kings’ protests against Trump deserve American Christians' support](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-no-kings-protest-christians-rcna212964)

*[Faithful America](https://www.faithfulamerica.org/) will be carrying around a [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) Golden Calf to send the message to other Christians that worshipping [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is idolatrous.*

June 14, 2025, 7:50 AM EDT 'No King'
By [Guthrie Graves-Fitzsimmons](https://interfaithalliance.org/team/guthrie-graves-fitzsimmons), vice president of programs and strategy, [Interfaith Alliance](https://interfaithalliance.org/)

“I don’t feel like a king,” [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [told Republican lawmakers](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/12/us/politics/trump-no-kings-protests.html) at the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) on Thursday in advance of the [“No Kings”](https://www.nokings.org/) rallies happening around the country on Saturday. Lest you think the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) was acknowledging the restraints on his power, it actually sounded more like he was bemoaning those [constitutional guardrails](https://constitution.congress.gov/) and giving voice to kingly ambitions.

> *It sounded like he was bemoaning [constitutional guardrails](https://constitution.congress.gov/) and giving voice to kingly ambitions.*

He has made his kingly ambitions known on social media this year. “LONG LIVE THE KING!” he [posted on Truth Social](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/king-trump-rcna192912) in February. The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) account on [X](https://x.com/) upped the ante by [posting an AI-generated image](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/king-trump-rcna192912) of a coronated [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) on the cover of [Time magazine](https://www.time.com/) with the headline “LONG LIVE THE KING!” In March, he [reposted an AI-generated image of a lion](https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-again-implies-king-sharing-162222560.html) of a lion wearing a crown labeled MAGA with the caption “Kings!”

Though Saturday is expected to be a high tide of authoritarianism — [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is staging [a \$45 million birthday military parade](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-military-parade-cost-washington-dc-streets-bowser-rcna210671) even as he [deploys the National Guard and Marines](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/los-angeles-marines-protest-national-guard-trump-deploy-cost-rcna212130) to squash political dissent in [Los Angeles](https://lacity.gov/) — the more than [2,000 “No Kings” rallies](https://www.nokings.org/) scheduled across the country should reflect an equally high tide of resistance.

I’m attending the flagship march and rally in [Philadelphia](https://philamuseum.org/), the city where the founders of the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) declared independence from the [king of England](https://www.gov.uk/) and where we will declare our refusal to cower to a would-be king in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).

For the [Philadelphia](https://philamuseum.org/) protest, [Faithful America](https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:/faithfulamerica.org__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!sx0Q4UcxHVHCIhPbYyitUoNlcDiHUWrRY3aZVyU2JRWwXNhiroZWjrqI29txlEEI6ZttaDQy40WGhtaHSB82-Q$), an online community of progressive Christians, is bringing [its giant Trump Golden Calf balloon](https://mynbc15.com/news/offbeat/golden-bull-calf-trump-like-idol-evangelical-summit-washington-dc-national-mall-christianity-jewish-faith-exodus-politics-election-capitol-police). It’s a reference to the Exodus passage about the ancient Israelites worshipping an idol they created while Moses was away on Mount Sinai receiving the Ten Commandments.

The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) Golden Calf sends the unmistakable message that Christians worshipping [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is idolatrous, and we rebuke our siblings in Christ who are providing spiritual cover for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s authoritarian destruction of [American democracy](https://constitution.congress.gov/). [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) shows no evidence of personal piety or of an attempt to follow Jesus Christ — recall when he said he [never had to ask God for forgiveness](https://www.cnn.com/2015/07/18/politics/trump-has-never-sought-forgiveness) — and has made it a priority to aid the wealthy and attack the most vulnerable in our society. He exhibits the polar opposite of Christian social ethics.

And yet [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) rode back to the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) with Christian support, and many evangelical and Catholic leaders continue to stand by him even now.

At this pivotal moment, every Christian must ask whether their allegiance is to Christ or to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).

“Religious actors and communities have historically played key roles in both propping up and in dismantling authoritarian systems,” pro-democracy organizers Dr. [Maria J. Stephan](https://protectdemocracy.org/people/maria-j-stephan/) and [Chris Crawford](https://protectdemocracy.org/people/chris-crawford/) write in the “Faithful Fight” [toolkit published by Protect Democracy](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/protectdemocracy.org/work/faithful-leaders-fight-back/__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!sx0Q4UcxHVHCIhPbYyitUoNlcDiHUWrRY3aZVyU2JRWwXNhiroZWjrqI29txlEEI6ZttaDQy40WGhtak9s1WYw$). “Religious symbols, slogans, rituals, organizing infrastructure and communications networks have been important sources of power for autocrats and pro-democracy movements alike.”

As we march today, the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) administration continues to terrorize communities in [Los Angeles](https://lacity.gov/). [Consider this account in The New York Times from a pastor there](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.nytimes.com/2025/06/11/us/la-protests-ice-raids-church-arrest.html__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!sx0Q4UcxHVHCIhPbYyitUoNlcDiHUWrRY3aZVyU2JRWwXNhiroZWjrqI29txlEEI6ZttaDQy40WGhtZbTx-deA$):

The [Rev. Tanya Lopez](https://www.downeymemorial.org/staff), senior pastor of [Downey Memorial Christian Church](https://www.downeymemorial.org/), said she was in her office on Wednesday when three SUVs with tinted windows pulled up to her church. Then, [Ms. Lopez](https://www.downeymemorial.org/staff) said, five men, some wearing badges and tan bulletproof vests that said “POLICE,” rushed out of the vehicles and detained a man in the parking lot. The men, [Ms. Lopez](https://www.downeymemorial.org/staff) said, refused to identify which agency they worked for, and they did not share their names or badge numbers when asked. Their vehicles had out-of-state license plates. They also did not provide a warrant, she said. They took the man into a black SUV. And, [Ms. Lopez](https://www.downeymemorial.org/staff) said that as she shouted instructions in Spanish to the man inside the vehicle, an agent drew a rifle at her.

When an officer pulls a gun on a pastor, it’s clear that Christians need to take sides. And yet [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is sending an unmistakable signal: Christians who step out of line will be targeted. The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has [already attacked](https://religionnews.com/2025/04/04/faith-communities-are-setting-a-courageous-example-for-standing-up-to-trump/) the Catholic bishops, the [Lutheran Church](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/08/catholic-lutheran-vance-flynn-musk-trump/) and [Episcopal Bishop Mariann Budde](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-bishop-budde-sermon-truth-social-rcna188764). [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s congressional allies this week launched an [aggressive investigation](https://homeland.house.gov/2025/06/11/chairmen-green-brecheen-launch-probe-into-200-ngos-over-their-use-of-taxpayer-dollars-during-the-biden-harris-border-crisis/) of a wide range of faith-based groups for their work with migrants.

There are signs of growing Christian resistance to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s authoritarianism. Majorities of all Christian groups oppose [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s military parade, [according to a new poll by the Public Religion Research Institute](https://prri.org/spotlight/military-parade-in-d-c-draws-public-opposition-ahead-of-army-and-trump-celebrations/). This includes Hispanic Catholics (87%), Black Protestants (85%), Hispanic Protestants (78%) white mainline Protestants (72%), white Catholics (65%) and white evangelical Protestants (64%).

In the Gospel of Luke, God sends the angel Gabriel to Mary who tells her that Jesus will be given “the throne of David, his father. He will rule over Jacob’s house forever, and there will be no end to his kingdom.”

Christians believe Christ’s kingdom will reign forever. As American Christians in the year 2025, we must also believe and work to ensure that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s power, granted to him by voters, ends at the end of his second term in accordance with the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/). And every day, until the end of his [presidency](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), he must be prevented from acting like a king and made to remember that we live in a [democracy](https://constitution.congress.gov/).
