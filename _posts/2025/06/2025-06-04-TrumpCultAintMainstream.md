## [Laura Loomer’s White House access erases the line between the fringe and mainstream](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/laura-loomers-white-house-access-erases-line-fringe-mainstream-rcna210863)

*In a normal [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), right-wing activists like Loomer wouldn’t have access. But that’s not [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).*

June 4, 2025, 9:36 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

Amid [speculation](https://www.wired.com/story/trumpworld-tired-of-laura-loomer/) that people close to [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) have grown weary of right-wing activist [Laura Loomer](https://loomered.com/), [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-administration-tariffs-immigration-senate-fema-live-updates-rcna210160/rcrd80640?canonicalCard=true) that she was welcomed back to the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) complex this week for her latest high-level meeting.

> *[Vice President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) [JD Vance](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jd-vance-770a9047/) met [Tuesday] with the far-right activist [Laura Loomer](https://loomered.com/) in a one-on-one meeting inside the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, two sources familiar with the meeting confirmed to [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/). ... The meeting was first reported by [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/).*

Shortly after the report was published, [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) press secretary Karoline Leavitt acknowledged during a briefing that the [vice president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) and [Loomer](https://loomered.com/) did have a private discussion, though she didn’t elaborate on the details of the meeting.

And while it’s certainly of interest to know what the two talked about, that [Loomer](https://loomered.com/) was even offered the opportunity for high-level access is extraordinary.

[Loomer](https://loomered.com/) might not be a household name, but in political circles, she has earned an unfortunate reputation. [Loomer](https://loomered.com/) is [a right-wing activist](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/09/15/laura-loomer-trump-campaign/), a failed [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [congressional](https://www.congress.gov) candidate who has described herself as “[pro-white nationalism](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/07/us/politics/trump-laura-loomer.html)” and a radical conspiracy theorist who has claimed that deadly school shootings were staged and the Sept. 11 attacks were “an inside job.”

She was also [a close confidant to Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-connection-laura-loomer-real-campaign-issue-rcna171258) to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) during the 2024 campaign — whose access and influence appears to have grown.

Last month, for example, [Loomer](https://loomered.com/) [reportedly had a hand](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/dr-casey-means-trumps-new-surgeon-general-nominee-draws-unflattering-s-rcna205556) in derailing [Dr. Janette Nesheiwat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-janette-nesheiwat-3483731a/)’s surgeon general nomination. Around the same time, Mike Waltz was ousted from his national security adviser position [after getting on Loomer’s bad side](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/01/mike-waltz-firing-trump-white-house). Two weeks earlier, [Loomer](https://loomered.com/) was also reportedly [involved in the firing](https://apnews.com/article/justice-department-prosecutor-laura-loomer-white-house-trump-9cd4adc937dd2d915a9a907b1ab312ec) of a U.S. attorney in [California](https://www.ca.gov/).

But perhaps the most important example came to the fore in early April.

It was striking enough to see [the president oust](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-purges-national-security-officials-destabilizing-team-rcna199673) several members of the [National Security Council](https://www.whitehouse.gov/nsc/) and the two top leaders at the [National Security Agency](http://www.nsa.gov/), but the story became even more dramatic when the public learned that the firings came on the heels of a meeting with [Loomer](https://loomered.com/), who promptly took credit for the developments. The [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) published [a striking behind-the-scenes look](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/us/politics/trump-nsc-firings-laura-loomer.html) look at what transpired at the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).

> *Sitting directly across from the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) in the [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), [Ms. Loomer](https://loomered.com/), the far-right agitator and conspiracy theorist, held a stack of papers that detailed a litany of accusations about ‘disloyal’ members of the [National Security Council](https://www.whitehouse.gov/nsc/). The national security adviser, Michael Waltz, had arrived late and could only watch as [Ms. Loomer](https://loomered.com/) ripped into his staff. Fire them, [Mr. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) instructed Mr. Waltz, according to people with knowledge of the meeting on Wednesday. The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) was furious and demanded to know why these people had been hired in the first place.*

The [Times](https://www.nytimes.com/)’ report, which has not been independently verified by [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) or [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com%), added that the situation “perfectly encapsulates [Mr. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s longtime penchant for soliciting information from dubious sources. The difference now, in [Mr. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s second term, is that he has fewer people around him who try to keep those voices away.”

In a normal and healthy [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), such a cartoonish scenario wouldn’t even be possible. The idea that a sitting [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) would not only meet with someone like [Loomer](https://loomered.com/) but would take her recommendations about national security personnel — as the actual [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) national security adviser watches helplessly — sounds like the script of an unrealistic television show.

But if the [Times](https://www.nytimes.com/)’ account is accurate, that is what happened two months ago, before [Loomer](https://loomered.com/) was rewarded again with one-on-one access to the vice president.

The [Times](https://www.nytimes.com/)’ report from April added that during the [president’s first term](https://trumpwhitehousle.archives.gov/), officials “spent a large portion of their days blocking off people they described as ‘the crazies.’” Those aides have been replaced by others who approach their gatekeeping role very differently.

And therein lies the point: It is hardly a secret that both parties have fringes, but only one party offers the fringe this kind of access and influence.
