## [Why a Trump-appointed FEMA chief was unexpectedly ousted](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/fema-chief-fired-cameron-hamilton-trump-rcna205676)

*One day after acting [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/) chief [Cameron Hamilton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameron-hamilton-90854b299/) defended the agency’s existence to [Congress](https://www.congress.gov=), he was kicked out of his job.*

At face value, [Cameron Hamilton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameron-hamilton-90854b299/) seems like the kind of person who [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his team would like. [Hamilton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameron-hamilton-90854b299/) not only has experience as a [Navy](https://www.navy.mil/) [SEAL](https://www.nsw.navy.mil/) and former combat medic, but just last year, he also ran a [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) congressional campaign in [Virginia](https://www.virginia.gov/).

In fact, when the president appointed him to lead the [Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)](https://www.fema.gov/), Hamilton [actually seemed like one of Trump’s more qualified personnel choices](https://www.fema.gov/profile/cameron-hamilton), given his background as an emergency management specialist at the [State Department](https://www.state.gov/) during [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s first term and his work as the director of the Emergency Medical Services Division at the [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/).

And yet, [Hamilton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameron-hamilton-90854b299/) has been fired anyway. [Politico reported](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/08/fema-chief-fired-cameron-hamilton-00335840):

> *The head of the [Federal Emergency Management Agency](https://www.fema.gov/) was fired Thursday morning, according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation. [Cameron Hamilton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameron-hamilton-90854b299/), [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/)’s acting administrator, has told people that he was terminated, leaving the nation’s disaster agency without a top official three weeks before the start of the Atlantic hurricane season and as [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) scrutinizes [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/)’s proposed budget for fiscal 2026.*

A [Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/) spokesperson [confirmed Hamilton’s departure to NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-administration-britain-tariffs-immigration-doge-live-updates-rcna204764/rcrd78945?canonicalCard=true).

The timing of the developments is striking: Just one day before his ouster, [Hamilton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameron-hamilton-90854b299/) testified before a [House Appropriations Committee](https://appropriations.house.gov/) panel and defended [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/)’s existence, telling lawmakers, “I do not believe it is in the best interests of the American people to eliminate the [Federal Emergency Management Agency](https://www.fema.gov/).”

That might not seem especially notable, since it stands to reason that [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/)’s chief would express public support for [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/). However, [Hamilton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameron-hamilton-90854b299/)’s comments were at odds with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s stated position of wanting to eliminate [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/) — the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has said he [sees the agency](https://x.com/Acyn/status/1882965826682442124) as [an unnecessary department](https://x.com/atrupar/status/1882965415954944258) that should be “[TERMINATED](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/113985962341531654)” — and so, one day later, [Hamilton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameron-hamilton-90854b299/) has found himself out of a job.

Oddly enough, the morning after the congressional hearing, [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Mark Green (T-TN7)](https://markgreen.house.gov/), who chairs the [House Homeland Security Committee](https://homeland.house.gov/), [wrote online](https://x.com/RepMarkGreen/status/1920486501772669281) that [Hamilton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameron-hamilton-90854b299/)’s leadership at [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/) has been “nothing short of amazing.” [Green](https://markgreen.house.gov/) added, “Since taking the helm at [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/), thousands of Americans have seen [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/)’s promises fulfilled, from housing to disaster relief. [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) made the right choice!”

Right around the time the [congressman](https://markgreen.house.gov/) published that message, [Hamilton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameron-hamilton-90854b299/) was kicked out of [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/).

For what it’s worth, a [DHS](https://www.dhs.gov/) spokesperson [told NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-administration-britain-tariffs-immigration-doge-live-updates-rcna204764/rcrd78945?canonicalCard=true) that [Hamilton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameron-hamilton-90854b299/)’s ouster was unrelated to his testimony. Or put another way, the official line is that the firing of the acting [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/) director just one day after he took a public position that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) didn’t like is a coincidence.

Hurricane season begins on June 1.
