title: "Once Again, Trump Is Diverting Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Allocated Money For Illegal Migrants Housing 
---


@RalphHightower: During the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, my wife was talking to her brother, and she mentioned that [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) diverted [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/) funds to illegal aliens. I will refute [Trump‚Äôs lies](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). Since she was on the phone, I texted her, "[FEMA money](https://www.fema.gov/) is [FEMA money](https://www.fema.gov/)." There is a bit of truth that [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/), but it didn't happen on [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/)'s or [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/)'s watch.

## [‚ÄòAlligator Alcatraz‚Äô immigrant detention center in Florida could get FEMA money](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/alligator-alcatraz-florida-detention-trump-fema-immigrants-rcna215109)

*The medieval-style complex of tents on an airfield in the [Everglades](https://www.nps.gov/ever/index.htm) will be used to detain immigrants ‚Äî and surrounded by dangerous reptiles.*

June 25, 2025, 6:27 PM EDT
By [Ja'han Jones](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jahan-jones-ncpn371241)

The [Trump administration](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/iran-bombing-trump-truth-social-diversion-rcna214838) is planning to potentially plunge millions of American tax dollars into a new [anti-immigrant pet project](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/texas-border-wall-funding-abbott-trump-rcna213765) in [Florida](https://www.myflorida.com/) that sounds like it was pulled from medieval times.

You may have heard of the so-called Alligator Alcatraz being constructed in the [Everglades](https://www.nps.gov/ever/index.htm). If not, it‚Äôs basically an old airfield that [Florida](https://www.myflorida.com/) [Republicans](https://www.florida.gop/) are turning into a tent-filled detention facility for immigrants ‚Äî and which will be surrounded by fearsome reptiles.

[As The New York Times reports](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/23/us/politics/florida-alligator-alcatraz-migrant-detention-center.html):
> *The remote facility, composed of large tents, and other planned facilities will cost the state around \$450 million a year to run, but [Florida](https://www.myflorida.com/) can request some reimbursement from the [Federal Emergency Management Agency](https://www.fema.gov/), said Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/).*


> *[Florida](https://www.myflorida.com/)‚Äôs [attorney general](https://www.myfloridalegal.com/), [James Uthmeier](https://www.myfloridalegal.com/ag-bio), a [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) ally who has pushed to build the detention center in the [Everglades](https://www.nps.gov/ever/index.htm), has said the state will not need to invest much in security because the area is surrounded by dangerous wildlife, including alligators and pythons. A spokesperson for the [attorney general](https://www.myfloridalegal.com/ag-bio) said work on the new facility started on Monday morning.*

One might say using [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/) money for such a project ‚Äî after [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has [denied such aid for residents in Democratic-led states ‚Äî](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/fema-north-carolina-washington-recovery-funds-rcna201417) is cruel and deranged.

As the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) also withholds congressionally authorized funding for everything from to [cancer research](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/08/politics/universities-medical-research-funding-frozen-trump-diversity-purge) to [efforts against child sex trafficking](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/robert-kennedy-child-trafficking-biden-health-human-services-rcna204529), this moat ‚Ä¶ thing ‚Ä¶ is apparently a more worthy use of our tax dollars. The plan is part of an effort to help the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) ramp up its mass deportation agenda, which has [ensnared American citizens](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-immigration-crackdown-jose-hermosillo-ice-citizens-rcna202469) and is [largely targeting people with no criminal convictions to speak of](https://www.cato.org/blog/ice-arresting-1100-percent-more-noncriminals-streets-2017) to speak of ‚Äî contradicting [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs campaign rhetoric that his deportations would target hardened criminals.

> *One might say using [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/) money for such a project ‚Äî after [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has denied such aid for residents in [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/)-led states ‚Äî is cruel and deranged.*

As the [Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) noted, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) repeatedly floated the idea of [building a border moat filled with alligators or snakes](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/01/us/politics/trump-border-wars.html) during his [first term](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/). The plan also sounds quite similar to a plan he [floated for homeless people back in 2022](https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-tent-cities-joe-arpaio-rcna40215), which he conceded would be controversial but said would involve ‚Äúhigh-quality tents‚Äù on ‚Äúlarge parcels of inexpensive land in the outer reaches of the cities.‚Äù

Unlike in 2019, when [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs [administration](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/) considered using [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/) money for another archaic anti-immigrant project ‚Äî [a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-considering-diverting-disaster-aid-puerto-rico-several-states-fund-wall-national-emergency/) ‚Äî the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)‚Äôs wish for medieval-style immigration enforcement seems like it‚Äôs on the verge of becoming reality in this case.

It‚Äôs worth noting, though, that the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) already is facing backlash over [reportedly inhumane conditions](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/ice-facilities-conditions-detention-immigrants-rcna214576) being foisted on immigrants in detention centers across the country. And it seems more than a little presumptuous to think treatment will be much better in what effectively is a jail for immigrants encircled by snakes and alligators.
