*Remember the last time a [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) disregarded intelligence to insist a Middle Eastern foe had weapons of mass destruction?*

June 17, 2025, 11:17 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

As [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) prepared to leave the [G7 Summit](https://g7.canada.ca/) in [Canada](https://www.canada.ca/) ahead of schedule, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) took a moment to publish an item to his social media platform, [which read in part](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114695407357588413), “Simply stated, [IRAN](https://irangov.ir/) CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON. I said it over and over again!”

He then said it over and over again. Less than an hour later, he published [a follow-up missive](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114695595047194931) to add, “Somebody please explain to kooky [Tucker Carlson](https://tuckercarlson.com/) that, ‘[IRAN](https://irangov.ir/) CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON!’” In case that was too subtle, six minutes later, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [again wrote](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114695621681197460), “[IRAN](https://irangov.ir/) CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON.”

Soon after, while talking to reporters on [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/), the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) said once again, “[Iran](https://irangov.ir/) cannot have a nuclear weapon, it’s very simple.” But as [The Associated Press reported](https://apnews.com/article/trump-iran-nuclear-israel-g7-132d92f3b5f4014cced1c5029d839ae9), that’s not all he said.

He also dismissed congressional testimony from [National Intelligence Director](https://www.odni.gov/) [Tulsi Gabbard](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence), who told [lawmakers](https://www.congress.gov/) in March that U.S. spy agencies did not believe [Iran](https://irangov.ir/) was building a nuclear weapon. ‘I don’t care what she said,’ [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said. ‘I think they were very close to having it.’

He appeared quite serious about this.

There are a handful of elements to this that are worth keeping in mind.

Right off the bat, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s own [director of national intelligence](https://www.odni.gov/) really did tell the [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Intelligence Committee](https://intelligence.house.gov/) in March that the U.S. intelligence community “continues to assess that [Iran](https://irangov.ir/) is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme leader Khomeini has not authorized the nuclear weapons program that he suspended in 2003.”

What’s more, if [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) prefers to ignore that intelligence and believes that [Iran](https://irangov.ir/) is “very close” to having nuclear weapons, he might want to grapple with the fact that he [abandoned a successful and effective international nuclear agreement with Iran](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-talk-deal-iran-makes-little-sense-rcna174563) during his [first term](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/,), which [necessarily made Iran vastly more dangerous](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-talk-deal-iran-makes-little-sense-rcna174563).

As for [Gabbard](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence), under normal circumstances, when a [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) publicly declares he doesn’t care what his own [director of national intelligence](https://www.odni.gov/) says, that’s generally a sign that it’s time to write a resignation letter.

But as notable as all of these elements are, let’s also not forget recent history: It wasn’t that long ago when the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) had a different [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) who disregarded his own country’s intelligence and insisted that a Middle Eastern foe had weapons of mass destruction.

If memory serves, [that didn’t turn out especially well](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/iraq-war) for anyone.
