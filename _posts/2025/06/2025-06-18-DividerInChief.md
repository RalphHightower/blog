## [In the wake of Minnesota lawmaker shootings, Trump refuses to call Gov. Tim Walz](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-tim-walz-call-minnesota-shooting-rcna213450)

*The [governor](https://mn.gov/governor/) called for “leading with grace and compassion and vision and compromise and decency.” That proved too difficult for the president.*

June 17, 2025, 9:33 AM EDT / Updated June 17, 2025, 9:35 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

In the wake of Saturday’s shootings in [Minnesota](https://mn.gov/), [Gov. Tim Walz](https://mn.gov/governor/about-gov/timwalz/) has heard from current American leaders (Vice President [JD Vance](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-says-wont-call-gov-tim-walz-minnesota-shootings-mess-rcna213432)), former American leaders ([Joe Biden](https://www.axios.com/2025/06/15/trump-walz-minnesota-shooting-lawmakers-call)) and even a foreign leader ([Ontario](http://www.ontario.ca/page/government-ontario) [Premier](http://www.ontario.ca/page/premier) [Doug Ford](https://www.cp24.com/news/2025/06/16/premier-doug-ford-says-all-of-ontario-is-thinking-of-minnesota-following-shooting-of-two-state-lawmakers/)).

The [Democratic governor](https://mn.gov/governor/) has not, however, heard from his own country’s [incumbent president](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).

Shortly after the suspected gunman was apprehended, [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was asked whether he was prepared to reach out to [Walz](https://mn.gov/governor/about-gov/timwalz/) in the wake of the slayings. “Well, it’s a terrible thing,” the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [told ABC News](https://x.com/rachelvscott/status/1934239632121565688) before quickly adding, “I think he’s a terrible governor. I think he’s a grossly incompetent person. But I may, I may call him, I may call other people, too.”

Evidently, the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) has made up his mind. [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-says-wont-call-gov-tim-walz-minnesota-shootings-mess-rcna213432):

> *Days after a [Minnesota](https://mn.gov/) state lawmaker was killed and another injured in a ‘politically motivated assassination,’ [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said on Tuesday that he would not call the [state’s governor](https://mn.gov/governor/), eschewing a traditional presidential response to tragedies.*

“Why would I call him? I could call and say, ‘Hi, how you doing?’ The guy doesn’t have a clue,” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said, referring to [Walz](https://mn.gov/governor/about-gov/timwalz/). “He’s a mess. So I could be nice and call, but why waste time?”

The [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) added, “I think the [governor](https://mn.gov/governor/) of [Minnesota](https://mn.gov/) is so whacked out, I’m not calling him.”

Take a moment to imagine what the reaction would be a left-wing gunman murdered a [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) state legislator and her spouse, and a [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) president not only refused to call the state’s governor, but also decided to publicly condemn that governor in ugly and personal terms.

It would probably generate a reasonable conversation, not only about the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s shattered moral compass[^11], but also about whether the president had lost control of his faculties.

[^11]: @RalphHightower: [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is morally, ethically, and constitutionally bankrupt. 

And yet, here we are.

This isn’t just about niceties. There’s a federal dimension to the case against the alleged shooter — federal prosecutors have already [filed charges against the suspect](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/vance-boelter-arrested-minnesota-suspect-lawmakers-shootings-rcna213202) against the suspect — and a federal component to ensuring the personal safety of elected officials. In other words, even if [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) didn’t want to call [Walz](https://mn.gov/governor/about-gov/timwalz/) as a courtesy, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) could forgo graciousness and talk to the [governor](https://mn.gov/governor/) on a purely substantive level.

But apparently he doesn’t want to.

The [New York Times](https://www.house.gov/)’ [David French noted](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/opinion/donald-trump-second-term-israel-ukraine.html) earlier this year that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) “is at his absolute worst in a crisis.” The columnist, whose observation was unrelated to deadly gun violence, added in reference to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), “He is not a man who is ready to meet important and dangerous moments.”

The [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [keeps proving the point](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/wildfires-crisis-continues-trump-targets-californias-governor-rcna186884). When there was a deadly hurricane in [North Carolina](https://www.nc.gov/), [he flunked a leadership test](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/nc-trump-takes-chance-pretending-fema-lies-are-true-rcna176544). When there was a deadly attack in [New Orleans](https://nola.gov/), [he flunked again](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-reaction-new-orleans-attack-went-bad-worse-rcna186109). When responding to deadly fires in [California](https://www.ca.gov/), [he flunked again](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/wildfires-crisis-continues-trump-targets-californias-governor-rcna186884). In the wake of the [Flight 5342](https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/Pages/DCA25MA108.aspx) crash, [he flunked again](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-rails-dei-response-deadly-american-airlines-army-helicopter-cras-rcna190024). And in the wake of Saturday’s killings in [Minnesota](https://mn.gov/), he’s flunked again.

Over the weekend, the [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [governor](https://mn.gov/governor/) called for “leading with grace and compassion and vision and compromise and decency.” That proved too difficult for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).
