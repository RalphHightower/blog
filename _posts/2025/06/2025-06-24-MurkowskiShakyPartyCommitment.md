## [Lisa Murkowski’s commitment to the Trump-era Republican Party appears increasingly shaky](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/lisa-murkowski-republican-alaska-trump-rcna214708)

*If the [Alaska](https://www.alaska.gov/) [senator](https://www.senate.gov/) does leave the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/), no one in the party can say they weren’t warned.*

June 24, 2025, 9:48 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

As [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Lisa Murkowski](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/)’s new memoir reaches bookstore and library shelves, the [Alaska](https://www.alaska.gov/) [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) appears to have quite a bit to say about [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) — whom she admits she never voted for.

“[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wants to be seen as special and uniquely capable. He seems to have a deep psychological need for that kind of approval. In fact, he has opposite qualities,” [the senator wrote](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-administration-nyc-mayoral-congress-iran-israel-live-updates-rcna214290/rcrd83451?canonicalCard=true). “In my dealings with him as [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), it was evident that he could not have planned his own rise or engineered the transformation of the [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/). He isn’t that smart.”

As part of her promotional efforts for in [“Far from Home: An Alaskan Senator Faces the Extreme Climate of Washington, D.C.,”](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/743990/far-from-home-by-lisa-murkowski-with-charles-wohlforth/) [Murkowski](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/) has also made fresh comments about her party affiliation, some of which have raised eyebrows. [Politico reported](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/06/23/congress/murkowski-as-independent-00419045):

> *[Alaska](https://www.alaska.gov/) [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Lisa Murkowski](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/), one of [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s most vocal critics in the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [GOP](https://www.gop.com/), said in a podcast on Monday that there are certain situations in which she’d consider becoming an independent and caucusing with [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/). ‘There may be that possibility,’ she told Galen Druke in an interview excerpt of his GD Politics podcast, scheduled to post in full on Tuesday.*

“There is some openness to exploring something different than the status quo,” she told the host.

It’s important not to overstate matters, and those expecting an imminent announcement from [Murkowski](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/) about her party label should probably temper their expectations. Indeed, the [Alaskan](https://www.alaska.gov/) specifically [told NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-administration-nyc-mayoral-congress-iran-israel-live-updates-rcna214290/rcrd83426?canonicalCard=true) this week that while she’s “very independent-minded,” she’s not planning to leave the [Republican Party](https://www.gop.com/).

That said, [Murkowski](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/) also[also told Semafor](https://www.semafor.com/article/06/23/2025/murkowski-opens-up-about-caucusing-with-democrats-and-her-private-call-with-trump) that she’s “considered” leaving the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/), adding, “Do I feel that within my [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) conference, I always feel like I’m right here in my political home? No.”

For those who keep an eye on [Capitol Hill](https://www.congress.gov/), comments like these were provocative but not surprising. Just in recent months, [Murkowski](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/) [opposed](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/live-blog/trump-davos-hannity-interview-jan-6-pardons-live-updates-rcna188606/rcrd70356?canonicalCard=true) [Defense](https://www.defense.gov/) [Secretary Pete Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/)’s nomination, [condemned Trump’s Jan. 6 pardons](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/live-blog/trump-administration-executive-orders-presidential-agenda-live-updates-rcna188605/rcrd70211?canonicalCard=true) and [criticized](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/01/trump-zelenskyy-meeting-lisa-murkowski-00206874) the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s willingness to abandon [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/).

Just as notably, in April, [the senator told](https://www.adn.com/politics/2025/04/14/we-are-all-afraid-speaking-to-alaska-nonprofit-leaders-murkowski-gets-candid-on-upheaval-in-federal-government/) a room full of [Alaska](https://www.alaska.gov/) nonprofit leaders, “We are all afraid. It’s quite a statement. But we are in a time and a place where I certainly have not been here before.” At the same event, she described some of the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s recent moves as “unlawful” and “against the law.” She similarly expressed concern about the degree to which [USAID](https://www.usaid.gov/) had “just been obliterated,” described proposed [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) cuts to [Medicaid](https://www.medicaid.gov/) as “devastating” and efforts to politicize the federal judiciary have brought the country to “a very dangerous place.”

More than any [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) in [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/), the [Alaskan](https://www.alaska.gov/) can be [counted on for candor](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/alaskas-lisa-murkowski-says-s-not-attached-republican-label-rcna184131) about the state of her party in the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) era. In fact, late last year, about a month after the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) won a second term, [the senator conceded](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/alaskas-lisa-murkowski-says-s-not-attached-republican-label-rcna184131) that she felt “more comfortable” with no party label than with “an identity as a [Republican](https://www.gop.com/).”

The comments came a few years after [Murkowski](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/) [also said](https://www.adn.com/politics/2021/01/08/alaska-sen-lisa-murkowski-calls-on-president-trump-to-resign-questions-her-future-as-a-republican/), in the wake of the [Jan. 6 attack]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}), “If the [Republican Party](https://www.gop.com/) has become nothing more than the party of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), I sincerely question whether this is the party for me.”

I don’t pretend to know what’s going to happen, but if [Murkowski](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/) does leave the GOP, no one in the party can say they weren’t warned.
