## [Trump’s response to intelligence assessment on Iran strikes takes an incoherent turn](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-response-intelligence-assessment-iran-strikes-takes-incoherent-rcna214937)

*The intelligence about the U.S. strikes on [Iranian](https://irangov.ir/) targets can’t be conclusive and inconclusive at the same time.*

June 25, 2025, 8:57 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

As [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) arrived in the [Netherlands](https://www.government.nl/) this week for an annual [NATO summit](https://www.government.nl/topics/nato-summit-2025), the American [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [reportedly hoped to take](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/24/us/politics/trump-nato-iran.html) a victory lap of sorts, celebrating the success of the preemptive military strikes he approved targeting [Iranian](https://irangov.ir/) nuclear sites. As is often the case with the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/), reality quickly got in the way.

On Tuesday, the world learned of a preliminary intelligence assessment from the [Pentagon](https://www.jcs.mil/)’s [Defense Intelligence Agency](https://www.dia.mil/), which [jolted the public and political debate](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/iran-strikes-assessment-trump-white-house-rcna214844). As [NBC News confirmed](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/middle-east/strikes-iran-set-back-nuclear-program-several-months-sources-say-rcna214853), the initial assessment concluded that the U.S. airstrikes “were not as effective” as [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) claimed, and the mission set [Iran]’s nuclear program “back by only three to six months.”

The day after this assessment reached the public, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) responded to the news in a decidedly [Trumpian](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) way. [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-administration-nato-summit-nyc-election-iran-israel-live-updates-rcna214377/rcrd83636?canonicalCard=true):

> *[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his top [Cabinet officials](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/) are disputing reports that indicate the U.S. airstrikes on [Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities](https://irangov.ir/) set [Iran’s nuclear program](https://irangov.ir/) back by only a few months — despite his initial claim that the U.S. ‘obliterated’ the program. Speaking to reporters in the [Netherlands](https://www.royal-house.nl/) today, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) repeatedly referred to the strikes as causing ‘obliteration.’ He claimed that he thinks the U.S. strikes set [Iran](https://irangov.ir/) back decades.*

Predictably, [Defense](https://www.defense.gov/) [Secretary Pete Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) and [Secretary of State](https://www.state.gov/) [Marco Rubio](https://www.state.gov/biographies/marco-rubio/) [echoed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/25/trump-news-nato-israel-iran/#link-GRDZJV6DBZAD7ISPP2ZQY52LFQ) the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s comments. ([The New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/24/us/politics/trump-nato-iran.html) that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has “closely monitored” which members of his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) have used the specific words he wants to hear.)

There were some key problems with the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)’s rhetoric at his [NATO](https://www.nato.int/) press conference, starting with the fact that he kept contradicting himself in incoherent ways.

Pressed on the efficacy of the mission and the accuracy of the intelligence, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said, “The intelligence was very inconclusive. The intelligence says we don’t know. It could have been very severe. That’s what the intelligence says. So I guess that’s correct. But I think we can take the ‘we don’t know.’ It was very severe. It was obliteration.”

The first part of his answer was at odds with the second. The intelligence can’t be conclusive and inconclusive at the same time. If [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wants to say that it’s too early to have a firm understanding of the strikes’ success, fine. But when he simultaneously declares that the U.S. doesn’t know for sure whether [Iran](https://irangov.ir/)’s nuclear sites were obliterated, and that [Iran’s nuclear sites](https://irangov.ir/) were obliterated, his assertions become plainly unbelievable.

Soon after, at the same event, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said that U.S. intelligence officials “[really don’t know](https://bsky.app/profile/thebulwark.com/post/3lsghzp3c322z)” the full extent of what happened to the [Iranian targets], before adding moments later, “I believe it was total obliteration.”

Or put another way, according to the American [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), U.S. intelligence officials don’t know, but he does know.
The [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) went on to condemn several American news organizations as “[scum](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3lsgm4e2fro2g),” presumably because they reported that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) misled the public when he exaggerated the success of the operation — reporting that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) more or less confirmed when he said “we don’t know” whether the mission was a complete success, while simultaneously saying the opposite.

Even by [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) standards, this has become bizarre. Indeed, he can’t have it both ways. On the one hand, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [wants the public to believe](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/iran-strikes-assessment-trump-white-house-rcna214844) the [Iranian targets](https://irangov.ir/) were “completely and totally obliterated” and “completely destroyed,” [as part of](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114741478150368433) “one of the most successful military strikes in history.” On the other, he also wants the public to believe the intelligence on the mission was “very inconclusive” and the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) simply doesn’t know, despite the initial assessment that concluded that Trump’s claims were simply at odds with the facts.

In recent months, the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) has earned a reputation for dishonesty, recklessness and expressing indifference to his own country’s intelligence. The story of the [Iranian strikes](https://irangov.ir/) he approved has quickly reached the point at which [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is checking all of these boxes at the same time.
