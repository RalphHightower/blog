title: "Current Epstein Saga Is Forgetting About the Victims"

## [Epstein files saga under Trump DOJ and FBI misses the mark — for victims, especially](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/analysis/epstein-files-trump-doj-maga-victims-rcna210046)

*Instead of devoting thousands of hours to document redactions, the agencies should determine how to more effectively — and emphatically — respond to sex abuse victims.*

June 2, 2025, 1:53 PM EDT / Updated June 2, 2025, 2:20 PM EDT
By Lisa Rubin, MSNBC legal correspondent

On Thursday, a woman named Maria Farmer [filed a lawsuit against the](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/jeffrey-epstein-accuser-sues-federal-government-protect-victims-rcna209967) [federal government](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/jeffrey-epstein-accuser-sues-federal-government-protect-victims-rcna209967) that begins with a paragraph both familiar and chilling: “For nearly a quarter of a century,” Farmer charges, Jeffrey Epstein got away with a “wide-ranging sex trafficking venture” in which she was one of hundreds of victims. And worse, Farmer alleges, the high-profile financier was able to do so because the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/), [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) and [United States Attorneys](https://www.justice.gov/usao)’ offices “failed to listen to or protect his sex-trafficked, sexually abused, and sexually exploited victims.”

Indeed, Farmer alleges that she first reported to the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) that she was sexually assaulted by Epstein and his partner [Ghislaine Maxwell](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ghislaine-maxwell-trial-accuser-annie-farmer-testifies-violated-age-16/) in 1996, that she told the agent that Epstein had also committed “multiple serious sex crimes” against other girls and young women, including one of her minor sisters; that Epstein had stolen and transported across state lines nude and partially nude pictures of both of her minor sisters; and that, with others, Epstein was producing and distributing content that could constitute child pornography. (In 2022, Maxwell was [sentenced to 20 years in prison](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/ghislaine-maxwell-sentenced-20-years-prison-conspiring-jeffrey-epstein-sexually-abuse) after a jury convicted her of multiple sex trafficking-related charges; she is currently [serving her sentence in a Tallahassee, Florida, federal prison](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14765909/Questions-Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)s-high-society-friend-Ghislaine-Maxwell-pardoned.html) and [recently asked the Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-1073/355252/20250424150144637_24-__PetitionForWritOfCertiorari.pdf) to overturn her conviction.)

Nonetheless, Farmer alleges, the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) agent hung up on her and never followed up, leaving Epstein to “exponentially" multiply his abuse and trafficking of girls and young women over the ensuing decades. (The [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [declined NBC News' request for comment](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/jeffrey-epstein-accuser-sues-federal-government-protect-victims-rcna209967) on the lawsuit, citing its standard practice of not commenting on litigation.)

> *The existence of Farmer's and others' suits, and the plaintiffs' collective demand that the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) right its wrongs, demands our attention.*

In some respects, Farmer’s lawsuit is not news. That she and her sisters were both victimized by Epstein and allegedly ignored by federal authorities has been [reported for years](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/26/us/epstein-farmer-sisters-maxwell.html). Nor is she the first Epstein victim to sue the federal government for its alleged failure to protect them from his manipulation, abuse and threats. [Another similar suit](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.273105/gov.uscourts.dcd.273105.25.2.pdf) now features 28 plaintiffs who accuse the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) of “gross negligence and reckless indifference” to Epstein and his associates’ sexual abuse and trafficking of them and others for two decades. These lawsuits also seem unlikely to succeed for several reasons, including but not limited to the plaintiffs’ sheer delay in bringing them.

But the existence of Farmer’s and others’ suits, and the plaintiffs’ collective demand that the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) right its wrongs, demands our attention. That’s especially true because what the victims seem to most want from the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) — accountability for their ongoing trauma and internal reform to ensure something like the Epstein saga never recurs — contrasts with the growing MAGA-world hunger for more information about Epstein’s crimes, his co-conspirators and [his suicide](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/dan-bongino-kash-patel-jeffrey-epstein-rcna209871), which many in [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-world have [baselessly alleged](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-retweets-epstein-conspiracy-theory-claiming-clinton-connection-n1041146) was actually a murder.

That pressure has been escalating since February, when [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) [released a couple hundred pages](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/hyped-release-epstein-files-sparks-anger-disappointment-right-rcna194087) of documents, most of which had already been disclosed publicly.

The February release spurred many — including [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) herself — to angrily accuse the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) of concealing relevant records and/or to continue speculating about which famous or otherwise distinguished Americans were complicit in Epstein’s sex trafficking ring. [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/,) were not the only disappointed audience; [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Dan Goldman](https://goldman.house.gov/), a prominent [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/,) and [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) critic, [characterized the release](https://goldman.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-dan-goldman-demands-ag-bondi-release-promised-jeffrey-epstein-files-share) as “a ham-handed attempt to gaslight the American people” while asking whether [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), who knew and socialized with Epstein long before entering political life, “intervened to prevent the public release of the Epstein files in order to hide his own embarrassing and potentially criminal conduct.”

> *From the victims' perspective, of course, how Epstein died, much less how he lived, is a secondary, if not needlessly salacious, detail.*

In early May, [Bondi told reporters](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article305900636.html) that the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) was “diligently” going through “tens of thousands of videos of Epstein with children or child porn” involving “hundreds of victims” whose identities would need to be protected in any release of such materials. Yet [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) remains [under scrutiny by other Trump allies](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kash-patel-dan-bongino-epstein-death-conspiracy-theories-rcna207785) who either doubt that she has such records, including because of a belief that prior Justice Department officials have destroyed them, or because they're simply impatient to learn whether Epstein had ties to the U.S. government or “specific intelligence agencies.”

And in the meantime, to apparently relieve some of the Epstein-related anxiety, [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Deputy Director Dan](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/deputy-director-dan-bongino) [Bongino himself pledged](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/dan-bongino-kash-patel-jeffrey-epstein-rcna209871) last week to release surveillance video from the Manhattan federal jail where Epstein died, which both [Bongino](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/deputy-director-dan-bongino) and [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Director Kash Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) now say demonstrate that Epstein was alone in his cell that night and therefore died of suicide.

But from the victims’ perspective, of course, how Epstein died, much less how he lived, is a secondary, if not needlessly salacious, detail. From their own experiences, they know what he did, to whom and with whom.

What the victims deserve — beyond the continued privacy to which [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) rightfully has said they are entitled — is not an [“all hands on deck” review,](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/epstein-case-review-fbis-new-york) review, redaction, and possible release of sickening videos or Epstein case file documents by agents who’ve been [diverted from national security matters](https://abcnews.go.com/US/doj-pushes-fbi-review-release-epstein-files-amid/story?id=119982513).

What they deserve is a [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) and an [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) willing to examine and reform their own procedures for handling sexual assault and trafficking reports. After all, it's been more than two years since [Farmer's lawyer wrote the FBI and DOJ a 15-page letter](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23795557/letter-re-jeffrey-epstein-calling-for-investigation-of-fbi-w-exhibits.pdf) asking for "a comprehensive investigation to determine why there was and remains such abject failure to timely investigate, expose, and prosecute this unprecedented, decades-long criminal conspiracy."

That kind of internal investigation and reform may not satiate those still poring over [Epstein’s little black book —](https://www.justice.gov/ag/media/1391321/dl?inline) — but it would get closer to real justice for his victims.
