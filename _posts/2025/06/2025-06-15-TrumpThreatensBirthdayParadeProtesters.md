## [Trump threatens military parade protesters, says dissenters will face 'very heavy force'](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-threatens-military-parade-protesters-says-dissenters-will-face-h-rcna212282)

*The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)'s lengthy record of trying to silence critics is unambiguous. Ahead of his military parade, it's getting worse.*

June 11, 2025, 8:55 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

[Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has wanted a military parade down the streets of [Washington, D.C.](https://dc.gov/), [for many years](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/faced-soaring-price-tag-trumps-military-parade-unravels-msna1134586), and this weekend, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) will get his wish. By all appearances, he’s delighted.

“We’re going to have a fantastic June 14th parade on Flag Day,” [Trump told reporters](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-wildfire-briefing-oval-office-june-10-2025/) on the [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) on Tuesday. “It’s going to be an amazing day. We have tanks. We have planes. We have all sorts of things. And I think it’s going to be great.”

Of course, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is a highly controversial figure; his idea about having tanks roll down the streets of the nation’s capital is not universally popular; and because the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/)’s [First Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/) still exists, there’s a reasonably good chance that some of the folks who show up for Saturday’s parade will be there to express their disagreement with the display.

As [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-warns-military-parade-protesters-will-face-heavy-force-rcna212136), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) shared some thoughts about them, too.

> *[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) warned Tuesday that anyone who protests at the U.S. military parade here on Saturday will be met with ‘very heavy force.’ [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) told reporters in the [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) that they’re going to be ‘celebrating big on Saturday,’ referring to the parade that will wind its way through downtown [Washington, D.C.](https://dc.gov/)*

In context, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [wasn’t asked](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-wildfire-briefing-oval-office-june-10-2025/) about the possibility of protesters at the parade, but he nevertheless volunteered a threat.

“For those people that want to protest, they’re going to be met with very big force,” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said. “And I haven’t even heard about a protest, but you know, this is people that hate our country, but they will be met with very heavy force.”

Right off the bat, it continues to be bizarre to see [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) question the patriotism of his critics. Memories are often short in politics, but in the runup to [Election Day 2024](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/2024presgeresults.pdf), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) condemned the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) as, among other things, a “garbage can.” Ours is a “failing nation” and a “nation in decline,” he added. Told in October 2024 that [America](https://www.usa.gov/) is a great country, the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) said — out loud and on the record — that he disagreed.

It’s a detail to keep in mind as he tries to claim the high road on patriotism and love of country.

But even more important was the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s willingness to publicly threaten [Americans](https://www.usa.gov/) who participate in protests that haven’t yet happened. Note, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) made no distinction between those who might peaceably assemble and those who might engage in criminal misconduct. In other words, he didn’t say rioters would face “very heavy force”; he said protesters would face “very heavy force.”

Memories are often short in politics, but in the runup to [Election Day 2024](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/2024presgeresults.pdf), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [condemned the United States](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/tale-two-closing-messages-harris-offers-patriotism-rejects-trumps-chao-rcna177986) as, among other things, a “[garbage can.](https://x.com/atrupar/status/1849884232585302222)” Ours is a “failing nation” and a “nation in decline,” he added. Told in October 2024 that [America](https://www.usa.gov/) is a great country, the [Republican](https://www.gop.com5) said — out loud and on the record — that [he disagreed](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/election-day-nears-trump-embraces-conditional-patriotism-rcna174812).

In other words, he didn’t say rioters would face “very heavy force”; he said protesters would face “very heavy force.”

The message was unsubtle: [Americans](https://www.usa.gov/) who disagree with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) should expect to be crushed if they try to exercise their rights under the [First Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/). Indeed, the message came against a backdrop of the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [questioning the legitimacy and authenticity](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/paid-insurrectionists-unrest-l-trump-returns-unsettling-old-favorite-rcna212142) of those who oppose his agency.

What’s more, there’s a larger pattern to consider. As a [New York Times report](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/10/us/politics/trump-military-parade-protests.html) noted, [Trump’s former [Pentagon](https://www.defense.gov/) secretary, Mark Esper, has repeatedly claimed that the president [pushed to shoot protesters in the legs in 2020](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/former-defense-secretary-trump-asked-shooting-protesters-rcna26891). Years earlier, remarking on the 1989 democratic protests in Tiananmen Square, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) celebrated the [Chinese](https://www.gov.cn/) response as a demonstration of “[the power of strength.](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/tiananmen-square-trump-what-he-sees-power-strength-n1222161)”

Or put another way, when the world saw the image of a student standing in front of tanks, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) sided with the guys driving the tanks.

There was some political conversation a few years ago about the [Republican Party](https://www.gop.com/) positioning itself as “the party of free speech.” There’s a reason those who espoused such a position have grown awfully quiet lately.
