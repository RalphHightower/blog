title: "Dumb and Dumber, The Sequel: Vice President JD “John Boy” Vance Is Dumber Than His President. Bless His Heart"

## [JD Vance is trying — and failing — to justify Trump's Iran airstrikes](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/jd-vance-iran-dumb-presidents-trump-war-rcna214476)

*The [vice president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/)'s defense of airstrikes on [Iran](https://irangov.ir/) rests on the absurd claim that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) isn't as "dumb" as his predecessors.*

June 23, 2025, 2:57 PM EDT
By [Zeeshan Aleem](https://www.msnbc.com/author/zeeshan-aleem-ncpn1235332)

[Vice President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) [JD Vance is one the most vocal anti-interventionists](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/jd-vance/iran-vance-intervention-skeptic-role-salesman-rcna214345) in [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s inner circle — which makes watching him try to come up with arguments to justify [Trump's airstrikes on nuclear sites in Iran](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/us-bombs-iran-nuclear-sites-trump-rcna214311) this weekend such a tragicomic spectacle.

“I certainly empathize with Americans who are exhausted after 25 years of foreign entanglements in the Middle East,” [Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) told [NBC](https://www.nbcnews.com/)'s [Kristen Welker](https://www.nbcnews.com/author/kristen-welker-ncpn6396) on ["Meet the Press"](https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press-full-episodes) on Sunday. “I understand the concern, but the difference is that back then, we had dumb presidents, and now we have a president who actually knows how to accomplish America’s national security objectives.”

> *[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has created a scenario which by its very nature opens up the possibility of a sustained war with Iran.*

“This is not going to be some long drawn-out thing," he added.

But what evidence do we have of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s exceptional powers of judgment and wisdom relative to his predecessors?

Is it that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [shirks intelligence briefings?](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/09/trump-intelligence-briefing-frequency-00338946)? Is it his decision to [surround himself with loyalists](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-iran-israel-war-hegseth-gabbard-loomer-bannon-rcna214170) who labor to confirm his instincts, instead of experts who counsel him based on facts? Is it his [manic reversals (and then reversals of his reversals) of his own policies,](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-tariffs-relief-farmers-automakers-economy-rcna203935), and [inability to explain](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/23/business/endgame-trumps-tariffs) why he's doing what he's doing? Is it his transparent disinterest in policy details? His fixation on the [presidency](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) as reducible to optics and stagecraft? Is it that he turns [to the propagandistic Faux News](https://www.vox.com/2017/8/7/16083122/breakfast-club-fox-and-friends) — which is [largely enthusiastic about strikes on Iran](https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/trumps-fox-news-obsession-driving-us-toward-war-iran) — for advice on how to run the country?

These are, of course, the kinds of qualities that should make the public extremely skeptical that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) will exercise discipline and careful long-term analysis as he appraises the escalating situation with [Iran](https://irangov.ir/). Case in point: the same day [Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) said that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was only pursuing targeted strikes against [Iran](https://irangov.ir/)'s nuclear program, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [implied on social media that pursuing regime change in Iran was possibly on the table](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-strikes-against-iran-nuclear-facilities-incredible-overwhelming-success-2025-06-22/).

But in some respects [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s intellect is beside the point. Because he has created a scenario which by its very nature opens up the possibility of a sustained war with Iran.

[NBC News reports](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/iran/iran-trump-nuclear-israel-bombing-what-next-rcna214328) that "In the days before [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) gave the final order for the attack on the nuclear sites, [Iran](https://irangov.ir/) sent a private message to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) that it would respond to such a move by unleashing terrorist attacks on U.S. soil carried out by sleeper cells operating inside the country, according to two U.S. officials and a person with knowledge of the threat." If such an attack were to actually happen, there is little doubt that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) could feel compelled to respond.

On Monday, [Iran](https://irangov.ir/) [launched missile attacks](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/middle-east/live-blog/live-updates-iran-top-diplomat-meets-putin-us-braces-retaliation-rcna214428/rcrd83359?canonicalCard=true) on a U.S. military base in [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/), which could in turn precipitate another round of tit-for-tat with the [U.S. Defense](https://www.defense.gov/) [Secretary Pete Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) said Sunday, before the attack, that the U.S. would “act swiftly and decisively when our people, our partners or our interests are threatened.” In other words, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has set in motion a face-off that could conceivably spiral into a full-fledged war on [Iran](https://irangov.ir/).

[Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) says this time will be different because [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is not a "dumb" president. A wise president would know that we wouldn't have to have been contemplating this entire scenario if [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) had not taken the extreme step of striking Iran in the first place.
