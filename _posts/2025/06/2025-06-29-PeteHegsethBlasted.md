## [Nicolle Wallace blasts Hegseth over performative news conference on Iran strikes](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/nicolle-wallace-pete-hegseth-pentagon-meltdown-rcna215527)

*[Wallace](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/nicolle-wallace-biography-n1157571) said the [defense](https://www.defense.gov/) [secretary](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-expresses-interest-rolling-back-clock-bring-back-department-war-rcna215029) did little to resolve the issue that’s “haunting” the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) in the wake of Saturday’s strikes.*

June 27, 2025, 12:45 PM EDT
By [Allison Detzel](https://www.msnbc.com/author/allison-detzel-ncpn1310186)

[Nicolle Wallace](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/nicolle-wallace-biography-n1157571) called out [Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-expresses-interest-rolling-back-clock-bring-back-department-war-rcna215029) over his [performative news conference](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/iran-strike-pete-hegseth-press-conference-trump-rcna215226) on Thursday, which she argued did little to resolve the issue “haunting” the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) in the wake of [the United States’ airstrikes on Iran](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-attack-iran-nuclear-threat-rcna214411).

That issue, according to [Wallace](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/nicolle-wallace-biography-n1157571), revolves around one key question: “Has [Iran](https://irangov.ir/)’s nuclear program been — as [Donald Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/donald-trump) asserted Saturday night and has repeated every day since — ‘obliterated’?”

During his remarks Thursday, [Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) repeated [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s claim that the facilities had been [“obliterated.”](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-iran-strikes-nuclear-site-assessment-ceasefire-rcna214803) However, as [Wallace](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/nicolle-wallace-biography-n1157571) noted, the chairman of the [Joint Chiefs of Staff](https://www.jcs.mil/), [Gen. Dan Caine](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4154293/general-dan-caine/), refused to use that word when describing the results of the strike. [Wallace](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/nicolle-wallace-biography-n1157571) said [Caine](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4154293/general-dan-caine/)’s choice encapsulated “the whole issue that’s being debated.”

“Were the strikes successful in terms of hitting targets? Yes. But did the strikes deliver the result that the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) says they did, and says they wanted?” [Wallace](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/nicolle-wallace-biography-n1157571) asked.

[Wallace](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/nicolle-wallace-biography-n1157571) also tore into [Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) over his [treatment of the media](https://x.com/atrupar/status/1938217272792789296) during the news conference. “Here’s what happened when [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/)’ [Pentagon](https://www.jcs.mil/) reporter, [Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/)’s former colleague, [Jennifer Griffin](https://www.foxnews.com/person/g/jennifer-griffin), asked the incredibly important and respectful and relevant question whether the [Iranians](https://irangov.ir/) moved uranium out of the Fordo site,” [Wallace](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/nicolle-wallace-biography-n1157571) said, before playing a clip of [Griffin](https://www.foxnews.com/person/g/jennifer-griffin) and [Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/)’s exchange, during which the defense secretary personally attacked his former colleague and accused her of being “about the worst” at intentionally misrepresenting what [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) says.

[Wallace](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/nicolle-wallace-biography-n1157571) also praised [Griffin](https://www.foxnews.com/person/g/jennifer-griffin) for standing up for herself and her reporting:

That was America’s [secretary of defense](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) saying to [Faux](https://www.foxnews.com/)’s highly respected, highly credible, highly experienced [Pentagon](https://www.jcs.mil/) correspondent, ‘Jennifer, you’re the worst.’ And you saw her there take issue with the assessment and go on to defend her reporting, none of which has been disproven. It’s just a taste of what happened today at the [Pentagon](https://www.jcs.mil/) from the [secretary of defense](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/), whose salary is paid for by all of our taxpayer dollars.

Retired U.S. Army Lieutenant General Mark Hertling joins [Nicolle Wallace](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/nicolle-wallace-biography-n1157571) on [Deadline White House](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house) with reaction to the performative press conference staged by [Defense](https://www.defense.gov/) [Secretary Pete Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) where he did little to provide actual information about the strike in [Iran](https://irangov.ir/), and used the time to lash out at the media for reporting on the initial intel report that disputes [Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) and [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s claims that the [Iran]'s nuclear facilities were obliterated.
