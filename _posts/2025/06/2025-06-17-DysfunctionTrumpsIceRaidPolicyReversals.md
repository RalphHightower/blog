@RalphHightower: [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) raids targeting farm workers will raise the price of food and potentially cause shortages st grocery stores. 

## [Team Trump reverses course on ICE raids policy, as White House dysfunction worsens](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-reverses-ice-raids-deportations-farmers-agriculture-rcna213462)

*The [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s policy on [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) raids and deportations changed, then changed again, then changed back — all over the course of just five days.*

Throughout [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s first term as [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), people around him to came to realize that if their voice was the last one he heard, their preferred position was likely to prevail. It’s easy to understand why.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has never been interested in the substance of policymaking, and he’s never had much of a governing vision, so officials learned that when the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) reached a fork in the road, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) tended to agree with whomever he spoke to last.

Five months into the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)’s second term, this dynamic hasn’t changed at all. [The Washington Post reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/06/16/trump-farms-hotels-immigration-raids/):

> *The [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/) on Monday told staff that it was reversing guidance issued last week that agents were not to conduct immigration raids at farms, hotels and restaurants — a decision that stood at odds with [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s calls for mass deportations of anyone without legal status.*

According to the [Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/)’s report, which hasn’t been independently verified by [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com) or [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/), [Immigration and Customs Enforcement](https://www.ice.gov/) officials started the week with a telephone meeting with field offices, directing agents to “continue conducting immigration raids at agricultural businesses, hotels and restaurants,” despite the opposite guidance last week.

If you’re thinking that this bouncing ball has been tough to follow, you’re not alone.

Last week, [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) border czar [Tom Homan said](https://www.semafor.com/article/06/12/2025/trump-will-target-us-employers-in-next-phase-of-immigration-crackdown-homan-says) said the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) would intensify its campaign of targeting undocumented immigrants at U.S. worksites, adding that enforcement operations “are going to massively expand.” A day later, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) went in the opposite direction, conceding that his mass deportation agenda was [hurting farmers and the domestic hospitality industry](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/rare-acknowledgement-trump-concedes-deportations-are-hurting-us-busine-rcna212634) and vowing “changes.”

Soon after, the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) said the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s policies [wouldn’t change](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/13/trump-immigrant-farm-workers-hospitality/). Soon after that, the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s policies did change, and ICE was directed to [pause raids and arrests](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/13/us/politics/trump-ice-raids-farms-hotels.html) in the agricultural industry and at hotels and restaurants.

Four days later, the pause — a reversal of an earlier [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) policy — was itself reversed.

Officials haven’t offered an explanation for the erratic swings, though if recent history is any guide, it’s likely that someone swayed the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) in one direction last week, before a different member of his team gained access to his ear and swayed him in the opposite direction soon after.

In a Monday post on [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s meandering policy, [I asked](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-mass-deportation-policy-becomes-meandering-moving-target-rcna213247), “What will the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s agenda look like in another day or two?” Little did I know that just 13 minutes later, the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) would direct ICE to disregard the guidance agents had received late last week.

In a functional and well-run [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/), mercurial shifts like these don’t happen. On [Team Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), however, they happen far too often, on far too many issues.
