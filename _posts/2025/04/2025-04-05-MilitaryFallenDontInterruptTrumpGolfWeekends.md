*The four [Army](https://www.army.mil/) soldiers died in a training exercise in Lithuania. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) chose to attend his personal business partners‚Äô dinner Thursday and play golf Friday.*

By S.V. Date. Apr 4, 2025, 12:23 PM EDT

WASHINGTON ‚Äì [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) skipped the return of the remains of [four soldiers who died](https://apnews.com/article/missing-us-soldiers-lithuania-armored-vehicle-fc5501ee70303fa64fe5620d59095c2f) in a training exercise to [Dover Air Force Base](https://www.dover.af.mil/) on Friday and instead spent millions of taxpayer dollars to attend a dinner for one of his business interests and to play golf.

The bodies of the four members of the [Army](https://www.army.mil/)‚Äôs [3rd Infantry Division](https://home.army.mil/stewart/units/3ID) ‚Äî Sgt. Jose Duenez Jr., 25, of [Joliet](https://www.joliet.gov/), [Illinois](https://www.illinois.gov/); Sgt. Edvin F. Franco, 25, of [Glendale](https://www.glendaleca.gov/), [California](https://www.ca.gov/); Staff Sgt. Troy S. Knutson-Collins, 28, of [Battle Creek](https://battlecreekmi.gov/), [Michigan](https://www.michigan.gov/); and Pfc. Dante D. Taitano, 21, of [Dededo](https://www.mcog.guam.gov/villages-list), [Guam](https://www.guam.gov/) ‚Äï were returned to [Delaware](https://www.dover.af.mil/) for their [‚Äúdignified transfer‚Äù ceremony](https://www.dover.af.mil/) Friday morning. They died when their [70-ton armored M88 towing vehicle](https://www.army.mil/article/284222/additional_recovery_assets_arrive_in_support_of_recovery_efforts_in_lithuania) sank in a bog in [Lithuania](https://lrv.lt/) last week.

While the ceremony took place on the [Air Force](https://www.af.mil/) base tarmac, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was 900 miles south at his [golf course in West Palm Beach, Florida](https://www.trumpinternationalpalmbeaches.com/), across the Intracoastal Waterway from his [Palm Beach country club](https://www.maralagoclub.com/).

A [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) administration official, on condition of anonymity, said that ‚Äúthe families requested no media at the transfer‚Äù and that the ‚Äú[White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is respecting their request for privacy today and has been working on correspondence to the families.‚Äù

However, [presidents](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) in the past have attended [dignified transfers](https://www.dover.af.mil/) while their accompanying press pools have been held in a location away from the ceremony. The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) did not respond to a query about why that did not happen in this case.

While [Trump typically goes to Florida](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-golf18-million_n_67cb892fe4b02f3ad1f4b2bb) for his \$3.4 million golf weekends on Fridays, he traveled a day early this week to attend a closed-door dinner at his [Doral golf resort](https://www.trumpgolfdoral.com/) for the Saudi [LIV tour](https://www.livgolf.com/), one of his business partners that holds events at his courses.

This trip, though, will cost taxpayers at least \$4.2 million because of the detour to [Miami International Airport](https://miami-airport.com/), which is located just two miles east of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs [Doral resort](https://www.trumpgolfdoral.com/). [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) nevertheless took a Marine helicopter to fly to the golf course and back rather than ride in his motorcade.

Friday was [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs 16th day of golf at the [West Palm course](https://www.trumpinternationalpalmbeaches.com/) and his 20th day at one of his courses since taking office Jan. 20, meaning that as of Friday, he has played golf on 27% of his days in office in his second term. The total cost to taxpayers for transporting him and his security apparatus to and from those venues these past 11 weeks is now \$30.4 million, according to a HuffPost analysis.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), who under the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/)‚Äôs [‚Äúemoluments clause‚Äù](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S1-C7-1/ALDE_00000233/) is not permitted to accept payments except for his official salary, has nevertheless been using his official position to help the [LIV tour](https://www.livgolf.com/). In February, days after returning to office, he [hosted](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/17/us/politics/trump-ethics-conflicts-business-adams.html) the head of the [Professional Golf Association](https://www.pgatour.com/) in the [Oval Office](,https://www.whitehouse.gov/), from where he participated on a conference call with the head of the [LIV tour](https://www.livgolf.com/). [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has been open about trying to get the two rival golf organizations to merge, which, if it happens, would boost [LIV](https://www.livgolf.com/) and therefore himself.

LIV has since its inception used [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs courses for its tournaments and is holding its fourth such tournament at [Doral](https://www.trumpgolfdoral.com/) this weekend. The [Trump Organization](https://www.trump.com=), the umbrella company for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs various business interests, did not respond to HuffPost queries about how much LIV has paid for the use of the golf courses.

That [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) would put his personal finances and his golf hobby ahead of honoring U.S. service members, while unusual for a [president](https://www.https://www.whitehouse.gov/), is in character with his [previous treatment](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-military-signal-chat_n_67e5fcd8e4b0da7de427383c) of the military. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) famously refused to go out in the rain for a ceremony honoring [U.S. Marines](https://www.marines.mil/) who died in WWI during the 100-year anniversary of Armistice Day in France. His own [chief of staff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/susiewiles/) at the time confirmed that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) called service members who died for the United States ‚Äúsuckers‚Äù and ‚Äúlosers.‚Äù
