## [Elon Musk calls Peter Navarro a ‘moron’ as White House divisions burst into public view](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/elon-musk-calls-peter-navarro-moron-white-house-divisions-burst-public-rcna200272)

*Asked about the intensifying feud between [Elon Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk/) and [Peter Navarro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-navarro-93167122/), the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) said, "Boys will be boys." It's not nearly that simple.*

Late last week, simmering tensions between [Peter Navarro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-navarro-93167122/), [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s top adviser on trade policy, and [Elon Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk/) started to boil over. It led a [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) host to ask [Navarro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-navarro-93167122/) on Sunday, “[Peter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-navarro-93167122/), is there a rift internally?” [Navarro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-navarro-93167122/) replied, “No. ... It’s fine. There’s no rift here.”

He might want to revise that answer. [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/elon-musk-zero-tariff-free-trade-zone-europe-rcna199849):

[Elon Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk/) on Tuesday blasted [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s top trade adviser, [Peter Navarro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-navarro-93167122/), as a “moron” and “dumber than a sack of bricks” in a spat that underscores the discord among the president’s top allies over his sweeping tariffs set to go into effect this week.

Let’s take a moment to review how we arrived at this point.

After considerable behind-the-scenes scuttlebutt about [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) tensions over the president’s policy on tariffs, the fissures started to reach the public late last week, when [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk/) [took a veiled rhetorical shot](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1908392805841371225) at [Navarro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-navarro-93167122/) via social media — though [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s top campaign donor did not mention [Navarro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-navarro-93167122/) by name.

A day later, [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk/) delivered public remarks in which he made clear that [he disagreed with Trump’s trade tariffs](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/elon-musk-zero-tariff-free-trade-zone-europe-rcna199849), though he again made no specific references to [Navarro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-navarro-93167122/), who’s helping steer the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s tariffs policy.

The day after that, [Navarro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-navarro-93167122/) appeared on [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) and said that [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk/) “didn’t understand” what he was talking about on tariffs. [He added](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3lm5obh5otz2o), “Look, [Elon](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk), when he’s in his [DOGE](https://www.doge.gov/) lane is great, but we understand what’s going on here? Do we just have to understand? [Elon](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) sells cars, and he’s in [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) [assembling cars](https://www.tesla.com/) that have big parts of that car from [Mexico](https://www.gob.mx/), [China](https://www.gov.cn/), batteries come from [Japan](https://www.japan.go.jp/), or [China](https://www.gov.cn/), electronics come from [Taiwan](https://www.taiwan.gov.tw/), and he’s simply protecting his own interests, as any business person would do.”

[Navarro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-navarro-93167122/) concluded, “We don’t mind him saying whatever he wants, but just the [American people](https://www.usa.gov/) need to understand that we understand what that’s all about.”

The following morning, [Navarro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-navarro-93167122/) made another on-air appearance, this time on [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/). “When it comes to tariffs and trade, we all understand in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), and the [American people] understand that [Elon](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)’s a car manufacturer]
, but he’s not a car manufacturer, he’s a [car assembler](https://www.tesla.com/), in many cases,” the trade adviser said, adding, “He’s a car person, that’s what he does. And he wants the cheap foreign parts, and we understand that, but we want them home.”

Given that [Navarro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-navarro-93167122/) and [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk/) are ostensibly [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) colleagues, it wasn’t altogether clear who Navarro was referring to when he used the word “we.”

This cleared the way for [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk/) to use his social media platform [to write](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1909604085025956133), “[Navarro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-navarro-93167122/) is truly a moron” [and](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1909605316121198860) “[Navarro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-navarro-93167122/) is dumber than a sack of bricks.”

The billionaire soon after [added](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1909607096267760093), “[Navarro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-navarro-93167122/) should ask the fake expert he invented, [Ron Vara](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-navarro-93167122/)” — a reference to the unfortunate fact that [Navarro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-navarro-93167122/) invented a fictional expert whom he quoted in his books in support of his ideas. (“[Ron Vara](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-navarro-93167122/)” in an anagram for “[Navarro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-navarro-93167122/).”)

Asked about the dispute, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt [told reporters](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3lmcyt3oid32s), “Boys will be boys.” The problem with the assessment, however, is that [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk/) and [Navarro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-navarro-93167122/) are grown men with incredibly powerful and influential jobs, helping steer a radical policy agenda that is shaping global events.

Their dispute, in other words, is not the stuff of playgrounds.

I won’t pretend to know how this will shake out in the [West Wing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), though it’s worth noting that the last time [Musk clashed with colleagues at the White House](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/rubios-tenure-secretary-state-reaches-new-lows-reported-white-house-te-rcna195656), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) reportedly allowed the back-and-forth to continue, “[as if he were watching a tennis match](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/us/politics/trump-musk-doge-power.html).”

In a normal [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/), a [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) would intervene and prevent this feud from continuing, if no other reason than to signal to the public that the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is united behind a single vision — and not a [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) divided against itself. There’s no reason, however, to expect Team Trump to act like a normal administration.
