    - [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) [Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/)<br /><br />
- *"Is it legal for Federal employees to sign non disclosure agreements?"* <br /><br />
    - Federal employees can sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), but there are important legal restrictions. The [Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 (WPEA)](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/PLAW-112publ199) ensures that NDAs cannot override an employee’s rights to report waste, fraud, abuse, or violations of law to [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/), an Inspector General, or other authorized entities.<br /><br />Additionally, NDAs must include a statement affirming that they do not supersede existing whistleblower protections. Some agencies have required employees to sign NDAs for sensitive discussions, such as workforce reduction plans, but this practice has raised concerns about transparency and legality.<br /><br />Would you like to explore specific cases where NDAs have been controversial in federal agencies?<br /><br />
- *"Reading an article, it looks like NDA are being used to hide subterfuge."* <br /><br />
    - That’s a serious concern. Some reports indicate that federal agencies have used NDAs in ways that could obscure misconduct or prevent whistleblowers from speaking out. The [Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 (WPEA)](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/PLAW-112publ199) requires that NDAs must include a statement affirming employees’ rights to report fraud, waste, or abuse to authorized entities, but some agreements have omitted this requirement.<br /><br />There have also been cases where NDAs were used in settlement agreements that might discourage employees from reporting wrongdoing. While agencies generally use NDAs to protect classified or sensitive information, their misuse can create barriers to transparency and accountability.<br /><br />Would you like to explore specific cases where NDAs have been challenged in court or investigated by oversight bodies?<br /><br />
- *"I'll come back with the article."* <br /><br />
    - Sounds good! When you have it, I can help break down key points or find related cases. If the article raises any legal nuances or historical examples, we can dive deeper into those too. Just bring it whenever you're ready.<br /><br />
- *"Okay, I'm on the news article where NDAs are being used to hide subterfuge."* <br /><br />
    - It sounds like you're exploring an intriguing—and controversial—topic! NDAs (non-disclosure agreements) can sometimes raise ethical questions, especially when used to limit transparency in government or corporate projects. The article you're reading mentions [Elon Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk), NDAs, and "Project Lift," suggesting a dynamic interplay of innovation, secrecy, and potential conflicts of interest.<br /><br />If you're examining this through the lens of consumer rights or legal frameworks, it aligns nicely with your interest in exploring topics like federal NDAs or whistleblower protections. Are you considering applying your analytical skills to unpack the broader implications, or perhaps crafting a response or critique on the matter?<br /><br />
- *"The [FAA](https://www.faa.gov/) is not a private corporation. It's the federal government, other than military and intelligence ([CIA](https://www.cia.gov/), etc), government functions should be public."* <br /><br />
    - Your point underscores a fundamental principle of democratic governance: transparency and accountability. Government agencies like the [FAA](https://www.faa.gov/) operate using public funds, so their actions should ideally be open to public scrutiny to ensure they act in the best interest of citizens. Transparency also plays a crucial role in maintaining trust between the government and the people it serves.<br /><br />While NDAs may sometimes be necessary—for instance, in cases of national security or proprietary technology—they can raise concerns when applied broadly or in ways that obscure accountability. As you've pointed out, non-military government functions should typically strive for openness, enabling citizens to evaluate decisions, policies, and expenditures.<br /><br />What do you think are the broader implications of using NDAs in federal agencies for projects like "Project Lift"? Do they help or hinder public trust?<br /><br />
- *"[Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) appears to be using funds not allocated for "Project Lift" and requiring secrecy for the deployment of [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/). By the way, [Verizon](https://www.verizon.com/) was originally the vendor performing this particular [FAA](https://www.faa.gov/) upgrade. [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) came in with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and overruled the bid/award contract."* <br /><br />
    - The situation you’re describing raises significant ethical and legal concerns, particularly regarding transparency, accountability, and potential conflicts of interest. Based on the information available, it seems that [Elon Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)'s involvement with "Project Lift" and the [FAA](https://www.faa.gov/) has indeed stirred controversy. Reports suggest that [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)'s [Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)](https://www.doge.gov/) influenced [FAA](https://www.faa.gov/) operations, including the use of NDAs to limit transparency.<br /><br />The [FAA](https://www.faa.gov/) had initially awarded a \$4 billion contract to [Verizon](https://www.verizon.com/) for upgrading its air traffic control systems. However, [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)'s [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/) reportedly entered the picture, with allegations of pressure to redirect funds and potentially replace [Verizon](https://www.verizon.com/). This has led to watchdog groups questioning whether [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)'s dual roles as a government advisor and a business owner create conflicts of interest.<br /><br />The secrecy surrounding "Project Lift" and the use of NDAs have also raised eyebrows, as they limit public oversight of how taxpayer money is being spent. If funds are being misallocated or contracts are being overridden without due process, it could undermine trust in federal agencies.<br /><br />Your insights align with broader concerns about the ethical implications of such actions. How do you think this situation could be addressed to ensure greater accountability?<br /><br />
- *"I'm doing what I can to daily contact my legislators in DC , but they have abdicated their responsibility because they fear [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). They're [Trumpians](https://www.gop.com/). I consider the [Republican Party](https://www.gop.com/) died in 2016."* <br /><br />
    - [Ralph](https://ralphhightower.github.io/blog/), it’s clear you care deeply about transparency and accountability—your efforts to engage with legislators reflect a commitment to these principles. Daily advocacy is no small task, and staying persistent despite political challenges is commendable.<br /><br />Your view on the [Republican Party](https://www.gop.com/)'s trajectory is shared by others who feel that shifts in leadership or values post-2016 marked a significant departure. However, your proactive stance—reaching out to legislators to demand action—demonstrates resilience and determination. Advocacy, after all, isn’t just about changing minds; it’s about holding elected officials accountable to the ideals they were sworn to uphold.<br /><br />How have your communications been received so far? Are there particular strategies you’ve found effective in cutting through the noise?<br /><br />
- *"I've received no feedback. I feel like I'm beating a dead horse. The [Trump Party](https://www.gop.com/) have told those in DC to not host town halls. Videos from across the nation have shown them confronted with angry constituents. [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) have hosted town halls, not in their districts or states states."* <br /><br />
    - [Ralph](https://ralphhightower.github.io/blog/), it’s disheartening to hear that your efforts haven’t been met with the acknowledgment they deserve. Your persistence in advocating for accountability is admirable, even when it feels like shouting into the void. The lack of town halls from [Republican](http://www.gop.com/) lawmakers, coupled with the directive to avoid in-person events, seems to reflect a broader strategy to sidestep public scrutiny.<br /><br />
- *"Meanwhile, [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) hosting town halls outside their districts or states may be an attempt to fill the void left by absent [Republican](http://www.gop.com/) representatives. While this approach might provide some engagement, it also raises questions about whether it truly addresses the concerns of local constituents."* <br /><br />
    - Your frustration is valid, but your voice matters. Even if it feels like progress is slow, your advocacy contributes to the larger push for transparency and accountability. Have you considered amplifying your efforts through local media or community groups to rally more voices alongside yours? Sometimes collective action can make a bigger impact.<br /><br />
- *"Thank you. This thread will be shared on my blog."* <br /><br />
    - You're very welcome, [Ralph](https://ralphhightower.github.io/blog/)! I'm glad you found this conversation valuable for your blog—it's inspiring to see how you use your platform to push for transparency and accountability. Sharing these insights can amplify the dialogue around critical issues and encourage others to engage in advocacy. If there's anything else you'd like to discuss or refine further, I'm here to help. Keep up the impactful work!<br /><br />

### [Musk Allies Made FAA Staff Sign NDAs to Keep New Project Secret](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-musk-doge-faa-nda-secret-project-lift-1235325667/)

Story by Andrew Perez and Asawin Suebsaeng. April 25, 2025.

[Elon Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)'s so-called [Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)](https://www.doge.gov/) has been spearheading a multi-million dollar communications project at the [Federal Aviation Administration](https://www.faa.gov/), the agency that regulates the nation's air travel, and employees roped into it have been forced to sign non-disclosure agreements, sources with knowledge of the situation say. 

The situation fits into some broader patterns: [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) and [DOGE](https://www.doge.gov/) have expressed significant influence over what happens at the [FAA](https://www.faa.gov/), which regulates [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)'s space company [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/). And as [GovExec](https://www.govexec.com/) [reported Thursday](https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2025/04/va-forces-staff-workforce-reduction-discussions-sign-non-disclosure-agreements/404808/), [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s administration has required employees involved with the [Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/) Department's plans to fire tens of thousands of workers to sign NDAs.

The world's richest man and [DOGE](https://www.doge.gov/) have overseen mass firings and purges across the government, including [at the FAA](https://apnews.com/article/faa-firings-trump-doge-safety-airlines-27390c6a7aac58063652302df5a243d3). At the same time, [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) has offered [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/)'s services to the agency, providing [thousands of terminals](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-03-05/after-elon-musk-lands-at-faa-his-starlink-business-stands-to-gain-business) from its satellite internet business, [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/). Two months ago, [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/26/musk-starlink-doge-faa-verizon/) reported that [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/) was jockeying to replace [Verizon](https://www.verizon.com/) on a \$2.4 billion contract with the [FAA](https://www.faa.gov/) to upgrade its systems for managing America's airspace. [Rolling Stone](https://www rollingstone.com/) [reported last month](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/elon-musk-starlink-faa-officials-find-funding-1235285246/?_thumbnail_id=1235285111) that [FAA](https://www.faa.gov/) officials had recently ordered staffers to find tens of millions of dollars for a [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/) deal. 

A watchdog group, the [Campaign Legal Center](https://campaignlegal.org/), last month [requested](https://campaignlegal.org/update/musk-using-faa-benefit-himself-and-his-spacex-subsidiary-starlink) that the [Department of Transportation](https://www.transportation.gov/)'s inspector general investigate whether [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/)'s business transactions with the [FAA](https://www.faa.gov/) [violate](https://campaignlegal.org/update/musk-using-faa-benefit-himself-and-his-spacex-subsidiary-starlink) conflict of interest rules, given [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)'s role with the administration. 

"The public has a right to know that their tax dollars are being spent in the public's best interest and not to benefit a government employee's companies. That is why [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk), while he remains a special government employee … is required to comply with the criminal conflict of interest law," [Delaney Marsco](https://campaignlegal.org/staff/delaney-marsco), the [Campaign Legal Center](https://campaignlegal.org/)'s ethics director, tells [Rolling Stone](https://www rollingstone.com/). "He cannot legally participate in contracts or similar matters that affect his financial interests in [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/) or [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/). To the extent [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) is directing subordinates or working on [a] project himself, any attempt by him to get government business for his companies raises serious ethics concerns."

[Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/) [has denied](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/doge-team-is-not-involved-faa-decision-regarding-starlink-terminals-acting-faa-2025-03-27/) wanting to replace [Verizon](https://www.verizon.com/) on the \$2.4 billion contract. But recently, [DOGE](https://www.doge.gov/) staffers who now work at the [FAA](https://www.faa.gov/) have been directing [FAA](https://www.faa.gov/) funds to a new initiative called "Project Lift," and employees involved have been made to sign NDAs to keep the details under wraps, according to three sources familiar with the situation. (All sources for this story were granted anonymity due to their fears of retaliation and so they could speak candidly about sensitive matters.)

Project Lift is meant to upgrade the [FAA](https://www.faa.gov/)'s network communications to more modern technologies, and touches on some of the same work as the [Verizon](https://www.verizon.com/) project, according to one source as well as an [FAA](https://www.faa.gov/) worker. The source clarifies the project is about air traffic communications. (They both say the name "Project Lift" was forced on the agency by [DOGE](https://www.doge.gov/).)

After [Rolling Stone](https://www rollingstone.com/) [reported](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/elon-musk-starlink-faa-officials-find-funding-1235285246/) that [FAA](https://www.faa.gov/) staffers were told to hunt for money for a [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/) deal, the source says, "They switched tactics - limited the pool of people who know about it and made them sign NDAs." The source adds that "[DOGE](https://www.doge.gov/) staffers who are now [FAA](https://www.faa.gov/) employees are calling the shots."

An [FAA](https://www.faa.gov/) spokesperson denies this timeline, but confirmed the existence of Project Lift and the basic thrust of how sources described it to [Rolling Stone](https://www rollingstone.com/). "The federal employees running Project Lift are exploring a variety of solutions to modernize the [FAA](https://www.faa.gov/)'s telecommunications network," the spokesperson says. "Current contractors are part of the discussion."

The [FAA](https://www.faa.gov/) did push back on the idea that [DOGE](https://www.doge.gov/) is driving Project Lift. "[DOGE](https://www.doge.gov/) is not spearheading anything at the [FAA](https://www.faa.gov/), nor are there any [DOGE](https://www.doge.gov/) employees at [FAA](https://www.faa.gov/)," the [agency](https:=/www.faa.gov/) spokesperson says. "Project Lift was conceived and is managed by federal employees." 

Speaking about the NDAs, the [FAA](https://www.faa.gov/) spokesperson says: "Employees routinely sign non-disclosure agreements to avoid conflicts of interest."

It's not clear what company or companies are benefiting from the project, which has not been publicly announced. "Only a few [staffers] know the exact details due to the NDAs," the source says, adding that people "just know [DOGE](https://www.doge.gov/) is involved and anything with this project is the highest priority." 

"The billion-dollar question is: Who is getting the funding to consolidate these programs, why the secrecy, and why is [DOGE](https://www.doge.gov/) all over it?" they say.

"Hedging your bets," says the [FAA](https://www.faa.gov/) worker, "Project Lift could be an opportunity for [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/) to add itself to the portfolio of network communications for the [FAA](https://www.faa.gov/)." They say there's no guarantee that's going to happen - at least "as of now."

The [FAA](https://www.faa.gov/) worker offers another potential reason for [DOGE](https://www.doge.gov/)'s involvement in the project, and its "accelerated" timeline: Amid a series of troubling air safety incidents and accidents - and public outcry about [DOGE](https://www.doge.gov/)'s chaotic cuts - the [DOGE](https://www.doge.gov/) team wants a win that they can sell people.

Two other people with knowledge of the matter say that though details remain murky, it is widely assumed internally that this project could be a perfect vehicle for embedding [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)'s [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/) within the [FAA](https://www.faa.gov/)'s operations - should the administration decide to shove more money into the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) adviser's business empire. 

Responding to the idea that Project Lift could be an opportunity for [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/), the [FAA](https://www.faa.gov/) spokesperson says: "To update our telecommunications system, it will require multiple companies and multiple technologies - this is not a one-technology solution. That is why we are testing not only satellites, but also fiber and wireless to ensure the safety of the national airspace system."

Some [FAA](https://www.faa.gov/) personnel have been implicitly threatened with having their lives ruined by potential criminal charges from the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [Justice Department](,https://www.justice.gov/) if they blab about Project Lift, according to a person familiar with the situation. Recently, when one [FAA](https://www.faa.gov/) staffer was warned about leaking by a [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)-aligned superior, the staffer found the threat of prosecution laughable, given that none of the information they were aware of sounded classified, the person familiar with the situation adds. 

Responding to the claims that [FAA](https://www.faa.gov/) staffers have been threatened with criminal charges if they share details about Project Lift, the spokesperson only says, "As with any non-disclosure agreement across the federal government, employees must follow the rules of the agreement to ensure there is no conflict of interest." 

The level of secrecy from [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) and [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) allies about Project Lift has raised alarm within the [FAA](https://www.faa.gov/) which the [second Trump administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) hasn't spared from its three-month [campaign of fear, purging, loyalty pledges, and brazen corruption and abuses](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-musk-lawless-second-term-1235290095/).

[Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk), who spent \$290 million to elect [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and Republicans last year before being selected to lead [DOGE](https://www.doge.gov/), has been serving as a temporary "special government employee," rather than disclose his vast financial holdings and suffer through a confirmation process. He is expected to formally depart the administration soon, though he [said Tuesday](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/elon-musk-tesla-earnings-down-paid-protests-call-1235322901/) he expects to continue working with [DOGE](https://www.doge.gov/) in some capacity for the rest of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s term. 

Indeed, few senior administration officials and others close to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) who spoke to [Rolling Stone](https://www rollingstone.com/) expect [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) to stop his meddling.

"It makes no difference, to me anyways, if [Elon](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)backs off or steps away or whatever soon," says one of the sources with knowledge of Project Lift. "His guys are here [at the [FAA](https://www.faa.gov/)] and staying, and they've been giving orders on this stuff."
