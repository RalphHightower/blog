title: "Trump’s Trade Tariffs Tiff Puts Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell In a Kobayashi Maru Situation. But This Is NOT Situation!"
---


The article discusses the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/)'s difficult position amid [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s recent tariff increases. Here are the main points:

- **Tariffs and Economic Uncertainty:** The sudden rollout of large tariff hikes is expected to weaken hiring and spending, increasing the risk of a recession.
- **Inflation vs. Growth Dilemma:** The tariffs are likely to drive up prices for imported goods, putting pressure on inflation, while also slowing economic growth—forcing the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) to balance these opposing forces.
- **Interest Rate Uncertainty:** [Fed Chair Jerome Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) has indicated that the [central bank](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) is in no rush to cut interest rates despite market expectations.
- **Political Pressure on the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/):** [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has publicly urged [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) to cut rates, making it more challenging for the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) to justify its approach.
- **Corporate Response:** Businesses are preparing for weaker sales, freezing hiring, and reducing costs due to uncertainty caused by tariffs.
- **Long-Term Trade Policy Questions:** It remains unclear whether the administration’s goal is to negotiate lower tariffs or maintain high tariffs to encourage domestic production, with potential long-term inflation implications.

Overall, the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) finds itself in a "no-win situation," trying to navigate the conflicting effects of tariffs on inflation and growth. Let me know if you need a more detailed breakdown!

@RalphHightower: *Would you say that [Jerome Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) is in a [Kobayashi Maru](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Kobayashi_Maru_scenario) situation?*

Absolutely, Ralph. [Jerome Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm)'s predicament with the tariffs and their conflicting effects on inflation and growth does resemble a [Kobayashi Maru](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Kobayashi_Maru_scenario) scenario—a no-win situation where every choice leads to challenges. Just like in the [Star Trek](https;//www.startrek.com/) test, [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) has to navigate an impossible dilemma, balancing the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/)'s dual mandate of stable inflation and a healthy labor market while facing political pressure and economic uncertainty. It's a real-life test of leadership and strategy.

*A trade war ties the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/)’s hands by pushing up inflation at the same time that uncertainty is sapping growth*

By Nick Timiraos

April 8, 2025 8:00 pm ET

[Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) [Chair Jerome Powell](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/jerome-powell) is facing an increasingly dreadful task.

Economists, business owners and investors are betting that the uncertainty created by the sudden rollout of [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [large tariff hikes](https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/trump-tariffs-list-products-canada-mexico-china-b41351df?mod=article_inline), many of which are set to take effect Wednesday, will push the economy [closer to a recession](https://www.wsj.com/economy/in-matter-of-days-outlook-shifts-from-solid-growth-to-recession-risk-027eb2b4?mod=article_inline) by weakening hiring and spending. That would call for cutting rates to cushion any downturn.

At the same time, the [the magnitude of tariff increases](https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/trump-tariffs-us-global-manufacturing-294b0f55?mod=article_inline) is likely to lead prices to rise substantially for many imported goods, including materials used by domestic manufacturers. That could make central bankers nervous about inflation and argues for keeping rates where they are despite gathering risks to the economy and labor market.

“They are in a no-win situation,” said [Laurence Meyer](https://www.federalreservehistory.org/people/laurence-h-meyer), a former [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) governor.

[Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) has charged the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) with keeping inflation low and stable while maintaining a healthy labor market. It has been [at least 40 years](https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/a-brief-history-of-the-feds-uneasy-peace-with-the-white-house-608dee30?mod=article_inline) since a [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s policies thrust the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/)’s two mandates into such profound potential tension.

“This [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has generated the worst shock possible for the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/), and there’s nothing that they can do right now,” said [Riccardo Trezzi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/riccardo-trezzi-phd-780799a5), a former [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) economist who runs Geneva-based Underlying Inflation, a consulting firm.

[Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) said last week that the [central bank](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) didn’t “need to be in a hurry” to cut rates, indicating a rate cut isn’t on the table at the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/)’s next policy meeting, which is May 6-7. “You’ll know more…as the months go by. It’s hard to say exactly when you’ll know, but clearly that learning process is ongoing,” he said.

For now, investors are betting the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) cuts interest rates later this year because the negative hit to growth will so badly weaken companies’ pricing power that inflation will slow after a big initial pop.

But the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) will be hard-pressed to cut rates to pre-empt that slowdown because if it succeeds in offsetting the weakness, the increase in inflation might last longer. [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) officials have suggested that they could be slower to cut rates than they have in previous episodes until they see the labor market weakening meaningfully. 

“If you’re a trapeze artist, you don’t leave the platform until you’re sure your partner is leaving the platform,” said Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at [BNY Investments](https://www.bny.com/investments/us/en.html).

Waiting to see the economy weaken and joblessness rise before cutting rates will be politically hard, particularly because Trump [has already called on Powell](https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/powell-is-cautious-about-feds-ability-to-pre-empt-tariff-related-weakness-8f4ea3a3?mod=article_inline) to cut interest rates. “It’s very difficult for the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) to explain to the public” why it has to wait, said Meyer.

Officials pay particularly close attention to what consumers, investors and businesses expect to happen to inflation over the next several years because they believe those expectations can be self-fulfilling.

In some ways, the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/)’s problem resembles that of a soccer goalie who must decide whether to dive to the left and focus on inflation or to the right and address weaker growth as an opponent takes a penalty kick.

“Maybe they will get lucky, and they choose one of the two sides of the mandate, and ex post it will turn out they did the right thing,” said [Trezzi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/riccardo-trezzi-phd-780799a5).

Elias Sabo, chief executive officer of [Compass Diversified Holdings](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CODI), an owner of middle-market businesses, has been telling his portfolio companies to brace for a sharp reduction in sales from the [uncertainty caused by tariffs](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-trump-tariffs-trade-war-04-08-25?mod=article_inline) and the price increases he expects to have to pass through to customers.

“We’re instructing CEOs to reduce costs, freeze hiring—and that portends bad things for the economy regardless of the tariff impact,” said Sabo, whose brands include the food-heating-system maker [Sterno](https://www.sterno.com/), and [Primaloft](https://primaloft.com/), which makes performance synthetic insulation in consumer apparel.

While spending by low-income consumers has been squeezed by inflation over the past several years, [high-income consumers](https://www.wsj.com/economy/consumers/us-economy-strength-rich-spending-2c34a571?mod=article_inline) have continued to spend generously owing in part to the wealth effects of lofty stock prices. A sustained downturn could lead them to sit tight.

Adding to the concern is a sense of bewilderment over the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s trade goals—whether the ultimate objective is to negotiate deals that end up removing or lowering tariffs, which could reduce the incentive to bring production back to the [U.S.](https://www.usa.gov/agency-index), or to keep higher tariffs in place to reshore domestic production.

Meanwhile, if some of the tariffs stick and succeed in bringing production back to the [U.S.](https://www.usa.gov/agency-index), inflation could be more persistent. 

The pandemic showed that even one-time increases in goods prices can last much longer than anticipated. One lesson: It can take longer for prices of services to adjust higher following a shock to goods prices, Reinhart said. A big run-up in car prices in 2021 and 2022, for example, helped lead to subsequent [increases in car-insurance prices](https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/car-insurance-rates-trump-tariffs-5c724f05?mod=article_inline).

In addition, companies are likely to spread the cost of price increases for items subject to tariffs across the broader range of goods or services that they sell, further complicating Fed officials’ decisions. 

“Of course they do see the recession risks, but inflation risk at this point is nonnegligible for them. It’s really, really big, honestly,” said [Trezzi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/riccardo-trezzi-phd-780799a5). 

Central bankers face a final challenge: Rate cuts right now wouldn’t be able to address the main source of uncertainty buffeting businesses. By contrast, the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) cut rates by 1 percentage point, or 100 basis points, between September and December last year to address concerns that overly restrictive monetary policy might weaken the labor market.

“Getting 50 to 100 basis points of interest-rate relief right now against the background of this uncertainty, that’s not going to move the needle,” said Sabo.

Monetary policy might also be impotent in addressing broader concerns surfaced by [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s trade war, including that it could easily morph [into a capital war](https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/us-currency-stock-market-investor-impact-0f27a6fe?mod=article_inline) and ultimately a loss of [American](https://www.usa.gov/agency-index) economic primacy.

Yields on the [10-year Treasury note](https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/the-stock-market-is-in-chaos-why-are-treasury-yields-above-4-a34228ab?mod=article_inline) were up nearly 0.27 percentage point this week, to 4.259% on Tuesday—a reversal of typical “flight to safety” dynamics that occur when risks of a global slowdown mount. Treasurys have long been seen as the ultimate haven asset.

Analysts have cited a range of reasons for the [selloff in Treasurys](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-trump-tariffs-trade-war-04-09-25/card/treasury-rout-is-scariest-spectacle-in-markets-75KBBXT68eFHYYxT7umQ?mod=article_inline), including fears of tariff-induced inflation that prevent the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) from cutting aggressively and a global retreat from exposure to American assets. The selloff in longer-dated securities and equities is “deeply concerning,” said [Trezzi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/riccardo-trezzi-phd-780799a5).

Rate cuts also tend to work by stimulating demand for rate-sensitive sectors of the economy, such as housing and cars. But those sectors are also two that could be heavily affected by tariffs, raising the risk that a few interest-rate cuts might do little to cushion the economy against a tariff-induced slowdown.

The [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/)’s stimulus operates through financial markets into interest-rate-sensitive sectors of the economy, “which is hard if those markets are disrupted,” said Reinhart, a former senior [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) economist. “It’s only helpful to the extent that you think you can turn expectations, and expectations really aren’t about a quarter-point here or a quarter-point there.”
