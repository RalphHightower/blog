*[Trump Media](https://tmtgcorp.com/) is asking the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) to investigate a firm that predicted the company’s stock will fall.[^11]*

[^11]: @RalphHightower: [Trump Media and Technology Group](https://tmtgcorp.com/) wouldn't be the first [Trump business](https://www.trump.com/) to fail.

By Ja'han Jones

The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s media company [investigate a firm that bet against it](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/trump-media-presses-us-regulator-investigate-short-positions-its-stocks-2025-04-17/), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/) is reporting.

It’s the kind of story you might expect to read about in a tin-pot dictatorship. But this is the new American “golden age,” as [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s media company, [Trump Media and Technology Group](https://tmtgcorp.com/), has called on the [SEC](https://www.sec.gov/) to probe U.K.–based company [Qube Research and Technologies](https://www.qube-rt.com/) for betting against it to the tune of \$105 million.

As [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/) [reports](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/trump-media-presses-us-regulator-investigate-short-positions-its-stocks-2025-04-17/):

> *[Trump Media](https://tmtgcorp.com/), which is 53% owned by [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and is the parent company of the [Liars Club](https://truthsocial.com/) platform, said in a memo sent to the [SEC](https://www.sec.gov/) on Thursday it was concerned [Qube](https://www.qube-rt.com/)’s short positions could involve “suspicious activity.” Short selling is a controversial practice that often comes under scrutiny during times of market turmoil. Executives typically criticize such trading, which is legal, while some activists point out they have uncovered corporate misconduct. “We urge you to immediately investigate this suspicious trading and report your findings back to [TMTG](https://tmtgcorp.com/) and any relevant civil and criminal authorities,” the memo said.*

[Qube](https://www.qube-rt.com/) told [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/) and [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-media-sec-investigate-qube-hedge-fund-shorting-djt-stock-2025-4) that its financial decisions regarding [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s media company were based on a quantitative model, not the company’s fundamentals. [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/) noted that “shares of [Trump Media](https://tmtgcorp.com/) have plunged 39% year to date and are down 62% from their late-October peak.” (Neither [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) nor [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/) have independently verified [Trump Media](https://tmtgcorp.com/)’s memo to the [SEC](https://www.sec.gov/).)

[Trump Media](https://tmtgcorp.com/)’s revenues “declined 12% year over year [in 2024], according to its [annual report](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1849635/000114036125004822/ef20039039_10k.htm). The [company](https://tmtgcorp.com/) saw its net loss widen to \$400.9 million from \$58.2 million in 2023,” [CNBC reported](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/14/trump-media-djt-earnings-report-2024.html) in February.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has said his stake in [Trump Media](https://tmtgcorp.com/) is held in a trust controlled by his son [Donald Trump Jr.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donald-trump-jr-4454b862/), although experts told [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) that arrangement doesn’t [preclude any conflicts of interest](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/20/business/trump-media-donald-trump-trust.html). The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), however, claimed that [Trump Media](https://tmtgcorp.com/)’s request to the [SEC](https://www.sec.gov/) posed no conflict in an email to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/), and neither [Trump Media](https://tmtgcorp.com/) nor [Qube](https://www.qube-rt.com/) responded to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/)’ request for comment.

The red flags seem obvious. The fact the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) continues to own a stake in any media company while in office is unprecedented. That [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is the majority owner of a [media company](https://tmtgcorp.com/) that accepts investments, [foreign](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/swiss-national-bank-bought-trump-media-shares/) and [domestic](https://fortune.com/2024/11/23/trump-media-stock-djt-investor-retirement-funds-truth-social/), is its own parade of red flags, [particularly as he wages war on the free press](https://www.msnbc.com/katy-tur/watch/trump-urging-fcc-chair-to-punish-cbs-to-the-max-is-right-out-the-authoritarian-playbook-cook-237344837688). Now his [media company](https://tmtgcorp.com/) is asking the government that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) oversees to probe a firm that bet against that company, and it seems like a scenario ripe for self-dealing.

The memo also comes as [Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/14/critics-slam-deregulation-of-crypto-as-trump-family-expands-its-footprint-in-industry) [has](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/14/critics-slam-deregulation-of-crypto-as-trump-family-expands-its-footprint-in-industry) [install](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/14/critics-slam-deregulation-of-crypto-as-trump-family-expands-its-footprint-in-industry) [cryptocurrency-friendly officials at the agency](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/14/critics-slam-deregulation-of-crypto-as-trump-family-expands-its-footprint-in-industry) that enforces rules on investments like the currencies he and his family have launched. It seems like [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is organizing the [SEC](https://www.sec.gov/) as an agency to benefit his own personal businesses, perhaps more than anything else.
