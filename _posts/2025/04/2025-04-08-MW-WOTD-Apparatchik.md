title: "Merriam-Webster’s WOTD (Word Of The Day): Apparatchik. Appropriate For the Trump Administration & Trump Party"
---


Today's [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/)'s [Word of the Day (WOTD)](http://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day/2025/04/08/) is [apparatchik](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/apparatchik). The definition is appropriate for [Trump’s](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), his [cabinet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/), and [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/), so I created a blog post of the [Trumpers](https://www.gop.com/). Anyway, I got sucked into a rabbit hole and forgot why I went to [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/).

I'll add the [Trumpians](https://www.gop.com/) in the [House of Representatives](https://www.house.gov/) and [Senate](https://www.senate.gov) once I create the list.

## [Merriam-Webster's Word of the Day for Apr 8 is "apparatchik":](http://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day/2025/04/08/)

What It Means

[Apparatchik](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/apparatchik) is used disapprovingly to refer to a blindly devoted official, follower, or member of an organization, such as a corporation or political party.

// This generation of graduates wants more out of life than to become establishment [apparatchiks](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/apparatchik).

[See the entry >](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/apparatchik)

"Played by What We Do in the Shadows' Matt Berry, Shazbor is a faithful party apparatchik and staunch defender of his country's traditions ..." — Damon Wise, Deadline, 25 Jan. 2025

Did you know?

The apparat in [apparatchik](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/apparatchik) (a term English speakers borrowed from Russian) essentially means "party machine," with machine referring to a highly organized political group under the [leadership of a boss](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) or small group of individuals: apparatchik originally referred to someone functioning as a cog in the system of the [Communist Party](https://www.gop.com/). The term is not a flattering one, and its negative connotations reflect the perception of some [Communists](https://www.gop.com/) as obedient drones in the [great Party machine](https://www.gop.com/). In current use, however, a person doesn't have to be a member of the [Communist Party](https://www.gop.com/) to be called an [apparatchik](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/apparatchik); they just have to be someone who mindlessly follows orders in an organization or bureaucracy.
