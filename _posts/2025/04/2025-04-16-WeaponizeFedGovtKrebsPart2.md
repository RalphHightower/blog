- [Trump Weaponizes Federal Government to Persecute Truth Told By Cybersecurity Expert Chris Krebs]({% link _posts/2025/04/2025-04-10-WeaponingGovtAgainstChrisKrebs.md %})

## [White House struggles to defend Trump’s orders targeting officials who defied him](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-house-struggles-defend-trumps-orders-targeting-officials-defied-rcna201500)

*The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) had a week to come up with a defense for [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s orders targeting [Christopher Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/) and [Miles Taylor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miles-taylor-65707671/). It apparently came up empty.*

Even those who’ve come to expect [Donald Trump’s authoritarian tactics](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/24-hours-trump-makes-authoritarian-style-vision-plain-rcna201288) tactics were taken aback last week when the president signed two [first-of-their-kind executive orders](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/authoritarian-fashion-trump-orders-probes-two-ex-officials-defied-rcna200574) targeting a pair of officials from his first term who defied him.

There was barely a pretense in the executive orders that the targeted former officials — [Christopher Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/), who led the [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)](https://www.cisa.gov/), and [Miles Taylor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miles-taylor-65707671/), a former high-ranking [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/) official — had done anything wrong. Indeed, the closer one looked at the stated rationales in support of the directives, [the more ridiculous they appeared](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/04/10/trump-krebs-election-denialism/).

Nevertheless, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) directed [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) and the [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/) to launch a “review” into [Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/), while simultaneously ordering [DHS](https://www.dhs.gov/) to investigate [Taylor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miles-taylor-65707671/).

It took nearly a week, but a reporter — in this instance, [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/)’ Jonathan Swan — finally asked the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) to make some kind of effort to defend [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s actions.

“The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has long said that it would be an abuse of power for a president to direct prosecutors to investigate him,” Swan noted. “Last week, [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) explicitly directed the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) to scrutinize [Chris Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/) to see if it can find any evidence of criminal wrongdoing. How is that not an abuse of power, to direct the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) to look into an individual — a named individual?”

I watched the clip of Leavitt’s response several times, hoping to make sense of it. This was her answer in its entirety:

> *Look, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) signed that [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-addresses-risks-from-chris-krebs-and-government-censorship/). It’s the position of the president in this [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) that it’s well within his authority to do it, otherwise he wouldn’t have signed it. And he signed it, and that’s his policy.*

The question was whether Trump abused his power by directing the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) to pursue a named individual — who did nothing wrong, but who the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) doesn’t like. According to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s chief spokesperson, this was proper because the White House believes [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has the authority to do this.

The circular reasoning is breathtaking: [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) can abuse his power because the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has concluded that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) can abuse his power, therefore there’s nothing wrong with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) abusing his power.

By this reasoning, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) can — effectively, if not literally — do anything he wants, just so long as it’s the position of the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) that his actions are legitimate.

Remember, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and [his team](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) had plenty of time to come up with talking points on this. They could carefully and methodically craft a specific defense on the merits and present that pitch to the public.

Evidently, they couldn’t come up with anything, which says a great deal about the propriety of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s tactics.

I can appreciate why the media landscape is crowded, but I [continue to believe](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-can-sic-justice-department-critics-perceived-enemies-s-rcna200897) this should be more than a one-day story. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) — who ran on an authoritarian-style platform, who’s trying to concentrate power while expressing indifference to the rule of law — ordered investigations into Americans he doesn’t like.

He has [an enemies list](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/07/us/trump-revenge-list.html), and last week, he began using the power of the [presidency](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) to target some of those on that list, despite the inconvenient fact that their only “crime” was telling truths [Dear Leader](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) didn’t want to hear.

If the pushback is muted, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) will do what he’s always done: assume that he can get away with such an abuse, while preparing to go even further down the same radical and dangerous path.

Not to put too fine a point on this, but if the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) can sic the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) on his critics and perceived enemies and this isn’t seen as a dramatic scandal, who’ll be next? How far down his enemies list will he go?

I’m reminded anew of J. Michael Luttig, a prominent conservative legal scholar put on the federal bench by [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [George H.W. Bush](https://www.bush41.org/) who published [a Bluesky thread](https://bsky.app/profile/judgeluttig.bsky.social/post/3lmhwiybck22k) on the orders, calling them “shameful” and “constitutionally corrupt” and accused [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) of “palpably unconstitutional conduct.”

The fact that the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) still can’t come up with a credible defense for the orders, a week later, helps bolster Luttig’s point.
