## [Judge blasts ‘fallacy’ of Trump administration’s Abrego Garcia ‘facilitation’ word games](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/kilmar-abrego-garcia-facilitate-judge-paula-xinis-rcna201495)

*The [federal government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s attempt to avoid returning the mistakenly deported man “runs contrary to law and logic,” [Judge Paula Xinis](https://www.mdd.uscourts.gov/paula-xinis-district-judge) wrote.*

The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) [argued](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mdd.578815/gov.uscourts.mdd.578815.65.0.pdf) that its court-ordered duty [to “facilitate”](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-kilmar-abrego-garcia-deportation-supreme-court-rcna201104) Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s U.S. return is limited to removing any “domestic obstacles” to that return. But the federal judge presiding over the case called that a “fallacy.”

[U.S. District](https://www.mdd.uscourts.gov/) [Judge Paula Xinis](https://www.mdd.uscourts.gov/paula-xinis-district-judge) gave two reasons for her conclusion in an [order](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mdd.578815/gov.uscourts.mdd.578815.79.0.pdf) following Tuesday’s hearing over the [government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s efforts (or lack thereof) to remedy its [illegal](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24a949_lkhn.pdf) deportation of Abrego Garcia to [El Salvador](https://www.gob.sv/), a country to which a different judge [previously ruled](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mdd.578815/gov.uscourts.mdd.578815.1.1_3.pdf) he couldn’t be sent. The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) not only sent him and others to that country without due process but specifically to a [notorious prison](https://www.usnews.com/photos/2025/04/15/photos-inside-el-salvadors-mega-prison) there.

First, [Xinis](https://www.mdd.uscourts.gov/paula-xinis-district-judge) wrote, the federal [government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has taken more expansive facilitation efforts in the past. In a lengthy footnote (on Page 5 of her [order](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mdd.578815/gov.uscourts.mdd.578815.79.0.pdf)), the [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) appointee cited several examples of the [government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) taking international action, including bringing someone back from Haiti “with assistance from the [United States Marshal Service](http://www.usdoj.gov/marshals/), which manned the Government airplane that flew to [Haiti](https://www.primature.gouv.ht/) to retrieve” them.

[Xinis](https://www.mdd.uscourts.gov/paula-xinis-district-judge)’ second and more fundamental point was that officials apparently have done “nothing” to aid in Abrego Garcia’s release as ordered by the [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) last week, [which said](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24a949_lkhn.pdf) the [government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) had to “ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to [El Salvador](https://www.gob.sv/).” The judge said the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s “attempt to skirt this issue by redefining ‘facilitate’ runs contrary to law and logic.”

So, what happens next in the case?

The context of [Xinis](https://www.mdd.uscourts.gov/paula-xinis-district-judge)’ order was her granting Abrego Garcia’s request for expedited “discovery,” referring to the process of gathering information in litigation. The judge said she’s pushing that process forward on a speedier-than-usual basis “to ascertain what, if anything” the [government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has done to (quoting the [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/)’s order) “facilitate Abrego Garcia’s release from custody in [El Salvador](https://www.gob.sv/) and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to [El Salvador](https://www.gob.sv/).”

The judge also said she’s considering whether to hold [government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) officials in contempt.  

The [discovery](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/discovery) process is set to play out in the coming days and includes depositions of officials, with additional briefing to follow later this month after the expedited discovery process is concluded.

That’s all to say that this crucial matter isn’t on course to be legally resolved in a matter of days. Whatever happens in the district court might ultimately have to be resolved by the [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) more definitively this time. Had the justices taken a stronger stance against the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) [last week](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-kilmar-abrego-garcia-deportation-supreme-court-rcna201104), Abrego Garcia might have been back by now.

Of course, the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) could likely moot the issue at any time with a diplomatic resolution, given its [close working relationship](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/nayib-bukele-white-house-kilmar-abrego-garcia-rcna201287) with the [Salvadoran government](https://www.gob.sv/) that’s detaining Abrego Garcia (and others without due process) in its terrorism prison.

At this point, it’s worth taking a step back from the legal minutiae of discovery, contempt and legal word games over what “facilitate” means to ask: What are we doing here?

The [government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has [admitted](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A949/354843/20250407103341248_Kristi%20Noem%20application.pdf) that it was an “error” to send Abrego Garcia to [El Salvador](https://www.gob.sv/). If it were to bring him back and then properly deport him after giving him due process, that would emphasize that this episode has been, at best, a waste of time. But the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s decision to dig in, rather than go through legal channels to achieve its goals, is what needlessly caused — and is needlessly prolonging — the sordid affair.
