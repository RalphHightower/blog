## [Judge Boasberg finds probable cause to hold Trump administration in contempt in deportation litigation](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/judge-boasberg-trump-criminal-contempt-deportation-rcna200064)

*[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) officials argued that a Supreme Court ruling overturning his orders in deportation case mooted the question of whether they violated them.*

[U.S. District](https://www.mdd.uscourts.gov/) [Judge James Boasberg](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/chief-judge-james-e-boasberg) said probable cause exists to find the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) in contempt for violating his order over deportation flights last month, explaining that he didn’t reach that conclusion lightly but that officials failed to provide satisfactory answers to explain their actions.

“The [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/) does not tolerate willful disobedience of judicial orders — especially by officials of a coordinate branch who have sworn an oath to uphold it,” [Boasberg](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/chief-judge-james-e-boasberg) wrote in a [lengthy opinion](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.278436/gov.uscourts.dcd.278436.81.0_2.pdf) Wednesday.

The judge said he would give the [government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) the chance to remedy its contempt but if it doesn’t, he’ll proceed to identify the people in contempt and refer the matter for prosecution.

> *Notably, contempt is unique in that judges can appoint lawyers to prosecute it if the [Justice Department] declines.*

Notably, contempt is unique in that judges [can appoint](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/nyc-mayor-eric-adams-special-counsel-judge-supreme-court-rcna194513?icid=latestpost_bot) lawyers to prosecute it if the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) declines, as one imagines could be the case if [Boasberg](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/chief-judge-james-e-boasberg) ultimately refers any [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) officials for contempt prosecutions to the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/). (Also notably and potentially relevant down the line, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-appointed [Supreme Court Justices](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) [Neil Gorsuch](https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/about.aspx) and [Brett Kavanaugh](https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/about.aspx) [have criticized](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/gorsuch-kavanaugh-prosecutorial-discretion-trump-rcna76803) this independent appointment authority in contempt prosecutions.)

[Boasberg](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/chief-judge-james-e-boasberg)’s ruling follows an April 3 hearing in Washington, D.C., [at which he pressed](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-[administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)/bad-faith-judges-rip-trump-[administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)-litigation-tactics-rcna199612) the [government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) about its compliance with his orders. Specifically, the [compliance litigation](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-boasberg-alien-enemies-act-deportations-rcna197253) centered on temporary restraining orders he issued March 15 to halt certain deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, [a rarely used law](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/judge-boasberg-trump-alien-enemies-act-argument-rcna198463) that [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) invoked to summarily deport alleged [Venezuelan](https://gob.ve/) gang members to [El Salvador](https://www.gob.sv/).

The 18th-century law had been invoked only three times before in the nation’s history, all during declared wars.

[Boasberg](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/chief-judge-james-e-boasberg)’s ruling comes as another judge warned of possible contempt proceedings in the [separate high-profile case](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/kilmar-abrego-garcia-facilitate-judge-paula-xinis-rcna201495) case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whom the [government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) also sent to [El Salvador](https://www.gob.sv/) without due process and is fighting against his return despite admitting he should not have been deported to that country.

In his opinion Wednesday, [Boasberg](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/chief-judge-james-e-boasberg) noted that courts typically let the party in contempt “purge” (or fix) their contempt by obeying the order they violated. He said the most obvious way for the [government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) to purge its contempt here would be “by asserting custody of the individuals who were removed in violation of the [Court](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/)’s classwide TRO [temporary restraining order] so that they might avail themselves of their right to challenge their removability through a habeas proceeding.” He added that the [government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) wouldn’t need to release any of those individuals or “transport them back to the homeland,” but he also said the [government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) can propose other compliance methods that he would consider.

“In the event that Defendants do not choose to purge their contempt, the [Court](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/) will proceed to identify the individual(s) responsible for the contumacious conduct by determining whose ‘specific act or omission’ caused the noncompliance,” the judge wrote in his opinion. He said he would begin by requiring declarations and that, if they’re unsatisfactory, he’ll proceed “either to hearings with live witness testimony under oath or to depositions conducted by Plaintiffs.”

The next step after that would be for the judge to request that the [government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) prosecute the contempt, with him being prepared to appoint another attorney if that doesn’t happen. The relevant [criminal procedural rule says](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/rule_42): “The court must request that the contempt be prosecuted by an attorney for the [government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), unless the interest of justice requires the appointment of another attorney. If the [government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) declines the request, the court must appoint another attorney to prosecute the contempt.”

[Boasberg](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/chief-judge-james-e-boasberg) [gave](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.278436/gov.uscourts.dcd.278436.80.0_2.pdf) the [government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) an April 23 deadline to either 1) file a declaration explaining the steps it has taken and will take to “purge” the contempt; or 2) if it chooses not to do so, to identify the people with knowledge of his order who chose “not to halt the transfer of class members out of U.S. custody on March 15 and 16.”

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) previously called for [Boasberg](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/chief-judge-james-e-boasberg)’s impeachment over his rulings, after which [Chief Justice](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) [John Roberts](https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/about.aspx) issued a rare public statement that impeachment “is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.” An [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) appointee, [Boasberg](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/chief-judge-james-e-boasberg) is the chief federal trial judge in the [District of Columbia](https://www.mdd.uscourts.gov/).

While contesting that they violated the judge’s orders, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) officials separately asked the [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) to overturn the orders. The court did so in a [divided ruling](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24a931_2c83.pdf) on April 7, after which [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) officials [argued to Boasberg](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.278436/gov.uscourts.dcd.278436.78.0.pdf) that the ruling nullified any potential contempt proceedings before him. Rejecting that argument in his opinion Wednesday, [Boasberg](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/chief-judge-james-e-boasberg) wrote that “the fact that the [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) determined that this [Court](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/)’s TROs suffered from a venue defect does not affect — let alone moot — the compliance inquiry presently teed up here.”
