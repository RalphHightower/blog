## [Amid turmoil, Trump heads to Florida for a golf event (again)](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-florida-golf-event-tariffs-soldiers-lithuania-rcna199706)

*After setting much of the global economy — and retirement accounts — on fire, taking a golf trip isn’t a great look for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).*

April 4, 2025, 10:42 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

It’s easy to imagine [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) feeling a sense of urgency and scheduling a busy day of difficult work. Major indices around the world have responded to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s trade tariffs with steep drop-offs. The [likelihood of a recession](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/live-blog/trump-reciprocal-tariffs-reactions-markets-consumers-live-updates-rcna199411/rcrd76206?canonicalCard=true). Key businesses have [announced layoffs](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/live-blog/trump-reciprocal-tariffs-reactions-markets-consumers-live-updates-rcna199411/rcrd76097?canonicalCard=true). Consumer prices are [poised to climb](https://politicalwire.com/2025/04/03/food-prices-could-soar-with-trump-tariffs/).

Key U.S. allies are [turning](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/live-blog/trump-reciprocal-tariffs-reactions-markets-consumers-live-updates-rcna199411/rcrd76112?canonicalCard=true) against [us](https://newrepublic.com/post/193581/canada-prime-minister-donald-trump-tariffs-economic-dominance), and U.S. rivals are [imposing retaliatory measures](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/business/china-trump-tariffs-retaliation.html). Even some of the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s most sycophantic partisan allies are [struggling](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/03/trump-tariffs-updates-reaction/#link-2INSRL7YRJFWRCI4IM5KVJXBQ4) to [defend](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/03/trump-tariffs-updates-reaction/#link-YOWDVLQV65DJLM3JO4PF4Q2MLA) the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s agenda.

In case this weren’t quite enough, four U.S. servicemen who died during a training exercise in [Lithuania](https://lrv.lt/) [poised to return home at a dignified transfer](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-tariffs-china-doge-musk-immigration-live-updates-rcna199420/rcrd76210?canonicalCard=true) at a dignified transfer at [Dover Air Force Base](https://www.dover.af.mil/), Delaware.

The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), however, hasn’t scheduled a busy day of work at the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), and he won’t be on hand for the service members’ return. As [The Washington Post reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/03/liv-golf-saudi-relationships-pull-trump-florida-markets-rage/), “A day after seeking to remake the global economic order, [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) on Thursday is returning to another priority: remaking professional golf.”

> *[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) will dine with leaders of the [LIV Golf](https://www.livgolf.com/) tour at his [Doral club](https://www.trumpgolfdoral.com/) outside [Miami](https://www.miami.gov/), his latest visit to [Florida](https://www.myflorida.com/) and a sporting event in a 73-day-old [presidency](https://www.whitehouse.gov%) that has already been full of both. The trip combines the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s prized relationship with the [Saudi Arabian](https://my.gov.sa/) leaders who own the tour; his regular visits to [Florida](https://www.myflorida.com/), where he has spent most weekends of this [presidency](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) at his [Mar-a-Lago resort](https://www.maralagoclub.com/); and his frequent mixing of personal business with his [presidential office](https://www.whitehouse.gov%).*

I think we’re all familiar with the old adage, “When the going gets tough, the ~~tough~~ weak[^11] get going to [Florida](https://www.myflorida.com/) for a [Saudi](https://my.gov.sa/)-backed golf event.”

[^11]: @RalphHightower: I struck through tough and used "weak" instead. 

Or something like that.

For a [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) who tends to be preoccupied with camera-ready appearances and the optics of politics, some part of him must realize that it doesn’t look great to take a golf trip after setting much of the global economy — and your retirement account — on fire, but [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s doing it anyway.

Making matters slightly worse, all of this comes on the heels of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s recent declaration that [federal employees](https://www.opm.gov/) who work remotely necessarily abuse the system. “I happen to be a believer that you have to go to work. I don’t think you can work from home,” the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [said in February](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/federal-workers-cast-trump-mar-lago-trips-working-home-rcna194641). “Nobody’s going to work from home. ... They’re going to play golf.”

Well, someone’s going to be playing golf instead of working, but I don’t think it’s the [federal workforce](https://www.opm.gov/).

Let’s also not forget that as a candidate in 2016, the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) seemed eager to give voters the impression that he’s a workaholic. At an event in [New Hampshire](https://www.nh.gov/), for example, while complaining about [Barack Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/)’s golf outings, [Trump declared](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-rolls-out-the-expletives-at-portsmouth-rally/) that if he were in office, “I’d want to stay in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and work my ass off.” Soon after, [he assured voters](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/19/us/trump-golf-florida.html?_r=0), “I’m going to be working for you. I’m not going to have time to go play golf.”

After taking office, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [proceeded to golf rather obsessively](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/dems-pounce-trump-returns-golfing-during-coronavirus-crisis-n1214676) throughout his [first term](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/). His [second term](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) is [offering more of the same](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-picks-wrong-fight-smears-federal-employees-dont-work-rcna196258).

When he spoke to [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/)’ [Kristen Welker](https://www.nbcnews.com/author/kristen-welker-ncpn6396) this past weekend and the topic of a third term came up, the [“Meet the Press”](https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press-full-episodes) host reminded him of just how much work a [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has to do.

“Well, I like working,” [Trump replied](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-third-term-white-house-methods-rcna198752).

Sure you do, big guy. Sure you do.
