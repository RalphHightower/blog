## Trump‚Äôs Tariffs ‚ÄúLiberates‚Äù \$6,000,000,000,000 In Value From World‚Äôs Stock Markets

### [Trump hits golf course as stock market plummets for second straight day over tariffs / AP News](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-tariffs-golf-813c7a300021445636f63fddbfd38c83)

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) ‚Äî Two days after sending the economy reeling by announcing widespread tariffs, [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) insisted his trade policies will never change as he remained ensconced in a bubble of wealth and power in Florida.

He woke up on Friday morning at [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/), [his private club in Palm Beach](https://www.maralagoclub.com/), and headed to his nearby golf course a few miles away.

The [Trumpian](https://www.gop.com/) president was not expected to appear publicly, although he‚Äôs scheduled to attend a candlelit dinner for [MAGA Inc.](https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-florida-donald-trump-campaigns-b3cca05169fa51ca5a996df61b3dfcbf), an allied political organization, on Friday evening. He spent Thursday in Miami at a different one of his golf courses, where he attended [a Saudi-funded tournament](https://apnews.com/article/trump-golf-liv-tour-pga-ab77d9aafb22c33e859fd6541b417836). He landed in Marine One and was picked up in a golf cart driven by his [son Eric](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erictrump/).

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com=) has often proved impervious to the kind of scandals or gaffes that would damage another politician, but his decision to spend the weekend at his gilded properties could test Americans‚Äô patience at a time when their retirement savings are evaporating [along with the stock market.](https://apnews.com/article/market-rates-trump-tariffs-d86db525c370e9da834e6dfb76e23b86). The tariffs are expected to increase prices by thousands of dollars per year and slow economic growth, and there are fears about [a potential recession](https://apnews.com/article/financial-markets-tariffs-trump-trade-cea98013c677e5b9bd6ce6166f4ce659).

‚ÄúWhile the American people are trying to put food on the table, I see that [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs out there playing golf,‚Äù said [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Ben Ray Luj√°n](https://www.booker.senate.gov/), a [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) from [New Mexico](https://www.newmexico.gov/). ‚ÄúThe president should be listening to people across the country. Maybe he should go into a grocery store, do some walking, talking to folks.‚Äù

[Federal Reserve Chair](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents.htm) [Jerome Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) said Friday that the tariffs were ‚Äúsignificantly larger than expected‚Äù and are [‚Äúhighly likely‚Äù](https://apnews.com/article/tariffs-inflation-economy-trump-powell-490417656971634592bbeb3b2ade3593) to cause more inflation ‚Äî at least in the short term but possibly in the long term as well.
