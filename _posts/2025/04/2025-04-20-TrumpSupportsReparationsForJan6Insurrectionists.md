## [Trump floats possibility of compensation for Jan. 6 rioters - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/25/trump-floats-possibility-of-compensation-for-jan-6-rioters-00250063)

[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) on Tuesday floated the possibility of financial compensation for people who were prosecuted for taking part in the riot at the [Capiol](https://www.congress.gov/) in 2021.

Speaking to Newsmax on Tuesday night, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said he had taken “care” of his supporters who attempted to overturn his [2020 election loss](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf) and added there is “talk” about compensating them.

“A lot of the people that are in the government now talk about it because a lot of the people in government really like that group of people,” he said, referring to the [Jan. 6 defendants](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith), who he described as protesting “peacefully and patriotically.”

Some of the freed [Jan. 6 rioters](https://www.govinfo.gov/committee/house-january6th?path=/browsecommittee/chamber/house/committee/january6th/collection/CRPT) and their advocates, such as Ed Martin, whom [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) appointed to be the top federal prosecutor in Washington, have long called for financial reparations for those who took part in the [Capiol](https://www.congress.gov/) [attack](https://www.webharvest.gov/congress117th/20221224173221/https://january6th.house.gov), many of whom subsequently spent time behind bars.

The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) also described himself as a “big fan” of Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed by a [Capitol police officer](https://www.uscp.gov/) as she attempted to climb through a shattered window into the Speaker’s Lobby.

“Ashli Babbitt was a really good person who was a big MAGA fan, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) fan. And she was innocently standing there, they even say trying to sort of hold back the crowd,” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said. “And a man did something to her that was unthinkable when he shot her.”

Asked whether he would take action against the officer who killed Babbitt and is still employed in Capitol law enforcement, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said he would “take a look at it.” [U.S. Capitol Police](https://www.uscp.gov/) Lt. Michael Byrd was investigated by the [Justice Department](https:www.justice.gov/) for the shooting and cleared of any wrongdoing.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s blanket pardon for his supporters fulfilled one of his key campaign pledges, though he had previously stopped short of promising monetary compensation. The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) signed an [order on his first day in office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/granting-pardons-and-commutation-of-sentences-for-certain-offenses-relating-to-the-events-at-or-near-the-united-states-capitol-on-january-6-2021/) [granting clemency to about 1,500](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/10/donald-trump-january-6-pardons-00222116) rioters who were prosecuted for taking part in the [Jan. 6, 2021](https://www.webharvest.gov/congress117th/20221231143403/january6report.house.gov/), attack on the [Capiol](https://www.congress.gov/), including hundreds convicted of assaulting police, carrying firearms and destroying property.

## [Donald Trump Discusses 'Compensation Fund' for Jan. 6 Rioters - Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-january-6-riot-compensation-2050582)

Published Mar 26, 2025 at 6:29 AM EDT<br />Updated Mar 26, 2025 at 9:13 PM EDT

[Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has voiced support for providing financial assistance to individuals convicted or charged in connection with the [January 6 Capitol riot](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edwa/pr/denouncing-violence-reporting-information-regarding-january-6-2020-attack-upon-us).

### Why It Matters

On the first day he took office in January, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [pardoned almost every individual convicted of crimes related to the deadly](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/granting-pardons-and-commutation-of-sentences-for-certain-offenses-relating-to-the-events-at-or-near-the-united-states-capitol-on-january-6-2021/) [January 6, 2021 riot](https://oig.justice.gov/news/doj-oig-releases-report-fbis-handling-its-confidential-human-sources-and-intelligence) at the [U.S. Capiol](https://www.congress.gov/) and commuted the sentences of the remaining 14. Some of those [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [pardoned or granted clemency to](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/granting-pardons-and-commutation-of-sentences-for-certain-offenses-relating-to-the-events-at-or-near-the-united-states-capitol-on-january-6-2021/) are facing [separate charges ranging from sexual abuse to domestic violence.](https://www.newsweek.com/january-six-rioter-pardoned-trump-arested-child-sex-charge-2027728).

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s [blanket pardon](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/granting-pardons-and-commutation-of-sentences-for-certain-offenses-relating-to-the-events-at-or-near-the-united-states-capitol-on-january-6-2021/) for the [January 6 rioters](https://oig.justice.gov/reports/review-federal-bureau-investigations-handling-its-confidential-human-sources-and) fulfilled a key campaign pledge, although he had previously not committed to offering monetary compensation.

The [January 6, 2021](https://www.justice.gov/sco-smith/media/1366521/dl) attack caused millions of dollars of damage at the [U.S. Capiol](https://www.congress.gov/) and about [140 police officers](https://www.uscp.gov/) were injured.

### What To Know

In an interview with [Newsmax](https://www.newsmax.com/) on Tuesday night, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) suggested that the [January 6 rioters](https://www.justice.gov/storage/US-v-Trump-Nauta-De-Oliveira-23-80101.pdf) he pardoned could get compensation payments.

During the interview, he referred to the [January 6 rioters](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) as "patriots" and claimed they were "treated very unfairly" by the government.

He added that those at the [Capiol](https://www.congress.gov/) were there "peacefully and patriotically" and said "a lot of the people that are in the government now talk about" compensating them "because a lot of the people in government really like that group of people."
[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) also paid tribute to [Air Force](https://www.af.mil/) veteran [Ashli Babbitt, who was fatally shot by a police officer](https://www.newsweek.com/exclusive-police-lieutenant-who-killed-january-6-capitol-rioter-ashli-babbitt-finally-identified-1623166) as she attempted to climb through a broken window into the Speaker's Lobby during the January 6, 2021 riot.

"Ashli Babbitt was a really good person who was a big MAGA fan, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) fan, and she was innocently standing there," he said. "And a man did something to her that was unthinkable when he shot her."

When [Newsmax](https://www.newsmax.com/)'s Greg Kelly asked whether he would take action against [Capitol Police](https://www.uscp.gov/) Lt. Michael Byrd, who was cleared of wrongdoing in Babbitt's shooting, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) replied, "I'm going to take a look at it."

Some of the freed [January 6 rioters](https://www.webharvest.gov/congress117th/20221231143403/january6report.house.gov/), attack on the [Capiol](https://www.congress.gov/) and their advocates have long called for financial reparations for those who took part in the [Capitol](https://www.congress.gov/) attack. But [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) had previously stopped short of supporting financial compensation as an option.

The [Justice Department](https://www.j/) and [Capiol](https://www.congress.gov/) administrators previously estimated that the costs of cleanup and repairs following the [January 6 riots](https://oig.justice.gov/reports/review-federal-bureau-investigations-handling-its-confidential-human-sources-and) totals nearly \$3 million. However, a February 2023 review by the [Government Accountability Office](https://www.gao.gov/) estimated actual costs of nearly $2.7 billion.

"This amount reflects, among other things, damage to the [Capitol building and grounds](https://www.congress.gov/), estimated costs borne by the [Capitol Police](https://www.uscp.gov/), the [District of Columbia](https://dc.gov/), and federal agencies, and estimated costs to address security needs and investigations as described in budget and funding requests, appropriations, agency estimates, and other publicly available information," the agency's report said.

[Federal judges](https://www.uscourts.gov/) had previously ordered hundreds of the defendants to make restitution to the federal government to offset the costs of the repairs at the [U.S. Capiol](https://www.congress.gov/), but only 15 percent was paid before [Trump issued blanket pardons](https://www.newsweek.com/full-list-january-6-prisoners-released-2018097) on January 20, hours after his inauguration.

As a result, taxpayers are now expected to be on the hook for most of the damage, cleanup and costs of the insurrection.

[Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) on the [U.S. House Oversight Committee](https://oversight.house.gov/) launched a review on Monday to determine how much of the millions of dollars in damages from the [January 6 riot](https://oig.justice.gov/reports/review-federal-bureau-investigations-handling-its-confidential-human-sources-and) remain unpaid by the rioters.

In a letter to [Architect of the Capiol](https://www.congress.gov/) Thomas Austin, [Representative](https://www.house.gov/) [Gerry Connolly (D-VA11)](https://connolly.house.gov/), the committee's top [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/), requested updated estimates on how much of the costs are being covered by federal taxpayers.

"Restitution was one of the most common sentences handed down to [January 6th insurrectionists](https://oig.justice.gov/reports/review-federal-bureau-investigations-handling-its-confidential-human-sources-and), but [offenders](https://oig.justice.gov/reports/review-federal-bureau-investigations-handling-its-confidential-human-sources-and) were slow to repay their obligations, and taxpayers were far from being made whole," [https://connolly.house.gov/) wrote. He also stressed that the official damage cost figures from the [Architect of the Capiol](https://www.congress.gov/) remain unknown and must be released.

### What People Are Saying

[Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said during a [Newsmax](https://www.newsmax.com/) interview: "A lot of people in government really like that group of people. They were patriots as far as I was concerned, I talk about them a lot. They were treated very unfairly, you know?"

### What Happens Next

It is still unclear if the [January 6 rioters](https://oig.justice.gov/reports/review-federal-bureau-investigations-handling-its-confidential-human-sources-and) will be provided with financial compensation. The president has not laid out any plan for this.
