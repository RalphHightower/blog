## [Musk lashes out at architect of Trump’s tariffs in first public comments about shock policy](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/musk-lashes-out-trump-tariffs-b2728143.html)

Story by Graig Graziosi. April 5, 2025.

There's trouble in [Trumplandia](https://www.maralagoclub.com/); [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) [CEO](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)
 and head of the [Department of Government Efficiency](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/layoff-numbers-doge-firings-b2726795.html), [Elon Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk), has taken public swipes at [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s adviser on trade and manufacturing, [Peter Navarro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-navarro-93167122/), who helped shape the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)'s reciprocal [tariff policy that tanked markets](https://www.independent.co.uk/business/trump-tariffs-us-stock-markets-shares-apple-b2727269.html) across the world.

[Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) is typically vocal in his support and defense of the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), but has been quiet since [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s "Liberation Day" tariff announcement that killed $2.5 trillion from the U.S. stock market — a loss of value that [cost the Tesla CEO](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/billionaires-stocks-markets-fall-trump-tariffs-b2727428.html) more than $30bn, according to [CNBC](http://go.redirectingat.com/?id=44681X1458326&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2025%2F04%2F05%2Ftrump-tariffs-zuckerberg-bezos-musk-lose-billions-on-market-meltdown.html&sref=/news/world/americas/us-politics/musk-lashes-out-trump-tariffs-b2728143.html).

On [X](https://X com/), which [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) owns, he took swipes at [Navarro], a [Harvard](https://www.harvard.edu/)-educated economist who advises [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) on trade. [Navarro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-navarro-93167122/) who was originally tapped for a spot in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) by [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is the author of books on [China](https://www.gov.cn/) and the economic threats he says the nation poses to the U.S.

A user on [X](https://X com/) posted a video from [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/) in which [Navarro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-navarro-93167122/) defends the tariffs, noting positively that he went to Harvard. [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) took issue with that, calling it a "bad thing."

"A PhD in Econ from [Harvard](https://www.harvard.edu/) is a bad thing, not a good thing," he wrote. "Results in the ego/brains>>1 problem."

Another user replied, insisting that [Navarro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-navarro-93167122/) was correct in his defense, but [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) rejected that and questioned [Navarro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-navarro-93167122/)'s practical economic experience.

"He aint bull shit," [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) wrote.

[Navarro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-navarro-93167122/) was jailed after a grand jury indicted him in 2022 on [two counts of contempt of Congress](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-news-today-advisor-arrested-jan-6-b2093934.html). He refused to comply with a subpoena from the White House Select Committee investigating the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021.

The economist was sentenced to [sentenced to four months in jail](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/navarro-sentencing-trump-aide-contempt-b2484926.html) and was fined \$9,500. He was the first former [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) official imprisoned on a charge of contempt of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/).

In another post, an [X](https://X com/) user shared a quote from conservative American economist [Thomas Sowell](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/thomas-sowell) that critiqued [Harvard](https://www.harvard.edu/)-trained professionals.

"In every disaster throughout American history, there always seems to be a man from Harvard in the middle of it," the quote, attributed to [Sowell](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/thomas-sowell), said.

[Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) replied to the post with a simple "yup."

[Sowell](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/thomas-sowell) has been a vocal critic of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s tariffs, and warned that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)'s policy could set off a global trade war and potentially another Great Depression, [according to Fox Business](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/legendary-economist-says-trumps-tariffs-could-replay-devastating-history).

Despite the shock and condemnation of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s tariffs [even by some conservatives](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/ben-shapiro-slams-trump-tariffs-video-b2728112.html), it hasn’t dulled the [negative attention](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-musk-hands-off-protests-b2728130.html) [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) is facing for his actions as the head of [DOGE](https://www.doge.gov/). Under [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk), the agency has demanded the [firing of tens of thousands of federal workers](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/social-security-doge-layoff-musk-b2727707.html), effectively [shuttered entire agencies](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/usaid-elon-musk-doge-lawyers-maryland-b2717509.html), and has [crippled some agencies'](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/doge-cuts-musk-weather-reports-b2708817.html) ability to work efficiently. Protesters took to the streets on Saturday to voice their anger at [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) for their dismantling of the [federal government](https://www.usa.gov/).

[Americans](https://www.usa.gov) frustrated by [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) — who was not personally elected — meddling in the federal government have responded by [protesting outside Tesla facilities](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/comment/elon-musk-tesla-protests-sales-slump-trump-b2725949.html) and boycotting the company's vehicles. Some have gone so far as to vandalize or even [destroy Tesla vehicles and showrooms](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/elon-musk-donald-trump-tesla-pam-bondi-seattle-b2717655.html).

[Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) announced a [13 percent drop in its first quarter sales](https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-first-quarter-2025-production-deliveries-and-deployments) this year when compared to last year, making it the company's worst quarter since 2022, according to a company statement. As of Friday, [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)'s stock price was down 10 percent between [Musk-related blowback](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/tesla-share-price-stock-elon-musk-donald-trump-b2721279.html) and [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s tariffs.

[Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)'s comments come shortly after news broke that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) told his inner circle that the [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) [CEO](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) will be [stepping back from his duties](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-musk-role-doge-end-b2725182.html) at the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), although he has not given a timeline for this happening.
