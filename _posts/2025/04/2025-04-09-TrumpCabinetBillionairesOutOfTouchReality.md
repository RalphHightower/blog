## [Tariffs expose how out of touch Trump’s Cabinet is with everyday Americans](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-out-of-touch-tariffs-billionaires-retirement-rcna200218)

*[Scott Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent), the former hedge fund manager turned [treasury secretary](https://home.treasury.gov/), made it clear how disconnected he is from the reality of ordinary Americans.*

By Stephanie Ruhle

This is an adapted excerpt from the [April 7](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house) episode of “Deadline: White House.”

On Sunday, [Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/treasury-secretary-interview-offers-timely-reminder-are-no-adults-room-rcna199959) tried to dismiss the concerns of millions of Americans worried about the impact of [President Donald Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/donald-trump)’s sweeping tariffs, telling [telling NBC News’ Kristen Welker](https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/treasury-sec-bessent-says-there-doesn-t-have-to-be-a-recession-full-interview-236654149913) it’s a “false narrative” that people who are close to retiring may now be hesitant to do so because of recent economic turmoil.

“Americans who want to retire right now, the Americans who put away for years in their savings accounts, I think they don’t look at the day-to-day fluctuations,” [Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) said.

While the markets were melting down over his tariffs, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wasn’t in Washington trying to calm the fears of the American people. He was golfing.

With that statement, [Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent), a former hedge fund manager with assets and investments [apparently worth more than \$700 million](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/11/business/scott-bessent-treasury-divest.html), made it quite clear just how disconnected he is from the reality of ordinary Americans, 58% of whom [hold stocks](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/scf23.pdf), including half the private sector workforce [saving for retirement through 401(k) investment accounts](https://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/retirement/retirement-benefits-401k-workers-4e02f92f).

When [Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) accepted the job of [treasury secretary](https://home.treasury.gov/), he sold his home in [Charleston](https://charleston-sc.gov/), [South Carolina](https://www.sc.gov/), [for almost \$22 million](https://www.postandcourier.com/business/trump-charleston-scott-bessent-sc-real-estate-home-sales-treasury/article_c481a072-f623-11ef-80fa-b383637046cf.html) — a record price for any home on the [Charleston](https://charleston-sc.gov/) peninsula. So it’s easy to see how he, much like [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s other ultra-wealthy [Cabinet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/) official, [Howard Lutnick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/howardwlutnick/) — who [made headlines just a few weeks ago](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/21/social-security-lutnick-doge-checks) when he said his mother-in-law “wouldn’t call and complain” if she missed a [Social Security](https://www.ssa.gov/) check — don’t share the same concerns as a majority of the American people.

For anyone who wants to try to dismiss these concerns and say, “Well, the markets are not the economy,” you’re right about that. They’re not. But look at [what we’re hearing](https://fortune.com/2025/04/05/trump-tariffs-us-recession-outlook-gdp-unemployment-stagflation-inflation-fed/) from major financial institutions; [what they’re predicting right now is a recession](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/goldman-sachs-raises-odds-us-recession-45-2025-04-07/). That’s not just the market. A recession will impact almost every element of daily life.

But it’s not just members of [Trump)(https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Cabinet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/) who are out of touch — this starts at the top. While the markets were melting down over his tariffs, Trump wasn’t in Washington trying to calm the fears of the American people. Instead, he was [golfing and attending fundraisers](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-florida-golf-event-tariffs-soldiers-lithuania-rcna199706) at his [Mar-a-Lago estate](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) in [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/).

On Saturday, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) took time away from his busy weekend to tell Americans that “THIS IS AN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, AND WE WILL WIN,” and urged them to “HANG TOUGH” in a post [on his Truth Social platform](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114285375813275308).

This is the consequence of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s “big business” administration. When he retook the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), the [president](https:www.whitehouse.gov/) said he had a mandate from the American people to run this country like a [business](https://www.trump.com/)[^41]. Well, here you have it. He’s doing just that. The government is now in the hands of these hugely wealthy guys in these hugely important jobs, who are so far out of touch with where the American people are.
