## [Surprising sales news sends Tesla stock tumbling](https://www.thestreet.com/automotive/surprising-sales-news-sends-tesla-stock-tumbling)

Story by Todd Campbell • April 16, 2025

[Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)'s mercurial CEO, [Elon Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk), has drawn praise and criticism for his unpredictable nature, which has caused [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)'s stock price to pop and drop several times over the past decade.

[Elon Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)'s supporters applaud his single-handedly launching the electric vehicle era, while his foes point to failed model launches and autonomous vehicle timelines.

The debate has intensified this year after [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) spent hundreds of millions of dollars supporting [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s election last year, and in the wake of his spearheading the [Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)](https://www.doge.gov), an organization in the executive branch tasked with cutting costs.

[Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)'s political moves appear to frustrate many [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) buyers, as sales in key markets have recently declined. 

The trend doesn't appear to be slowing, given disappointing sales data from California, which contributed to [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)'s stock price dropping 5% on April 16.

[Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)'s advantage is slipping
[Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)'s  (TSLA)  success stems from [Elon Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) focusing on the performance of its electric vehicles. Instead of making them solely environmentally friendly, [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) built high-performance luxury cars to compete against Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Porsche.

[Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)'s performance-first strategy turned [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)s into aspirational vehicles desired by celebrities and speed enthusiasts, leaving competitors like Ford and General Motors in the lurch.

[Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)'s luxury EV moat, however, has significantly eroded. 

Most car companies worldwide, including Detroit's Big Three, have developed high-end EVs, and many of them deliver similar performance and possibly better fit-and-finish than [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/).

The launch of so many rivals has damaged [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)'s electric vehicle market share, and [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)'s often polarizing political positions aren't helping it shore up key markets overseas.

According to the [China](https://www.cn.gov/) Passenger Car Association, [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)'s sales in [China](https://www.cn.gov/) fell 21.8% in Q1, and in Germany, sales fell 62%, according to KBA.

[Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) gets disappointing [California](https://www.ca.gov/) news
It's also been a struggle in the United States, given [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)'s sales volume fell 9% from year-ago levels in Q1, according to [Cox Automotive](https://www.coxautoinc.com/)/[KBB](https://www.kbb.com/). Electric vehicle sales were up 11% across all brands in the quarter.

[Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)'s lackluster first-quarter figures follow a 1% dip in U.S. sales in 2024, the first annual drop in more than a decade, and a 2.3% decline in the fourth quarter, despite total EV sales climbing 15%, according to the Cox/KBB.

Meanwhile, [Ford](https://www.ford.com/) and [General Motors](https://www.gm.com/)' EV sales have surged. In Q1, [Ford](https://www.ford.com/) saw its EV sales climb 11.5%. [GM](https://www.gm.com)'s [Cadillac](https://www.cadillac.com/), [GMC](https://www.gmc.com/), and [Chevrolet](https://www.chevrolet.com/) saw EV sales increase by 37%, 184%, and 114%.

[Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)'s fortunes aren't improving, at least not yet.

In [California](https://www.ca.gov/), which historically has accounted for about one-third of U.S. EV sales, [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) registrations slumped 15% year-over-year. Non-[Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) zero-emission vehicle registrations rose 35%, according to [California's New Car Dealers Association (CNCDA)](https://www.cncda.org/)

It was [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)'s sixth straight quarterly decline in the state. According to [Experian](https://www.experian.com/) Automotive data, total [California](https://www.ca.gov/) EV registrations rose 8%.

As a result, while [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) remains the biggest EV company in [California](https://www.ca.gov/), its market share fell to 43.9% from 55.5% last year.

"An aging product lineup and backlash against [Elon Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)’s political initiatives are likely key factors for the decline in [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) BEV market share," wrote the [CNCDA](https://www.cncda.org/).
