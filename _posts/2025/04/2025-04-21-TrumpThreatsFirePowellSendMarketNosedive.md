- [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) ratcheted up his pressure campaign on [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) [Chairman Jerome Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm).
- [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) on Truth Social called [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) a “major loser” and warned that the U.S. economy could slow down unless interest rates fall immediately.
- [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his team are studying whether they can legally fire the central bank leader before his term is set to expire.

[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) on Monday ratcheted up his pressure campaign on [Federal Reserve](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/18/trump-renews-call-for-powell-to-lower-interest-rates-he-should-bring-them-down.html) [Chairman Jerome Powell](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/17/markets-will-crash-if-trump-can-fire-feds-powell-elizabeth-warren-warns.html), calling him a “major loser” and warning that the [U.S. economy](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/20/stock-market-today-live-updates.html) could slow down unless interest rates are lowered immediately.

″‘Preemptive Cuts’ in Interest Rates are being called for by many,” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wrote on [Truth Social](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)/posts/114376239725335883).

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) claimed that there is currently “virtually No Inflation” in the U.S., and that costs for energy and “most other ‘things’” are on the decline.

“With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW,” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wrote.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s latest salvo against [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) — whom he appointed during his [first administration](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/) — came as the president and his team are studying whether they can legally fire the central bank leader before his term expires in May 2026.

[Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) has flatly stated that the president cannot remove him under the law.

Any attempt by [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to fire [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) would likely trigger a steep sell off in U.S. equity markets, Evercore ISI Vice President [Krishna Guha](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/21/expect-a-severe-market-reaction-if-trump-tries-to-fire-powell-says-evercore-isis-krishna-guha.html) told [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/) on Monday.

“If you start to raise questions about [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) independence, you are raising the bar for the  [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) to cut. If you actually did try to remove the  [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) chairman, I think you would see a severe reaction in markets with yields higher, dollars lower and equities selling off,” Guha said on “[Squawk Box](https://www.cnbc.com/squawk-box-us/).”

“I can’t believe that that’s what the administration is trying to achieve,” Guha said.

The stock market, already reeling from heightened uncertainty and other concerns stemming from the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s sweeping tariff plans, sank further Monday morning. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 750 points, a nearly 2% drop, within the first hour of trading, while the Nasdaq fell 2.6%.

The U.S. dollar, meanwhile, fell to its lowest level since 2022. The churn in global markets has sent investors flocking to safe-haven assets such as gold, which hit a record high price on Monday, while the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield crept up.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s latest attacks on [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) followed the central bank leader’s suggestion last week that the president’s trade war will constrain growth and could fuel inflation.

Tariffs are “likely to move us further away from our goals ... probably for the balance of this year,” [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) said at the [Economic Club of Chicago](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20250416a.htm).

[Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) also stopped short of suggesting that interest rate cuts were on the horizon.

“For the time being, we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,” he said.
