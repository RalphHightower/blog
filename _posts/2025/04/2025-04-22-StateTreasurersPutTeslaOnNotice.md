## [Tesla Board Gets an Earful From State Treasurers Over Musk’s Focus](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-22/tesla-board-gets-an-earful-from-state-treasurers-over-musk-s-focus)

Story by Dana Hull • April 22, 2025

(Bloomberg) -- The treasurers of eight US states have written an [open letter](https://www.a4rg.org/our-voice/2025-04-17-letter-to-tesla-board-chair) to [Tesla Inc.](https://www.tesla.com/)’s [board of directors](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate) questioning the direction of the [company](https://www.tesla.com/) and the level of attention [Elon Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) is paying to its mounting challenges.

The overseers of funds and investments for [California](https://www.ca.gov/), [Illinois](https://www.illinois.gov/) and half a dozen other states cite [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)’s [sagging stock](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-07/tesla-tsla-shares-fall-below-price-lutnick-said-it-wouldn-t-drop-to-again), [disappointing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-02/tesla-sales-slump-to-lowest-since-2022-amid-anti-musk-backlash) first-quarter deliveries and [surge of trade-ins](https://insideevs.com/news/756848/tesla-trade-in-250-percent/) by vehicle owners as being among their causes for concern.

“Meanwhile, CEO[^96] [Elon Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) continues to divide his attention across multiple companies and a high-profile advisory role within the federal government,” the treasurers wrote. “These external commitments raise serious questions about whether [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)’s [leadership](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate) is fully engaged in addressing the [company](https://www.tesla.com/)’s core challenges.”

The letter — pulled together in coordination with the advocacy group [Americans for Responsible Growth](https://www.a4rg.org/) — heaps more pressure on [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) and [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) ahead of the [company](https://www.tesla.com/) releasing first-quarter earnings results after the close Tuesday.

The [carmaker](https://www.tesla.com/)’s stock has plunged more than 50% from an all-time high reached in mid-December, when investors initially viewed [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)’s proximity to then [President-elect](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) as a positive. The role the [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) CEO[^96] has played in advising the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has instead sparked a [global backlash](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-02-26/tesla-sales-plunge-as-anti-elon-musk-backlash-takes-hold) against [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) and his most valuable [company](https://www.tesla.com/).

[California](https://www.ca.gov/)’s [Malia Cohen](https://www.sco.ca.gov/eo_about_bio.html), [Illinois](https://www.illinois.gov/)’ [Michael Frerichs](https://www.illinoistreasurer.gov/Office_of_the_Treasurer/Treasurer_Frerichs) and the six other treasurers warn that if [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) continues to falter, it “will ripple through regional economies” and shake public confidence in the energy transition.

Although [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) moved [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)’s [headquarters](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/) to [Austin](https://www.austintexas.gov/government) from Silicon Valley in 2021, [California](https://www.ca.gov/) is still home to several of the [company](https://www.tesla.com/)’s [manufacturing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-11/tesla-boosts-pay-for-us-factory-workers-as-uaw-momentum-builds) and [engineering](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-22/tesla-names-engineering-headquarters-in-event-with-musk-newsom) facilities. Several of the states whose treasurers signed the letter — including [Washington](https://www.wa.gov/), [Massachusetts](https://www.mass.gov/), [Colorado](https://www.colorado.gov/) and [Connecticut](https://www.ct.gov/) — have adopted [California](https://www.ca.gov/)’s standards aimed at boosting sales of electric vehicles.

In the letter addressed to [Robyn Denholm](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/robyn-m-denholm
), [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)’s chair, the treasurers ask the board to clarify how it’s ensuring that [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) and his leadership team are “devoting adequate time and focus to resolving recent performance issues.” The state officials also prod [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) directors about their approach to [executive compensation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-11/tesla-tells-delaware-court-why-musk-deserves-record-pay-package) and how they plan to restore investor confidence.

“The [board](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate)’s role is especially critical now — to provide strong oversight, uphold fiduciary standards and ensure that the [company](https://www.tesla.com/)’s [leadership](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate) is aligned with the long-term best interests of the [company](https://www.tesla.com/),” the treasurers wrote. “Public officials like us do not take the step of raising these concerns lightly except when the obvious risks demand it.”

## 2025-04-17 Letter to [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) Board Chair


April 17, 2025

[Robyn Denholm](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/robyn-m-denholm)
Chair of the Board
[Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)
1 [Tesla, Inc.](https://www.tesla.com/) Road
[Austin](https://www.austintexas.gov/government), [TX](https://www.texas.gov/) 78725

Dear Chair [Denholm](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/robyn-m-denholm),

We are entrusted with promoting the long-term economic health and financial stability of our states and the people we serve. [Tesla, Inc.](https://www.tesla.com/) is not just one of the world’s most valuable companies—it is a major player in the clean energy economy and a leading force in emerging technologies such as robotics and autonomous driving. The [company](https://www.tesla.com/)’s success or setbacks have significant implications for workers, regional industries, and innovation ecosystems in our states.

We are increasingly concerned that [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)’s recent performance signals deeper governance and leadership challenges that, if left unaddressed, could have serious consequences for the [company](https://www.tesla.com/) and its stakeholders. In the first quarter of 2025 alone, [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)’s stock declined by 36%. The [company](https://www.tesla.com/) missed delivery targets, recalled a substantial number of vehicles, and experienced a surge in trade-ins for competing brands. Meanwhile, CEO[^96] [Elon Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) continues to divide his attention across multiple companies and a high-profile advisory role within the [federal government](https://www.usa.gov/). These external commitments raise serious questions about whether [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)’s leadership is fully engaged in addressing the [company](https://www.tesla.com/)’s core challenges.

We regularly interact with stakeholders across our states, including institutional investors, industry leaders, workers, and small businesses. We are hearing increasing concern about [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)’s direction, not only from financial professionals but from those who have looked to [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) as a leader in clean energy innovation and American industrial renewal. If [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) falters, the effects won’t be confined to shareholders—they will ripple through regional economies, workforce pipelines, and public confidence in the energy transition.

At a moment when American industrial leadership is facing stiff global competition, it is essential that companies like [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) are governed with focus, discipline, and clarity of mission. The [Board](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate)’s role is especially critical now—to provide strong oversight, uphold fiduciary standards, and ensure that the [company](https://www.tesla.com/)’s [leadership](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate) is aligned with the long-term best interests of the [company](https://www.tesla.com/). Public officials like us do not take the step of raising these concerns lightly except when the obvious risks demand it.

We believe the [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) [Board](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate) has a responsibility to act decisively to ensure the [company](https://www.tesla.com/) returns to a stable and focused trajectory.

We respectfully request the [Board](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate) provide clarity on the following:

1. How is the [Board](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate) ensuring that [Mr. Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) and [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)’s leadership team are devoting adequate time and focus to resolving recent performance issues and guiding the [company](,https://www.tesla.com/)’s future direction?
2. In light of the [company](,https://www.tesla.com/)’s underperformance, how is the [Board](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate) evaluating whether executive compensation remains aligned with shareholder value and corporate accountability?
3. How does the [Board](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate) plan to communicate its strategy for navigating this period of uncertainty and restoring investor and public confidence in [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)’s leadership?

Finally, we strongly believe [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)’s [Board](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate) would benefit from engaging with public sector stakeholders who share an interest in the [company](,https://www.tesla.com/)’s long-term value and societal impact. We welcome the opportunity to speak further about these concerns and discuss how the [Board](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate) can take swift and transparent action to restore investor confidence and public trust in [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)’s leadership and the [company](,https://www.tesla.com/)’s future.

We welcome a response and the opportunity for continued dialogue.


Signed,
