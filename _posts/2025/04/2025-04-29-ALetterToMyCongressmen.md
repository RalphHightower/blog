[Congressman](https://www.congress.gov/) [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Joe Wilson](https://joewilson.house.gov/) | [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Lindsey Graham](https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/) | [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Tim Scott](https://www.scott.senate.gov/):

Elections have consequences, and the choices we make today will shape the future of our democracy.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has ir‚Äãrep‚Äãa‚Äãra‚Äãbly damaged the United States reputation on the world's stage.

As [[Trumpian legislators](https://www.gop.com/) are the majority in the red state of [South Carolina](https://www.sc.gov/), your elected seat is safe. However, there are other voters in the [United States](,https://www.usa.gov/) who can flip the majority in the [House](https://www.house.gov/) and [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) to [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/).

This oath is not just ceremonial; it is a solemn promise to uphold the principles that define our nation.

‚ÄúI do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/) of the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter: So help me God.‚Äù

I urge you to summon the courage to stand against [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and uphold and defend the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/) as you swore when you took the oath of office.

Our nation is under attack from the president. The [Trumpians](https://www.gop.com/) in [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) have abdicated their responsibility to protect and defend the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/). They have capitulated in fear of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). 

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is making enemies of our neighbors and allies; while [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is making friends of our enemies. 

Our allies recognize that the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) is erratic, unstable, and untrustworthy. 

The other four major English speaking countries, [Canada](https://www.canada.ca/), [United Kingdom](https://www.gov.uk/), [Australia](https://www.gov.au/), and [New Zealand](https://www.govt.nz/), are considering withholding intelligence information sharing with the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/). With the [US](https://www.usa.gov/), that intelligence group was known as the "Five Eyes."

The following news occurred in the past two months:

### **Ignoring the First Amendment Protecting Freedom of Speech and the Press**:

Banning the [Associated Press](https://www.apnews.com/) from White House press briefings and the press pool because the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) won't recognize "The Gulf of America" is an attack on the [First Amendment]().
 
The [AP Stylebook](https://www.ap.org/solutions/platforms/ap-stylebook/) specifies using internationally recognized names, as such, the Gulf of Mexico will continue to be used.

However, since Mount Denali is within America's borders, it will now be recognized as Mount McKinley per [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s Executive Orders and the chagrin of Alaskans.

- **Banning Law Firms From Federal Buildings, Contracts, Revoking Security Clearances**:

Imagine if a [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) president, [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/), [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/), or a future president, banned your law practice from practicing in federal courts and banned the firm's employees from entering federal buildings.

According to their respective [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/) pages, [Wilson](https://joewilson.house.gov/), [Fry](https://fry.house.gov/), [Timmons](https://timmons.house.gov/), and [Graham](https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/) are lawyers representing [South Carolina](https://www.sc.gov/) in the [House](https://www.house.gov/) and [Senate](,https://www.senate.gov/). Imagine if a [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) president banned them and their firm from Federal buildings. They wouldn't be able to represent clients in [Federal Court](https://www.uscourts.gov/), or even enter a [Post Office](https://www.usps.com/). 

- **Weaponizing Federal Government**:

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is using the presidency to attack his perceived political enemies. 

Calling for the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) to persecute [Christopher Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/) and [Miles Taylor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miles-taylor-65707671/). While [Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/) led the [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)](https://www.cisa.gov/), he affirmed that the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf) was the most secure. 

[Miles Taylor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miles-taylor-65707671/) worked in the [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/). [Taylor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miles-taylor-65707671/) contributed to expanding [U.S.](,https://www.usa.gov/) protections against weaponized drones, and led sensitive counterterrorism activities at [DHS](https://www.dhs.gov, /), including work to disrupt terrorist plots that spanned multiple cells, multiple countries, and multiple attack vectors.

My use of the word persecute is intentional. 

[Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/) offers guidance on when to use prosecute instead of persecute: ‚ÄúOne, you do in court; the other you do if you‚Äôre a jerk.‚Äù

- **Ignoring Court Rulings**:

One court case received a unanimous 9-0 [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) in favor of returning Abrego Garcia to the US. Another judge is considering holding the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) in Contempt of [Court](https://www.uscourts.gov/). This deportation of illegal aliens in the dead of night to El Salvador's gulag, CECOT prison, violates the [Fifth](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-5/) and [Sixth Amendments](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-6/). 

Every person is due process of law. We are a nation of laws, not ruled by a king.

- **[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs Capricious Leadership & On Again, Off Again Tariffs** 

Because of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs whipsaw actions, [Canada](https://www.canada.ca/) is considering canceling their 19 billion dollar order of [Lockheed Martin](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/) [F-35 fighter jets](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/) [F-35](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/products/f-35.html) and buying from [Europe](https://commission.europa.eu/). [Portugal](https://www.portugal.gov.pt/pt/gc24) is canceling their order.

The [European Union](https://commission.europa.eu/) looks to strengthen trading partnerships with [China](https://www.gov.cn/) and reduce trade with the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/).

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs "Liberation Day" tanked the world‚Äôs stock markets. Nations and investors switched from the turbulent stock markets to the safe harbor of bonds. But [US Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/) bonds were being sold and switched to [European](https://commission.europa.eu/) bonds. [Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/) [secretary Scott Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) recognized that the bond market wasn't behaving as expected and asked [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to back off.

I don't have a subscription to [MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/), but the headline of one article was clear. The [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) economy is now considered an emerging market. Ouch!

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is not the brilliant businessman that he claims that he is. He has lost two casinos, and an airline, besides bankrupting his family-owned business six times.

- **Attacking Universities**:

The [Civil Rights Act of 1964](https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/civil-rights-act) was intended to prohibit the discrimination of blacks. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) cannot strike law or create law with the issuance of executive orders. 

Only [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) has the pwer to create legislation for the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) to sign into law. 

The courts have the power to strike laws or refine laws. 

Threatening to have the [IRS](https://www.irs.gov/) revoke Harvard's tax exempt status is [Nixon-esque](https://www.nixonlibrary.gov/). Just because [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) doesn't like it's policies or courses is outside of the powers of a [presidency](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).

- **Signalgate**:

If the sharing of wars plans on their unsecured personal cellphones had happened with a Democratic president, Trumpian legislators, [Trumpers](https://www.gop.com/) would have been ap‚Äão‚Äãplec‚Äãtic, demanding firings. With a journalist, no less, in the group chat. The reaction from [Trumpers](https://www.gop.com/) was, "Meh." This breach of protocol undermines the integrity of our military operations and puts American lives at risk.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù policy has left ‚ÄúAmerica Alone‚Äù and isolated.

Illustrating America's new isolation from a neighbor and former ally, is an excerpt from [Canadian](https://www.canada.ca/) [Prime Minister Mark Carney](https://www.pm.gc.ca/)‚Äôs victory speech:

*"Our old relationship with the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/), a relationship based on steadily increasing integration, is over. The system of open global trade anchored by the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/), a system that [Canada](https://www.canada.ca/) has relied on since the Second World War, a system that well not perfect has helped deliver prosperity for a country for decades, is over.*

*"But it‚Äôs also our new reality.*

*"We are over the shock of the American betrayal, but we should never forget the lessons. We have to look out for ourselves and above all we have to take care of each other."*

---

This speech underscores the consequences of isolationist policies and the erosion of trust in American leadership.

Freedom from Consequences is not a protected [Constitutional](https://constitution.congress.gov/) Right.
