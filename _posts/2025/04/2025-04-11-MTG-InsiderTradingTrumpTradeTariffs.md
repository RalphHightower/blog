### [MTG scooped up plummeting stocks during market chaos sparked by Trump tariffs](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-stocks-market-chaos-b2731742.html)
Story by Mike Bedigan. April 11, 2025
[Republican](https://www.gop.com/) firebrand and [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) acolyte [Marjorie Taylor Greene (T-GA14)](https://greene.house.gov/) scooped up a number of plummeting [stocks](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/stocks) following the [market chaos caused by the president’s global tariffs](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-supreme-court-china-tariffs-live-updates-b2731496.html).

The [The Georgia congresswoman](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-signal-leak-interview-b2722433.html), an avid supporter of the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)'s trade policies, not only bought stocks last week, but also took on some of the biggest losers when markets tumbled over [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s tariff war.

On [Wednesday morning, the president posted](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/batya-ungar-sargon-obama-bush-b2731721.html) on his social media site truth Social: “NOW IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!”

[Greene](https://greene.house.gov/), it appears, listened to the advice.

The [congresswoman bought stock in big brands](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/congresswoman) like [Lululemon](https://www.lululemon.com/), [Dell Computer](https://www.dell.com/ ), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/), and the parent of [Restoration Hardware](https://rh.com/) after they dropped by around 40 percent on average late last week.

Data from a required three-page financial holdings document, seen by [The Associated Press](https://www.apnews.com/), doesn't disclose exactly how much she paid for the stocks, only ranges and dates. As of Wednesday’s market close, some of her investments were already beginning to pay off.

[RH](https://rh.com/), formerly called [Restoration Hardware](https://rh.com/), jumped more than a third since Friday's close when she bought it after a collapse in price that even shook the head of the furniture retailer, [CEO Gary Friedman](https://ir.rh.com/corporate-governance/leadership), who responded “oh shit” during a company call when the tariffs were announced.

[Dell](https://www.dell.com/) has jumped 9 percent since [Greene](https://greene.house.gov/) bought the stock last week after it had lost more than half its value.

Lawmakers from both major parties have previously proposed bills banning members from stock trading because of the apparent [conflict of interest](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/conflict-of-interest) in owning shares of companies they can heavily influence with positions they can take in office.

Asked whether she made the stock purchases herself and about possible conflicts of interest, [Greene](https://greene.house.gov/) said in a statement to [AP](https://www.apnews.com/): “I have signed a fiduciary agreement to allow my financial advisor to control my investments. All of my investments are reported with full transparency.”

[Greene](https://greene.house.gov/) is one of the MAGA faithfuls that have been outspoken in her support of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s tariffs. “Tariffs are a powerful proven source of leverage to protect our national interests,” she posted on [X](https://x.com/) previously, adding, “We will win this trade war.”

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s sudden and surprising pause to the tariff’s announced on Wednesday has led some [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) to question whether market manipulation or [insider trading](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/insider-trading) has occurred.

NEW YORK (AP) — As stocks tanked on tariff fears, [Marjorie Taylor Greene (T-GA14)](https://greene.house.gov/) showed her faith in the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) not just with words but dollar bills.

The [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [congresswoman](https://www.congress.gov/), an avid supporter of the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s trade policies, not only bought stocks last week as others dumped them in a panic — she scooped up some of the biggest losers.

[Lululemon](https://www.lululemon.com/), [Dell Computer](https://www.dell.com/), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/), the parent of [Restoration Hardware](https://rh.com/) and a few others hit hard by [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s tariff threats were down 40% on average late last week when she pounced.

Data from a required three-page financial holdings document doesn’t disclose exactly how much she paid for the stocks, only ranges and dates.

But however much she spent, some of her bets are working out so far, at least as of Wednesday’s close.

[RH](https://rh.com/), formerly called [Restoration Hardware](https://rh.com/), is [Greene](https://greene.house.gov/)’s clear winner. It jumped more than a third since since Friday’s close when she bought it after a stunning collapse in price that shook even the head of the furniture retailer.

“Oh, shit!,” said [RH](https://rh.com/) [CEO Gary Friedman](https://ir.rh.com/corporate-governance/leadership) in a conference call last week as the stock plunged.

[Dell](https://www.dell.com/) has jumped 9% since [Greene](https://greene.house.gov/) bought the stock last week after it had lost more than half its value.

Lawmakers from both major parties have proposed bills banning members from stock trading because of the apparent conflict of interest in owning shares of companies they can heavily influence with positions they can take in office.

But none of the clunkily named bills -- The [Transparent Representation Upholding Service and Trust in Congress Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/345), for instance -- has been passed. A new bill, [The End Congressional Stock Trading Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1908), was proposed last month.

Asked whether she made the stock purchases herself and about possible conflicts of interest, [Greene](https://greene.house.gov/) said in a statement: “I have signed a fiduciary agreement to allow my financial advisor to control my investments. All of my investments are reported with full transparency.”

[The MAGA supporter has been outspoken in her support of Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s tariffs.

“Tariffs are a powerful proven source of leverage to protect our national interests,” she posted on [X](https://x.com/) earlier this year, adding “We will win this trade war.”

Investors are not completely convinced.

After surging on Wednesday when [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) called a partial halt to the import taxes, stocks were heading down again Thursday.
