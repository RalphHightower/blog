## [Tesla falls again after J.P. Morgan points to 'unprecedented' brand damage](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4428713-tesla-falls-again-after-jp-morgan-points-to-unprecedented-brand-damage?feed_item_type=news&fr=1)

[Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) (NASDAQ:[TSLA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA?feed_item_type=news&fr=1&)) swung lower in early trading on Friday after [J.P. Morgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/global) slashed estimates on the electric vehicle maker, saying the trend in sales is worse than it appreciated and confirmed "unprecedented" brand damage.

The firm now expects Q1 EPS of $0.36 in comparison to its prior estimate of $0.40 prior and the consensus estimate of $0.45. The full year 2025 EPS estimate was reduced to $2.30 vs. $2.35 prior and $2.61 consensus. "Our earnings estimates are predicated in part on a lower outlook for deliveries (404K in 2Q25, down from 418K prior; 1,715K in FY25, down from 1,775K prior; and 1,975K in FY26, down from 2,025K prior)," highlighted analyst Ryan Brinkman. 

[J.P. Morgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/global) kept an Underweight rating on [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) (NASDAQ:[TSLA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA?feed_item_type=news&fr=1&)) in place. Brinkman and his team see significant downside to the firm's December 2025 price target of $120.

In terms of market cap, [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) [(TSLA)](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA?feed_item_type=news&fr=1&) is still valued by the market at more than [Toyota](https://www.toyota.com/) ([TM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TM?feed_item_type=news&fr=1&)), [Ferrari](https://www.ferrari.com/) ([RACE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RACE?feed_item_type=news&fr=1&)), [General Motors](https://www gm.com/) ([GM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GM?feed_item_type=news&fr=1&)), [Honda](https://www.honda.com/) ([HMC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HMC?feed_item_type=news&fr=1&)), [Stellantis]() ([STLA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/STLA?feed_item_type=news&fr=1&)), and [Ford Motor](https://www.ford.com/) ([F](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/F?feed_item_type=news&fr=1&)) combined.
