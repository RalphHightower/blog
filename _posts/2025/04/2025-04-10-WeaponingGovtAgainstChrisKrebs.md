title: "Trump Weaponizes Federal Government to Persecute Truth Told By Cybersecurity Expert Chris Krebs"
---

## ['Prosecute' vs. 'Persecute' – Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/grammar/prosecuted-vs-persecuted-usage)

“One you do in court, the other you do if you're a jerk.”

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is using the [Justice Department (DOJ)](https://www.justice.gov/) and [Homeland Security (DHS)](https://www.dhs.gov/) to persecute his perceived political enemies. 

These two Executive Orders from [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) are actually the opposite of what the titles convey. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) lives in an *"alternate reality"*[^11]; what is right is wrong, what is up is down.

*The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)'s new efforts to target [Christopher Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/) and [Miles Taylor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miles-taylor-65707671/) are so radical that [Liz Cheney](https://www.congress.gov/member/liz-cheney/C001109) described the tactics as “Stalinesque.”*

April 10, 2025, 8:58 AM EDT
By Steve Benen

On the surface, the principal problem with the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) hysteria about the [Biden administration](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) “weaponizing” the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) is that the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) conspiracy theories were absurd. There was never any credible evidence to suggest the [Democratic White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) or [Attorney General Merrick Garland](https://www.msnbc.com/jonathan-capehart/watch/the-biden-official-who-let-trump-get-away-with-it-224034885922) abused their powers or politicized federal law enforcement in any way, at any time, in any case.

But just below the surface, there was a related problem: The [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) hysteria was also ironic. It was [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), in his first term, who did exactly what the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) falsely accused [Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) of doing: There’s overwhelming and uncontested evidence that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) spent much of his first term trying to transform agencies and officials — including prosecutors — [into his own personal attack dogs](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/prosecutions-marco-rubio-trump-biden-memory-rcna160742).

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s former [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) chief of staff, retired [Gen. John Kelly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kelly), went so far as to alert the public to the fact that the president “[regularly](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/13/us/politics/trump-irs-investigations.html)” wanted to use the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) [to retaliate against critics](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/john-kelly-trump-wanted-irs-target-perceived-political-foes-rcna57033).

In the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)’s [second term](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/), he’s picking up where he left off — and by some measures, making matters worse. [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/trump-orders-probes-two-former-officials-defied-rcna200523):

[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) directed federal agencies Wednesday to revoke the security clearances and review the activities of two high-level former government officials who questioned his election fraud claims and his conduct in his [first term](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/).

Let’s take these one at a time.

> *[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) fired [Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/) — not because he’d done anything wrong but because the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) wanted him to go along with his lies about the [election results](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf).*

During [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [first term](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/), [Christopher Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/) led the [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/)’s [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)](https://www.cisa.gov/), which was responsible for combatting foreign interference in our elections and preventing attacks. [Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/) earned bipartisan praise for his work, and after the [2020 election cycle](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf), [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/)’s [David Ignatius](https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/david-ignatius/) [noted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trump-and-his-supporters-are-discovering-how-hard-it-is-to-sabotage-election-results/2020/11/17/96d37bbe-290e-11eb-9b14-ad872157ebc9_story.html), “When the history books about this [election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf) are written, [Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/) will be one of the heroes.”

The day [Ignatius](https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/david-ignatius/)’ column was published, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [fired Krebs](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-fires-one-heroes-2020-telling-truth-n1248089) — not because he’d done anything wrong but because the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) wanted him to go along with his lies about the [election results](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf). When [Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/) instead told the truth, he was shown the door.

Four and a half years later, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) issued an order that not only described [Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/) as a “significant bad-faith actor who weaponized and abused his Government authority” — a claim the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) made while abusing his [government authority](https://www.usa.gov/) — it also directed [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) and the [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/) to “review” [Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/)’ work and activities.

[Miles Taylor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miles-taylor-65707671/), meanwhile, was a former high-ranking official in [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/) who [became a prominent Trump critic](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/anonymous-white-house-author-comes-forward-n1245161), alerting the public to allegations that he personally witnessed the president’s corruption and ineptitude.

> *This is simply not the sort of thing that’s supposed to happen in a stable and healthy democracy.*

[Trump’s order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/addressing-risks-associated-with-an-egregious-leaker-and-disseminator-of-falsehoods/), which called on the [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/) to investigate [Taylor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miles-taylor-65707671/)’s activities, also said [Taylor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miles-taylor-65707671/) “stoked dissension.” Just as notably, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), who has [repeatedly disclosed sensitive information](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/problems-trumps-executive-order-disclosing-sensitive-information-rcna188592), suggested that his critic had “disclosed sensitive information,” adding, “[T]his conduct could properly be characterized as treasonous.”

Putting aside the obvious concern that such rhetoric is insane, it’s also worth emphasizing that “treason” is a word the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [uses far too often](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-amplifies-radical-retaliatory-message-targeting-liz-cheney-rcna159915), especially given that treason [is a capital offense](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-wants-jan-6-committee-members-charged-treason-rcna73943).

But as important as these details are, let’s not miss the forest for the trees: A sitting [American](https://www.usa.gov/) [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) signed executive orders seeking investigations into former officials, not because they did anything wrong, but because they defied him. This is simply not the sort of thing that’s supposed to happen in a stable and healthy democracy. Former [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Liz Cheney](https://www.congress.gov/member/liz-cheney/C001109) of [Wyoming](https://www.wyoming.gov/) described [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s latest moves as “[Stalinesque](https://x.com/Liz_Cheney/status/1910127401427992702).”

Indeed, if an investigative reporter had uncovered evidence that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) had done this in private — quietly directing agencies to investigate critics without cause — it would be a front-page scandal. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), however, did it in public, practically bragging about his own abuse.

But as [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Chris Murphy](https://www.murphy.senate.gov/) of [Connecticut](https://www.ct.gov/) [recently noted](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-turns-white-house-lawn-car-lot-megadonor-musk-rcna196000) in an unrelated matter, “Just because the corruption plays out in public doesn’t mean it’s not corruption.”

### [Addressing Risks from Chris Krebs and Government Censorship – The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/addressing-risks-from-chris-krebs-and-government-censorship/)

[PRESIDENTIAL](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) ACTIONS
[Presidential](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) Memoranda
April 9, 2025
MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES

The [Federal Government](https://www.usa.gov/agency-index) has a constitutional duty and a moral responsibility to respect and promote the [free speech rights](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/) of [Americans](https://www.usa.gov/). Yet in recent years, elitist leaders in Government have unlawfully censored speech and weaponized their undeserved influence to silence perceived political opponents and advance their preferred, and often erroneous, narrative about significant matters of public debate. These disgraceful actions have taken the form of coercive threats against the private sector — including major social media platforms — to suppress conservative or dissenting voices and distort public opinion. Much of this censorship took place during a [Presidential election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf) with the apparent purpose of undermining the free exchange of ideas and debate.

[Christopher Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/), the former head of the [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)](https://www.cisa.gov/), is a significant bad-faith actor who weaponized and abused his Government authority. [Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/)’ misconduct involved the censorship of disfavored speech implicating the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf) and COVID-19 pandemic. [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/), under [Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/)’ leadership, suppressed conservative viewpoints under the guise of combatting supposed disinformation, and recruited and coerced major social media platforms to further its partisan mission. [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/) covertly worked to blind the American public to the controversy surrounding Hunter Biden’s laptop. [Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/), through [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/), promoted the censorship of election information, including known risks associated with certain voting practices. Similarly, [Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/), through [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/), falsely and baselessly denied that the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf) was rigged and stolen, including by inappropriately and categorically dismissing widespread election malfeasance and serious vulnerabilities with voting machines. [Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/) skewed the bona fide debate about COVID-19 by attempting to discredit widely shared views that ran contrary to [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/)’s favored perspective.

Abusive conduct of this sort both violates the [First Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/) and erodes trust in [Government](https://www.usa.gov/agency-index), thus undermining the strength of our democracy itself. Those who engage in or support such conduct must not have continued access to our [Nation](https://www.usa.gov/agency-index)’s secrets. Accordingly, I hereby direct the heads of executive department and agencies (agencies) to immediately take steps consistent with existing law to revoke any active security clearance held by [Christopher Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/).

I further direct the [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/), the [Director of National Intelligence](https://www.dni.gov/), and all other relevant agencies to immediately take all action as necessary and consistent with existing law to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at entities associated with [Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/), including [SentinelOne](https://www.sentinelone.com/), pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest.

I further direct the [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) and the [Secretary of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/), in consultation with any other agency head, to take all appropriate action to review [Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/)’ activities as a [Government employee](https://www.usa.gov/), including his leadership of [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/). This review should identify any instances where [Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/)’ conduct appears to have been contrary to suitability standards for [Federal employees](h://www.usa.gov/), involved the unauthorized dissemination of classified information, or contrary to the purposes and policies identified in [Executive Order 14149](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/restoring-freedom-of-speech-and-ending-federal-censorship/) of January 20, 2025 [(Restoring Freedom of Speech and Ending Federal Censorship)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/restoring-freedom-of-speech-and-ending-federal-censorship/). As part of that review, I direct a comprehensive evaluation of all of [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/)’s activities over the last 6 years, focusing specifically on any instances where [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/)’s conduct appears to have been contrary to the purposes and policies identified in [Executive Order 14149](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/restoring-freedom). Upon completing these reviews, the [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) and the [Secretary of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/) shall prepare a joint report to be submitted to the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), through the Counsel to the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), with recommendations for appropriate remedial or preventative actions to be taken to fulfill the purposes and policies of [Executive Order 14149](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/restoring-freedom).

This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/), its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Fact Sheet
The White House
April 9, 2025
**RESTORING TRUST IN GOVERNMENT**: Today, [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald J. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) signed a [Presidential Memorandum](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/addressing-risks-from-chris-krebs-and-government-censorship/) revoking any active security clearance held by [Chris Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/) and his associates.

- The [Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/addressing-risks-from-chris-krebs-and-government-censorship/) directs the head of every federal agency to immediately revoke any active security clearance held by [Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/).
- The [Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/addressing-risks-from-chris-krebs-and-government-censorship/) also suspends any active security clearance held by individuals at entities associated with [Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/), including [SentinelOne](https://www.sentinelone.com/), pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest.
- Furthermore, the [Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/addressing-risks-from-chris-krebs-and-government-censorship/) calls for a review of [Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/)’ activities as a government employee, including his leadership of the [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)](https://www.cisa.gov/).
- The review will include a comprehensive evaluation of all of [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/)’s activities over the last 6 years and will identify any instances where [Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/)’ or [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/)’s conduct appears to be contrary to the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s commitment to [free speech](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/) and [ending federal censorship](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/restoring-freedom-of-speech-and-ending-federal-censorship/), including whether [Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/)’ conduct was contrary to suitability standards for [federal employees](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/restoring-freedom-of-speech-and-ending-federal-censorship/) or involved the unauthorized dissemination of classified information.

**ENDING GOVERNMENT CENSORSHIP**: [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is committed to ending government censorship of [Americans](https://www.usa.gov/) and believes that those who engage in such conduct should not have access to our nation’s secrets.

- [Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/), the former head of [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/), is a significant bad-faith actor who weaponized and abused his government authority.
- [Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/), through [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/):<br />Suppressed conservative viewpoints under the guise of combatting purported misinformation, and recruited and coerced major social media platforms to further its partisan mission.<br />Covertly worked to blind the [American](https://www.usa.gov/) public to the controversy surrounding Hunter Biden’s laptop.
Promoted the censorship of election information, including known risks associated with certain voting practices, and falsely and baselessly denied that the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf) was rigged and stolen, including by inappropriately and categorically dismissing widespread election malfeasance and serious vulnerabilities with voting machines.
Skewed the bona fide debate about COVID-19 by attempting to discredit widely shared views that ran contrary to [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/)’s favored perspective.

**ENSURING LOYALTY AND ACCOUNTABILITY**: [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has made clear that loyalty to the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) must come before personal or partisan agendas, taking decisive action against those who misuse their undeserved influence to deceive the [American](https://www.usa.gov/) public.

- [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) already revoked the security clearances held by intelligence officials who falsely claimed Hunter Biden’s laptop was [Russian](http://government.ru/) disinformation during the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf).
- On Day One, [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) Trump signed an [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/addressing-risks-from-chris-krebs-and-government-censorship/) to restore freedom of speech, dismantling federal programs that censored dissenting voices under the guise of combating misinformation, ensuring government serves the people—not partisan narratives.
- That same day, [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) signed an [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/addressing-risks-from-chris-krebs-and-government-censorship/) ending the [weaponization of the federal government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-the-weaponization-of-the-federal-government/).
- These decisive actions underscore [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s pledge to ensure a transparent government that is loyal and accountable to the people.
