That's 
## [Trump pretends he never suggested potentially firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-jerome-powell-termination-no-plans-federal-reserve-rcna202577)

*The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) might want to admit that he’s retreating, but it’ll probably be awhile before he echoes his own rhetoric about the Fed chair's “termination.”*

To hear [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) tell it, there was just a big misunderstanding, and he really has “no intention” of firing [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) [Chair Jerome Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm). [The Washington Post reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/22/trump-presidency-news-hegseth/#link-3POLV5SPZFFHXNQYBKC3Q7XFXU):

> *[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said he has “no intention” of firing [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) [Chair Jerome H. Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm), despite his recent criticism and the pressure the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has put on the leader of the [central bank](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) to cut interest rates more quickly. Asked whether he intends to fire [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) if interest rates are not lowered soon, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said, “I don’t want to talk about that because I have no intention of firing him.” Pressed again about efforts to remove him, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) said there are “none whatsoever.”*

For good measure, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) added that he “never” had any intention of trying to oust the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) [chair](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm). “The press runs away with things,” he added.

April 17: In [an item](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114352766082542122) published to his social media platform, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wrote that the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) [chair](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) is “always” wrong, adding, “[Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm)’s termination cannot come fast enough!”

April 17: Hours later, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said he’s never been “fond of” [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm), and suggested that the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) [chair](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) — whom he first appointed — is [“politically” conspiring against him](https://x.com/Acyn/status/1912929943996248400).

April 17: Around the same time, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) bragged about his power to fire the “terrible” [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) [chair](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm). “If I want him out, he’ll be out of there real fast, believe me,” the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) told reporters, adding that he believes [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) is failing to “do the job.”

April 18: Kevin Hassett, the chair of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s National Economic Council, said [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) officials would “continue to study” whether [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) could be fired.

April 21: [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) published [another online item](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)/114376239725335883), called [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) a “major loser” and accused the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) [chair](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) of having secretly conspired to help [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) win elections.

It was against this backdrop that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) effectively told reporters, “Who, me? [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm)? Who said anything about trying to fire [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm)?”

There’s no great mystery here: When [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) targeted the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) [chair](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm), markets fell sharply, reinforcing the impression that investors care more about keeping [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) in place than keeping the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) in place.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) might want to admit that he’s retreating, but it’ll probably be a while before he echoes his own rhetoric about “[Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm)’s termination.”
