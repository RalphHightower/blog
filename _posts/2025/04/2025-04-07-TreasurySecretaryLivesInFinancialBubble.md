## [Treasury secretary interview offers timely reminder: There are no adults in the room](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/treasury-secretary-interview-offers-timely-reminder-are-no-adults-room-rcna199959)

*Many hoped [Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/) [Secretary Scott Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) would be a voice of reason on [Team Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). Amid the crisis caused by tariffs, those hopes have since evaporated.*

April 7, 2025, 8:52 AM EDT
By Steve Benen

On Wednesday afternoon, shortly after stock market trading had wrapped up for the day, [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) kicked off a trade war with sweeping international trade tariffs. On Thursday, Wall Street followed international markets off a cliff.

It was at that point that [Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/) [Secretary Scott Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) said, in apparent seriousness, that the two developments might’ve been unrelated.

“For everyone who thinks these market declines are all based on the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s economic policies, I can tell you that this market decline started with the [Chinese](https://www.gov.cn/) AI announcement of [DeepSeek](https://github.com/deepseek-ai),” [Bessent told](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/treasurys-bessent-market-drop-mag-185141328.html) far-right media personality [Tucker Carlson](https://tuckercarlson.com/), in an interview that was released on Friday.

Two days later, [as NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/bessent-americans-retire-arent-worried-stock-market-recession-rcna199892), the [Cabinet secretary](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) kept talking, though he hardly made matters any better.

> *In an interview with [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/)’ “[Meet the Press](https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press-full-episodes),” [Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) called it a “false narrative” that people who are close to retiring may be reluctant after their retirement savings may have dropped last week because of the stock market downturn. “I think that’s a false narrative,” he told moderator Kristen Welker. “[Americans](https://www.usa.gov/) who want to retire right now, the [Americans](https://www.usa.gov/) who put away for years in their savings accounts, I think they don’t look at the day-to-day fluctuations.”*

Perhaps [Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) should have conversations with a wider range of people — because there were countless [Americans](https://www.usa.gov/) looking at the “day-to-day fluctuaqtions” in their retirement accounts last week.

In the same interview, the [treasury secretary](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) — ostensibly one of the most powerful and influential figures on the planet when it comes to the economy and financial markets — told host [mKristen Welker, “[W]hat I’ve been very impressed with is the market infrastructure, that we had record volume on Friday and everything is working very smoothly. So, the [American](https://www.usa.gov/) people, they can be very, take great comfort in that.”

Why would [Americans](https://www.usa.gov/) take “great comfort” in the fact that trillions of dollars of wealth disappeared “very smoothly”? I’m not sure, though [Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) delivered the line as if he believed it made sense. It did not.

Stepping back, it’s worth emphasizing that [Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) was hardly seen as a controversial [Cabinet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/) choice for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). On the contrary, he was seen as one of the president’s most mainstream personnel choices for his second term, and the [Treasury secretary](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) was confirmed with [more Democratic votes](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1191/vote_119_1_00019.htm) than most of his fellow secretaries.

Upon his confirmation, many hoped that [Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) would be a voice of reason in the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/). On a team filled with cranks and charlatans, [Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) might be in a position to steer the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) in responsible directions, serving as the proverbial “adult in the room.”

But those hopes have been dashed. As [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/)’s [Catherine Rampell](https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/catherine-rampell/) recently summarized [in a column](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/02/04/rubio-bessent-trump-administration/) focused on the [treasury secretary](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent), “The ‘adults in the room’ sometimes failed in [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s first term. Now, they’re not even pretending to try.”

[MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/)’s [Stephanie Ruhle](https://www.msnbc.com/11th-hour) [told viewers](https://newrepublic.com/post/193634/donald-trump-treasury-scott-bessent-tariffs-quit), “My sources say that [Scott Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) is kind of the odd man out here and, in the inner circle that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has, he’s not even close to [Scott Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) or listening to him. Some have said to me, he’s looking for an exit door to try to get himself to the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/), because in the last few days he’s really hurting his own credibility and history in the markets.”

Of course, if [Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) is worried about salvaging his credibility, he might already be too late.

@RalphHightower: [Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) has already tarnished his reputation by signing on with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is a resume killer
