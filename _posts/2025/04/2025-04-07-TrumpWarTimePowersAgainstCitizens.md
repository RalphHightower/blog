## [It’s a terrifying time for free speech and civil liberties in Trump’s America](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-free-speech-immigration-us-citizens-rcna199629)

*We don’t have to imagine what [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) would do with wartime powers. He's already doing it, and U.S. citizens could be next.*

April 4, 2025, 3:08 PM EDT
By Anthony L. Fisher, Senior Editor, MSNBC Daily

[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is running headlong into his radical reimagining of [America](https://www.usa.gov/agency-index) — one in which freedom of speech, basic civil liberties and equal protection under the law are privileges to be bestowed by the state, rather than inalienable rights for everyone. At the same time, he’s also made the country less safe and the government less accountable to the people.

In less than three months, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)(https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) have [fired inspectors general](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-inspectors-general-fired-waste-fraud-rcna195931), used the threat of government sanctions to [compel law firms](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/big-law-divided-white-houses-campaign-law-firms-intensifies-rcna199496) and universities into making payoffs and [curricula changes](https://www.msnbc.com/weekends-with-alex-witt/watch/columbia-students-and-alumni-protest-university-s-agreement-to-trump-demands-235772485612), launched speech-chilling [investigations into media companies](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/fcc-chairman-brendan-carr-democrats-probe-rcna199124), equated protests against a foreign government’s war (a war that’s [unpopular even among that government’s own citizens](https://www.timesofisrael.com/69-of-israelis-54-of-coalition-voters-back-ending-war-in-exchange-for-hostages-poll/) with [support for terrorism](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/mahmoud-khalil-ice-arrest-columbia-free-speech-rcna195699), and deported, [without due process](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/joe-rogan-ann-coulter-break-with-trump-immigration-rcna199344), innocent people present in the U.S. legally. And that’s hardly a comprehensive summary. 

> [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) does not believe he is constrained by the law, and the [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) seems to agree, having granted the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) immunity for almost any official action.

It seems like a lifetime ago, but it has been barely more than two months since [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [pardoned nearly every Jan. 6 rioter](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/granting-pardons-and-commutation-of-sentences-for-certain-offenses-relating-to-the-events-at-or-near-the-united-states-capitol-on-january-6-2021/) — [including those who attacked police](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-jan-6-rioters-pardons-back-the-blue-rcna188849) and threatened to murder the [vice president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/), and the [leaders of neo-fascist militant groups](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/04/25/proud-boys-trial-trump-tarrio-00093678) [argued in court](https://apnews.com/article/capitol-siege-riots-donald-trump-conspiracy-government-and-politics-def7c6a17cac57d1b3dff64e923afef7) that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) incited the assault on the [Capitol](https://www.congress.gov/). 

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) might be obsessed with projecting what he views as “strength,” but in an incredibly short period of time, he’s made [America](https://www.usa.gov/) increasingly [vulnerable to terror](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-doge-cuts-domestic-terrorism-national-security-rcna197888) and [cyber attacks](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-election-security-cisa-rcna195867), viruses that could launch another pandemic and [tanked millions of people’s retirement funds](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-speech-tariffs-fact-check-white-house-rcna199456). 

Beginning in the summer of 2015, when it was clear that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s candidacy was not a fluke and that he could win the [2016 Trumpian nomination](https://www.gop.com/), I anxiously wondered for years what [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) would do in a “Black Swan” situation, like a major terror attack. I [don’t really wonder anymore](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-[president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)-sept-11-anniversary-rcna170544) — because he’s already doing it. 

The [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) and The Handbasket reported this week that [Secretary of State](https://www.state.gov/) [Marco Rubio](https://www.state.gov/biographies/marco-rubio/) issued a cable to diplomats ordering them to scrutinize visa applicants’ social media for any criticism of the [U.S.](https://www.usa.gov/) and [Israel](https://www.gov.il/). “This may be evident in conduct that bears a hostile attitude toward U.S. citizens or U.S. culture (including government, institutions, or founding principles). Or it may be evident in advocacy or sympathy for foreign terrorist organizations. All of these matters may open lines of inquiry regarding the applicant’s credibility and purpose of travel,” [the cable reportedly reads](https://www.thehandbasket.co/p/state-dept-enhanced-social-media-vetting-student-visa-applicants). 

We’re only weeks removed from the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) using a [very loose definition](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-deportation-mahmoud-khalil-arrest-legal-loopholes-rcna196727) of “support for Hamas” as a pretext for deportations of legal immigrants. But does the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) also view “sympathy” for Gazan civilians — suffering in unspeakable conditions as a result of the [Israel](https://www.gov.il/)-Hamas war — or criticism of the [Israeli government](https://www.gov.il/) to be “advocacy or sympathy for foreign terrorist organizations”? The answer is almost certainly: yes. 

How about a legal permanent resident, not a pro-Palestinian activist, expressing criticism of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)? Would that constitute “a hostile attitude toward U.S. citizens or U.S. culture (including government, institutions, or founding principles)”? Again, almost certainly: yes. 

Presumably, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) supporters critical of the so-called Deep State — composed of [U.S. government](https://www.usa.gov/) and institutions — would receive a pass. The same likely goes for [MAGA thought leaders](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-right-pro-russia-anti-ukraine-zelensky-putin-rcna193564) who [reject some of America’s founding principles](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/01/30/curtis-yarvins-ideas-00201552) — like its opposition to monarchy. 

> We have plenty of reason for concern that a [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-led government might exploit the trauma and chaos of a crisis to deny American citizens their rights.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s deputy chief of policy, Stephen Miller, [defended the administration’s position on denying due process to immigrants](https://x.com/Acyn/status/1907226034447261885) on [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) earlier this week: “They have the temerity to say that every single invader should get their own individual judicial trial before they are deported. One at a time, each one gets a one million-dollar trial in front of a communist judge to decide whether or not we can send them home. How about, ‘Hell no.’”

But due process doesn’t necessarily mean the accused stands trial. It does mean the government has to at least give you the opportunity to say something like, “I’m not a violent gang member! I’m a law-abiding, tax-paying, legal resident with a family here.” And it means agents of the state have to actually check out that claim before they deprive you of your civil rights. 

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) — a [convicted felon](https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2022/statement-attorney-general-james-guilty-verdict-trump-organization) whose lawyers [used his rights to due process to drag out legal proceedings](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-deportations-tren-de-aragua-alien-enemies-due-process-rcna197108) long enough for the indictments to become moot by his re-election — leads an [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) that conducts arrests and deportations without due process and [ignores court orders](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-conservatives-threatening-judicial-system-rcna192109). His [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) is [already claiming war powers under the Alien Enemies Act](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/judge-boasberg-trump-alien-enemies-act-argument-rcna198463), even though we are not at war. 

But if this country were hit by a major attack, we have no reason to expect the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) will consider itself restrained by the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/), or that “suspects” will be afforded due process. We do, however, have plenty of reason for concern that a [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-led [government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) might exploit the trauma and chaos of a crisis to deny American citizens their rights, if they’re deemed “the enemy” by this [rogue administration](https://www.https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/). 

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) does not believe he is constrained by the law, and the [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) seems to agree, having granted the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) immunity for almost any official action. He and his allies are already musing about [ignoring the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/) and pursuing a third term](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-third-term-election-2028-rcna198855) in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/). Think about that kind of unchecked power being used after a terror attack. A grieving, frightened populace could be frightened into surrendering whatever civil liberties they have left. And even if they don’t, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) could potentially suspend them anyway — just as he is now, when we’re not at war. 

As unsettling as the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s actions have been, it has provided a helpful reminder that civil liberties, due process and free speech are meant to apply to all Americans —  and everyone else here legally. 

It’s equally instructive to watch a reactionary [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) — whose members absurdly cosplay as “[free speech warriors](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-vance-free-speech-phonies-first-amendment-rcna163102)” — mimic the same excesses of left-wing activists and politicians who advocated for the government and other authorities to be the arbiters of “hate speech” and “disinformation.” You can replace those words with “terrorist sympathies,” but the impulse is the same. The censor is certain they possess the absolute truth. 

To be very clear, the left-wing campus “cancel culture” of roughly the past decade cannot remotely be conflated with what the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) is doing. While many expressions of recent progressive campus activism have been counterproductive, illiberal and hypocritical, left-wing cancel culture never sent masked federal agents in plainclothes to abduct a [abduct a grad student off a city street in broad daylight](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/tufts-university-student-detained-authoritarian-rcna198410) over an op-ed protesting a foreign government. 

Authentic free speech and civil liberties advocates have consistently tried to remind Americans that the right to express what some people might consider to be truly horrible things is the entire point of free speech. Popular speech needs no protections. Unpopular speech does. And right now, the [government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has a frighteningly overbroad view of what speech it deems unacceptable. It also doesn’t believe it’s constrained by the law or the courts or distinctions between war and peacetime.
