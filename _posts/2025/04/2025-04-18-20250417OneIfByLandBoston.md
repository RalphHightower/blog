Adam Balsam captured the latest work tonight by Silence Dogood, a local artists' collective using one of Ben Franklin's pen names to spread the word against tyranny, in this case by updating Paul Revere's signal message on the side of Old North Church - the night before the 250th anniversary of the signal being put up in the spire for him.
