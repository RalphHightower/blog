This year‚Äôs [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Easter Egg Roll](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/04/first-lady-melania-trump-previews-2025-white-house-easter-egg-roll-activities/) event will feature activities ‚Äúcourtesy‚Äù of a number of corporate sponsors, including several tech companies that made financial contributions to [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs inaugural committee. According to a [statement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/04/first-lady-melania-trump-previews-2025-white-house-easter-egg-roll-activities/) from [first lady](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/melania-trump/) [Melania Trump](https://youtu.be/OpRqJH549II?si=88RBxIip1DyqQAKx/)‚Äôs office, the Monday event will have activities sponsored by an array of organizations.

These include a ‚Äúreading nook‚Äù by [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/), a ‚Äúbunny hop stage‚Äù by [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) and an ‚ÄúAI-powered experience and photo opportunity‚Äù by [Meta](https://www.meta.com/) ‚Äî further underscoring how several tech giants are cozying up to the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/). A [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) spokesperson said in a statement that the company has participated in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Easter Egg Roll](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/04/first-lady-melania-trump-previews-2025-white-house-easter-egg-roll-activities/) in the past ‚Äúand we do so in line with the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)‚Äôs process.‚Äù [Meta](https://www.meta.com/) declined to [comment to Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/19/white-house-egg-roll-sponsors-00299714) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) did not respond to its request for comment; both corporations [donated \$1 million to Trump‚Äôs inauguration fund](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/bezos-zuckerberg-altman-trump-inauguraton-donations-rcna184179).

The [Easter Egg Roll](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/04/first-lady-melania-trump-previews-2025-white-house-easter-egg-roll-activities/) will also feature the traditional egg roll and egg hunt, with eggs ‚Äúdonated by American egg farmers,‚Äù the first lady‚Äôs office said. According to the [American Egg Board](https://www.incredibleegg.org/), about 2,500 dozen eggs ‚Äî or 30,000 eggs ‚Äî are being provided for the egg roll, at a time when [egg prices for consumers have soared](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/us/politics/egg-prices-march.html).

[CNN first reported](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/23/politics/white-house-easter-egg-roll-corporate-sponsorships/index.html) last month that it obtained a document soliciting corporate sponsorships for the annual [Easter Egg Roll](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/04/first-lady-melania-trump-previews-2025-white-house-easter-egg-roll-activities/) ranging from \$75,000 to \$200,000, with logo and branding opportunities offered in return. The money raised is slated to go toward the [White House Historical Association](https://www.whitehousehistory.org/), a nonprofit that preserves the history of the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/) reported. The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) did not respond to [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/)‚Äôs request for comment ([MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) and [NBC News](https://https://www.nbcnews.com/) have not verified the document seen by [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/)).

Corporate sponsorships for such an event [are unusual](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/19/white-house-egg-roll-sponsors-00299714). But they would track with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs willingness to entertain overtures from private companies, a move that has [raised ethical questions](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/24/trump-inauguration-committee-ceo-donations.html) in the past. After the [2024 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/2024presgeresults.pdf), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs inaugural committee raised hundreds of [hundreds of millions of dollars from corporate America](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-inauguration-funding-record-breaking-ae6a811e), and [multiple tech executives](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5040426-apple-tim-cook-donald-trump-visit/) who sought to curry favor with the incoming [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) paid [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) a personal visit at his [Mar-a-Lago resort](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) ahead of his swearing-in.
