## [Elon Musk’s SpaceX pleads with Trump for tariff exemptions](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/03/31/elon-musks-spacex-pleads-trump-for-tariff-exemptions/)

Story by James Titcomb • March 31, 2025

[Elon Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/)’s [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/) is seeking to avoid tariffs on equipment imported from [China](https://www.gov.cn/) as [Donald Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) prepares to [escalate his trade war](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/03/31/ftse-100-markets-latest-news-trump-tariffs-putin-oil-russia/).

The [rocket company](https://www.spacex.com/) has asked the [US government](https://www.usa.gov/) for exemptions on two pieces of [Chinese](https://www.gov.cn/)-made manufacturing equipment used to produce broadband terminals for its [Starlink satellite internet business](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/12/08/elon-musks-satellites-to-tackle-mobile-not-spots/).

In filings with the [US Trade Representative](http://www.ustr.gov/), it said it was currently unable to procure the equipment in the US and that they helped support American manufacturing.

[Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/)’s fondness for tariffs has emerged as a potential wedge between the [US president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) and [Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/).

The [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) and [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/) boss has been described as [Trump’s “first buddy”](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2025/01/14/first-buddy-elon-musk-office-white-house-complex/) and has been a regular presence in the [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), while the president has sought to help [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) by promoting the electric car maker in front of the White House.

[Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/), the world’s richest man, has admitted that Trump’s trade war has the [potential to hurt his business empire](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/03/13/tesla-raises-alarm-about-trump-tariffs-despite-musks-white/). He has largely refrained from personally criticising tariffs, despite saying before last year’s election that he was against them.

Tesla lobbied the White House this month warning that it was exposed to retaliation and that the duties could increase the cost of US manufacturing. [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/) has appeared more open to tariffs, saying that other countries are imposing unfair costs on the company.

However, in two requests to the [US Trade Representative](https://www.ustr.gov/) last week, [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/) requested tariff exemptions on equipment used to print and solder circuit boards.

One is an industrial soldering system made by [Illinois Tool Works (ITW)](https://www.itw.com/), an American company that manufactures in [China](https://www.gov.cn/). The other is a circuit board printing machine made in [China](https://www.gov.cn/) by the Japanese company [Fuji](https://www.fiji.gov.fj/).

The equipment have [25pc import tariffs](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/0/impact-of-trump-trade-tariffs-on-uk-world/) under rules introduced during Trump’s first administration.

[Space X](https://www.spacex.com/) to move production to US in 2026
[SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/) told the [[USTR](http://www.ustr.gov/) that [ITW](https://www.itw.com/) was planning to move production of the soldering system to the US in 2026 but that in the meantime there was not an alternative that was validated for company usage.

“Once production is moved to the US, [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/) will procure domestically to support US production,” its application said.

It said the [Fuji](https://www.fiji.gov.fj/) system was available from alternative non-US sources but only at a higher cost.

[SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/) said they are used to “support production of over 90,000 units a week”, indicating they are used to make terminals for [Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/)’s satellite internet service, [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/). The company said last year that its [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/) factory in [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) is capable of producing 90,000 broadband terminals a week.

Securing an exemption would reduce the targeted tariff from 25pc to 0pc, although the imports would still be subject to the blanket 20pc tariffs [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) has introduced in his second term.

The tariffs in question date back to [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/)’s first administration, when he introduced duties on hundreds of billions of dollars of [Chinese](https://www.gov.cn/) imports such as machinery. The [Biden administration](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) maintained the tariffs but last October allowed US manufacturers to apply for exemptions.

The exemption can take 30 days to be approved, and would only apply until the end of May, meaning [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/) may have to rush to import equipment if it is able to bypass the tariffs.

[Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) warned the [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) administration this month that tariffs could increase its costs and expose the company to retaliation from foreign countries.

“US exporters are inherently exposed to disproportionate impacts when other countries respond to US trade actions,” it said in an unsigned letter. [Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/) has said that “the cost impact [of tariffs] is not trivial”.

[SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/), meanwhile, railed at taxes in other countries, and pointed out that foreign companies do not face similar barriers in the US.

The company’s [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/) system, which is [widely used in Ukraine’s defence](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/03/04/britain-france-plot-replace-musk-starlink-ukraine/) against [Russia](http://government.ru/), has become swept up in politics in recent months. [Italy](https://www.governo.it/) has halted negotiations with [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/) amid doubts over US support for [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/), while the [Canadian](https://www.canada.ca/) province of [Ontario](http://www.ontario.ca/page/) ripped up a contract with the company.

[SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/) was contacted for comment.
