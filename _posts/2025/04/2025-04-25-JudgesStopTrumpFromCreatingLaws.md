## [Judge blocked 'off-the-rails' Trump with order that won't be easy to reverse: legal expert](https://www.rawstory.com/judge-2671843169/)

Story by Travis Gettys. April 25, 2025.

A judge threw up a serious hurdle to [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s executive [order](https://www.rawstory.com/five-alarm-fire-expert-warns-trump-s-new-bully-tactic-is-on-2026-election/?) that would substantially roll back voting rights.

[U.S. District](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/) [Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/senior-judge-colleen-kollar-kotelly) paused the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)'s March 25 [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/preserving-and-protecting-the-integrity-of-american-elections/), titled "[Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/preserving-and-protecting-the-integrity-of-american-elections/)," instructing the independent [Election Assistance Commission](http://www.eac.gov/) to change the national mail voter registration form to require applicants to prove their U.S. citizenship, and former federal prosecutor [Joyce Vance wrote on her Substack page](https://joycevance.substack.com/p/the-executive-order-to-end-voting?r=yzqcr&triedRedirect=true) that the ruling would be difficult to overturn.

"District judges frequently write detailed opinions like this one when they want to make sure there is a solid basis for the courts of appeals to affirm their decisions and as little room as possible for them to reverse," [Vance](https://substack.com/@joycevance) wrote. "This is a detailed, well justified explanation that will not be easy for an appellate court to dismiss, and it’s not one-sided; it denies some of the relief the plaintiffs requested on technical legal grounds."

"[Judge Kollar-Kotelly](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/senior-judge-colleen-kollar-kotelly) starts with the basics, explaining what executive orders can and cannot be used for," [Vance](https://substack.com/@joycevance) added. "A president, she writes, 'cannot make new law or devise new [authority](https://www.rawstory.com/trump-voting-rights-executive-order/?) for himself — by executive order or otherwise. He may only wield those powers granted to him by [Congress](https, ://www.congress.gov/) or by the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/).'"

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wanted the [EAC](http://www.eac.gov/) to change its forms to require voters to prove their citizenship before registering to vote or updating their registration, but [Kollar-Kotelly](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/senior-judge-colleen-kollar-kotelly) blocked that provision.

"The reason our elections, which are held in all 50 states and over 3,100 counties, as well as in some territories and for military members and citizens abroad, are not consigned to the control of the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is fairly obvious," [Vance](https://substack.com/@joycevance) wrote. "The decentralization makes it more difficult for a [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) or his party to manipulate outcomes in national elections. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is nothing if not transparent in this regard."

The [order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/preserving-and-protecting-the-integrity-of-american-elections/) would have required voters to present a passport, Real ID, military identification card or other form of government-issued ID proving citizenship, but [Vance](https://substack.com/@joycevance) said millions of Americans don't have those documents readily available.

"So why do it?" [Vance](https://substack.com/@joycevance) wrote. "The only rationale offered, voter fraud, is something that has been proven, over and over, not to be a problem, especially in federal elections. It’s the same tired excuse used to make it more difficult for 'certain' qualified voters to exercise their rights."

The judge pointed out that the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/) authorizes [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) and the states, and not the president, to regulate federal elections, and [Vance](https://substack.com/@joycevance) said her ruling was a substantial bulwark against [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s attempts to consolidate power.

"A decision like this should be a foregone conclusion at the end of this case," [Vance](https://substack.com/@joycevance) wrote. "No [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) should try to usurp the power to control elections, let alone be able to do so. The [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/preserving-and-protecting-the-integrity-of-american-elections/) and the lawsuits challenging it underscore just how off the rails [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is. Every day, part of the spectacle of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is his assumption of the role of an [autocrat](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) at the expense of the American [presidency](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). And the risk is that it all becomes somehow normalized."
