[Pete Hegseth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/petehegseth/) has been accused of leaving himself open to hacking by America‚Äôs enemies by using his personal phone number in a top security [Signal](https://signal.org/) chat that was easily accessible on numerous internet sites and apps.

The embattled defense secretary‚Äôs phone number could be found in such diverse places as [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/), [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/), a fantasy sports site and reviews left for a plumber and a dentist, [according](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/us/politics/pete-hegseth-phone-signal.html).

It‚Äôs reportedly the same number linked to the [Signal](https://signal.org/) messaging app used by [Hegseth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/petehegseth/) to share details of imminent U.S. strikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen to his [Cabinet colleagues](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/) and, inadvertently, to Jeffrey Goldberg, editor of [The Atlantic magazine](https://www.theatlantic.com/).

He is also said to have included his wife, his brother, and his attorney in another [Signal](https://signal.org/) chat group in which he shared details of the strikes.

The latest twist in the ‚Äú[Signal](https://signal.org/)gate‚Äù scandal puts more pressure on [Hegseth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/petehegseth/) as he clings onto the [top Pentagon job](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/).

Cyber security experts claimed [Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) is a prime target for hackers. The [DoD](https://www.defense.gov/) [chief](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) would normally use high security classified communications systems, not their personal phone numbers.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs zero percent chance that someone hasn‚Äôt tried to install Pegasus or some other spyware on his phone. He is one of the top five, probably, most targeted people in the world for espionage,‚Äù Mike Casey, former director of the [National Counterintelligence and Security Center](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/ncsc-home), told the [Times](https://www.nytimes.com/).

‚ÄúYou just don‚Äôt want the secretary of defense‚Äôs phone number to be out there and available to anyone,‚Äù added Emily Harding, a security expert at the [Center for Strategic and International Studies](https://www.csis.org/).

The [Times](https://www.nytimes.com=) reports that [Hegseth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/petehegseth/)‚Äôs personal number was easily accessible as recently as March.

He is said to have used the name ‚Äú[PeteHegseth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/petehegseth/)‚Äù to sign onto [Sleeper.com](https://sleeper.com), a fantasy football and sports betting site, last August, with his wife Jennifer‚Äìwho was included in one of the chat groups‚Äìjoining up two weeks later.

He has a [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) page, a [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/) profile and also allegedly used the same phone to register for [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) [Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/teams/) and [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/).

His number is also said to be linked to an email address connected to a [Google](https;//www.google.com/) [Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) account that includes a number of reviews for local services.

He wrote of a dentist clinic, ‚ÄúThe staff is amazing‚Äù, and praised a plumber for their, ‚Äúfast, honest and quality work.‚Äù

Glenn S. Gerstell, a former general counsel for the [National Security Agency](,https://www.nsa.gov/), told the [Times](https://www.nytimes.com/): ‚ÄúIf you use your phone for just ordinary daily activities, you are leaving a highly, highly visible digital pathway that even a moderately sophisticated person, let alone a nefarious actor, can follow.‚Äù

‚ÄúPhone numbers are like the street address that tell you what house to break into. Once you get the street address, you get to the house, and there might be locks on the doors, and you ask yourself, ‚ÄòDo I have the tools to bypass or break the locks?‚Äô‚Äù another cyber security expert, James A. Lewis, said in the report.

‚ÄúI guarantee you [Russia](http://kremlin.ru/) and [China](https://www.gov.cn/) are all over the secretary of defense‚Äôs cellphone,‚Äù [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Don Bacon (T-NE2)](https://bacon.house.gov/) told [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/).

While [Signal](https://signal.org/)‚Äôs security is better than most other commercial messaging services, government cell phones are equipped with sophisticated anti-spyware systems.

Security experts say advanced malware is now available to hack personal phones without the user needing to download a link or being aware of the breach.

[Hegseth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/petehegseth/) is also reported to have installed [Signal](https://signal.org/) on his desk computer at the [Pentagon](https://www.defense.gov/), enabling him to exchange messages in an area where personal mobile phones are barred.

The [Pentagon](https://www.defense.gov/) has been contacted for comment.
