## [‘We are all afraid’: Trump Party’s Lisa Murkowski admits she fears retaliation](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/-are-afraid-gops-lisa-murkowski-admits-fears-retaliation-rcna201857)

*“I’m oftentimes very anxious myself about using my voice, because retaliation is real,” the [Trumpian](https://www.gop.com/) [senator](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/) conceded this week.*

More than any [Trumpian](https://www.gop.com/) in [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/), [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Lisa Murkowski](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/) of [Alaska](https://www.alaska.gov/) [counted on for candor](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/alaskas-lisa-murkowski-says-s-not-attached-republican-label-rcna184131) on for candor about the state of her party in the era of [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). In fact, late last year, about a month after the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) won a second term, [the senator conceded](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/alaskas-lisa-murkowski-says-s-not-attached-republican-label-rcna184131)± that she felt “more comfortable” with no party label than with “an identity as a [Trumpian](https://www.gop.com/).”

The comments came a few years after [Murkowski](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/) [also said](https://www.adn.com/politics/2021/01/08/alaska-sen-lisa-murkowski-calls-on-president-trump-to-resign-questions-her-future-as-a-republican/), in the wake of the [Jan. 6](https://www.webharvest.gov/congress117th/20221224173221/https://january6th.house.gov) attack, “If the [Trump Party](https://www.gop.com/) has become nothing more than the party of [Trump](,https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), I sincerely question whether this is the party for me.”

This week, the Alaskan raised eyebrows again with comments she hasn’t made publicly before. [The Anchorage Daily News reported](https://www.adn.com/politics/2025/04/14/we-are-all-afraid-speaking-to-alaska-nonprofit-leaders-murkowski-gets-candid-on-upheaval-in-federal-government/):

> *U.S. [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Lisa Murkowski](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/) told a room full of [Alaska](https://www.alaska.gov/) nonprofit leaders that the tumult of tariffs, executive orders, court battles, and cuts to federal services under the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) are exceptionally concerning. “We are all afraid,” [Murkowski](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/) said, taking a long pause. “It’s quite a statement. But we are in a time and a place where I certainly have not been here before. And I’ll tell ya, I’m oftentimes very anxious myself about using my voice, because retaliation is real. And that’s not right.”*

A video of the clip reinforced the impression that the senator chose her words with care.

At the same event, [Murkowski](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/) described [some of](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1191/vote_119_1_00056.htm) the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s recent moves as “unlawful” and “against the law.” She similarly expressed concern about the degree to which [USAID](https://www.usaid.gov/) had “just been obliterated,” described proposed Trump Party cuts to [Medicaid](https://www.medicaid.gov/) as “devastating” and efforts to politicize the [federal judiciary](https://www.uscourts.gov/) have brought the country to “a very dangerous place.”

Just as notably, the four-term [Trumpian](https://www.gop.com/) lawmaker acknowledged that [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) has allowed the executive branch to claim too much power. “It’s called the checks and balances. And right, now we are not balancing as the [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/),” [Murkowski](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/) said.

In recent days, as coverage of the [senator](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/)’s comments circulated, the broader conversation about her perspective has generally fallen into two camps. One was sympathetic: Many observers have noted that it’s exceedingly rare for any [congressional](https://www.congress.gov/) [Trumpian](https://www.gop.com/) to make comments like these, out loud and in public, and that [Murkowski](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/) is to be applauded for acknowledging the fears of retaliation that members feel.

The alternative reaction to her comments has been far less charitable: [Murkowski](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/) is in a position of influence, and she could be using her power far more effectively to push back against the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), its abuses, its corruption and its authoritarian tactics. There’s nothing wrong with applauding her comments, the argument goes, but it’s just as important to press the [Alaskan](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/) on her support for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-backed bills and some of the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s [highly unqualified](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1191/vote_119_1_00042.htm).

Indeed, let’s not forget that when the [Trumpian Party](https://www.gop.com/)’s far-right budget plan came to the [Senate](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/) floor a couple of weeks ago, two [Trump Party](https://www.gop.com/) [senators](https://www.senate.gov/) joined [Democrats](https:www.democrats.org/) in voting against it — and [Murkowski wasn’t one of the two](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1191/vote_119_1_00191.htm).

Which reaction is the right one? I don’t want this to sound like a cop-out, but I think both are right. I’m glad [Murkowski](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/) occasionally speaks out like this, and if it inspires some of her [Trump Party](https://www.gop.com/) colleagues to do the same, it could make a difference. I also believe that if [Murkowski](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/) recognizes the seriousness of our current circumstances, it’s incumbent on her to do more than just offer candid comments to her constituents.

As the [senator](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/) no doubt knows, she has other options — legislatively, procedurally, tactically, etc. — and if she really wants to shake things up, [Murkowski](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/) can announce that she’s ending her formal affiliation with the [Trump Party](https://www.gop.com/) altogether, even if she continues to caucus with the party.

It’s genuinely awful that she’s afraid and feeling “very anxious,” and I couldn’t agree more that the circumstances that have led to these fears are “not right.” But it’s within the [Alaskan](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/)’s power to help force a change, and I’ll continue to hope that she takes advantage of these opportunities.
