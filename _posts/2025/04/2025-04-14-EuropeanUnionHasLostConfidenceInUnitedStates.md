## [EU delivers Donald Trump blow with strategic China decision](https://the-express.com/news/world-news/168980/von-der-leyen-s-first-call-after-trump-s-reciprocal-tariffs-speech-china-168980)
  
Story by Richard Ashmore, John O'Sullivan. April 14, 2025

[Europe](https://commission.europa.eu/) appears to be shifting its gaze from west to east, as leaders lean towards [China](https://www gov.cn/) for trade agreements rather than aligning with [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) of the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/), with the news coming just days after [China](https://www gov.cn/)'s huge economic decision that was described as an 'act of hybrid warfare' and [described as an 'act of hybrid warfare' and designed to 'punish Trump.'](https://www.the-express.com/news/us-news/168910/china-s-british-steel-decision-act-hybrid-warfare-designed-punish-uk)

Euronews has reported that following [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s infamous "reciprocal tariffs" - [which China responded to with huge tariff hikes on certain goods](https://www.the-express.com/news/world-news/168758/china-donald-trump-increases-tariffs-us-goods-125) - speech at the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) earlier this month, the first call made by [European Commission](https://commission.europa.eu/) [President Ursula von der Leyen](https://commission.europa.eu/about/organisation/president_en) was to [China](https://www gov.cn/).

The [European Commission](https://commission.europa.eu/index_en), which had previously provided [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) a stern warning over his tariffs, issued an official statement saying: "In response to the widespread disruption caused by the US tariffs, [President von der Leyen](https://commission.europa.eu/about/organisation/president_en) stressed the responsibility of [Europe](https://commission.europa.eu/) and [China](https://www gov.cn/), as two of the world's largest markets, to support a strong reformed trading system, free, fair and founded on a level playing field.

The shift in focus comes after [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was slammed for saying that [Putin's latest attack on Ukraine which killed 34, including two children, was a 'mistake'](https://www.the-express.com/news/world-news/168983/donald-trump-s-response-putin-s-slaughter-ukrainian-children-slammed-preposterous).

[China](https://www gov.cn/) responded warmly, stating, "[China](https://www gov.cn/) is ready to work with the [European](https://commission.europa.eu/) side to promote the sound and steady development of [China](https://www gov.cn/)-[EU](https://commission.europa.eu/) relations."

Meanwhile, behind the scenes, a deal was being negotiated to resolve a long-standing issue in trade relations between [China](https://www gov.cn/) and [Europe](https://commission.europa.eu/), as [EU](https://commission.europa.eu/) leaders grow increasingly eager to stimulate trade.

On Friday night, it was revealed by the [EU Commission](https://commission.europa.eu/) that during discussions with [China](https://www gov.cn/), a significant concession had been agreed upon to explore solutions to the block on imports of [Chinese](https://www gov.cn/)-made electric vehicles, potentially through the introduction of a minimum pricing initiative.

An insider told [Euronews](https://www.euronews.com/): "The [EU](https://commission.europa.eu/) wants and needs to be seen as a reliable partner in the world. "In response to the widespread disruption caused by the [US tariffs](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/america-first-trade-policy/), [President von der Leyen](https://commission.europa.eu/about/organisation/president_en) stressed the responsibility of [Europe](https://commission.europa.eu/) and [China](https://www gov.cn/), as two of the world's largest markets, to support a strong reformed trading system, free, fair and founded on a level playing field.

"Beijing reciprocated with a warm message of their own, saying: "In that sense, the discussion with [China](https://www gov.cn/) is evolving because [China](https://www gov.cn/) is looking at us differently.

"I don't think the [European](https://commission.europa.eu/) approach towards [China](https://www gov.cn/) has changed completely, but the winds are moving."

Meanwhile, [European Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security](https://commission.europa.eu/about/departments-and-executive-agencies/trade-and-economic-security_en) [Maros Sefcovic](https://commission.europa.eu/about/organisation/college-commissioners/maros-sefcovic_en) jetted off to Washington today (Sunday) for conversations with U.S. officials.

This development follows [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s decision to halt [U.S. tariffs](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/america-first-trade-policy/) for 90 days, a move matched by the EU as it agreed to suspend its reciprocal measure.

In an unexpected pivot from his well-publicized tariff policies, the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) announced on Friday that certain electronic products, including smartphones and laptops, will not be hit by counter-tariffs aimed at [China](https://www gov.cn/).

Consequently, merchandise produced by American tech behemoth Apple, which depends on [Chinese](https://www gov.cn/) manufacturing, will escape the heavy 145% tariffs previously imposed on the [Asian nation](https://www gov.cn/).

The move seems to signal [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s acknowledgment that imposing tariffs on [China](https://www gov.cn/) will not promptly incentivize the return of sophisticated electronic manufacturing to American soil.
