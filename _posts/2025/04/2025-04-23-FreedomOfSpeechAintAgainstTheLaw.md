Five [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) members of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) traveled to [Louisiana](https://www.louisiana.gov/) on Tuesday to meet with two students in immigration detention whom the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) is seeking to deport over their political speech.

[Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Troy Carter (D-LA2)](https://troycarter.house.gov/), [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Bennie Thompson (D-MS2)](https://benniethompson.house.gov/) and three Massachusetts [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) — [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Edward J. Markey (D-MA)](https://www.markey.senate.gov/) and [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Ayanna Pressley (D-MA7)](https://pressley.house.gov/) and [Jim McGovern (D-MA2)](https://mcgovern.house.gov/) — visited [Mahmoud Khalil](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/mahmoud-khalil-letter-columbia-protest-trump-rcna197037), a legal U.S. permanent resident and Palestinian student activist, and [Rümeysa Öztürk](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/tufts-university-student-detained-authoritarian-rcna198410), a [Tufts University](https://www.tufts.edu/) student, at the immigration detention facilities where they are being held.

“The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) just feels it has the right to take people from across our country and put them into facilities like this,” [Markey](https://www.markey.senate.gov/) told reporters outside the facility in Basile, where Öztürk has been detained since her arrest in March. “It’s a national disgrace.”

Civil rights advocates say that Khalil’s and Öztürk’s detentions are [blatant violations of their right to free speech](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/08/nx-s1-5349472/students-protest-trump-free-speech-arrests-deportation-gaza). Khalil was a prominent leader in the [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) protests against [Israel](https://www.gov.il/)’s military assault on the Gaza Strip, and Öztürk, a [Turkish national](https://www.turkiye.gov.tr/), wrote an op-ed in the student newspaper criticizing her school’s response to the war.

The [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has accused both [Khalil](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/governments-case-mahmoud-khalil-shaky-reliant-tabloid-accounts-review-rcna201254) and [Öztürk](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/04/13/tufts-student-rumeysa-ozturk-rubio-trump/) of supporting Hamas without providing direct evidence for its claims. Neither of them has been charged with or convicted of any crime.

The [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/)’ visit this week is part of a larger effort to highlight the plight of those targeted by the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s sweeping immigration crackdown. Several [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [lawmakers](https://www.democrats.org/) have also [traveled to El Salvador](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/us/politics/abrego-garcia-el-salvador-democrats.html) to [meet with Kilmar Abrego Garcia](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kilmar-abrego-garcia-chris-van-hollen-meet-el-salvador-rcna201866), a [Maryland](https://moss-maryland-cdn.nicusa-gl.com/Pages/default.aspx) father with protected status whom the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) admitted to having mistakenly deported last month.

In an interview with [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/)’s [Rachel Maddow](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show) later Tuesday, [Carter](https://troycarter.house.gov/) said that detainees in one of the facilities they visited said the place was kept very cold and that some women told him that feminine hygiene products, as well as toilet paper, have not been provided.

“While they appear to be healthy, there are a lot of challenges at these facilities that require immediate attention,” [Carter](https://troycarter.house.gov/) said.

Öztürk has spoken of the [“unsanitary, unsafe, and inhumane” conditions in the facility in Basile](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/tufts-student-grabbed-street-ice-says-hijab-removed-asthma-not-treated-rcna201122). She said that she has suffered multiple untreated asthma attacks while there, and that her hijab was taken off without her consent.

Khalil’s wife said Monday that he [missed the birth of his first child](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/mahmoud-khalil-birth-son-wife-ice-deny-temporary-release-rcna202382) when [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement](https://www.ice.gov/) denied his request for temporary release.
