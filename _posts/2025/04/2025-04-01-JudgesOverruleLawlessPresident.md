## [Trumpians in Congress move to restrict federal judges who have blocked President Trump](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/01/trump-republicans-congress-federal-judges-court/82747150007/)

Story by Riley Beggin, USA TODAY. April 1, 2025

WASHINGTON – [President Donald Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) is getting help from some [powerful Trumpian allies](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/13/republicans-win-house-senate-2024/75734400007/) this week in [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) as he chafes at [court rulings restricting his early actions](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/22/trump-musk-doge-overhaul-judges-review/82583272007/) on everything from [immigration](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/31/judge-blocks-noem-tps-venezuela/82748677007/) to [shuttering federal agencies](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/12/trump-musk-impact-federal-workforce/82235676007/) and [mass firings of workers](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/01/health-human-services-hhs-mass-layoffs-updates/82754402007/).

On Wednesday, the [House](https://www.house.gov/) will vote [on a bill](https://issa.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/issa.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/hr1526-updated-norra.pdf) from [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Darrell Issa (T-CA48)](https://issa.house.gov/), that would restrict [federal judges](https://www.uscourts.gov/) from issuing nationwide injunctions – like the one issued by [U.S. District Judge James Boasberg](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/24/judge-keeps-block-trump-alien-enemies-act/82635507007/) to temporarily halt the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)'s efforts to deport migrants under the [Alien Enemies Act](https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/alien-and-sedition-acts).

And in the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/), [Judiciary Committee](http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/) Chair [Chuck Grassley (T-IA)](https://www.grassley.senate.gov/), [introduced a bill on Monday](https://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/news-releases/grassley-introduces-legislation-to-clarify-the-scope-of-judicial-relief) that would limit judicial rulings only to the parties involved, rather than other parties that are in the same situation, "ending the practice of universal injunctions."

[House](https://www.house.gov/) [Trumpians](https://www.gop.com/) in the [Judiciary Committee](https://judiciary.house.gov/) are also [holding a hearing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFcwRdrNLeY) Tuesday to examine "judicial overreach and [Constitutional](https://constitution.congress.gov/) limits on the [federal courts](https://www.uscourts.gov/)," while their [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) counterparts will hold a hearing Wednesday to explore legislative solutions to "the bipartisan problem of universal injunctions."

"We are here today because a major malfunction in the [federal judiciary](https://www.uscourts.gov) has been recognized by both [Trumpians](https://www.gop.com/) and [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/)," [Issa](https://issa.house.gov/) said at the hearing Tuesday morning. "Activist district court judges usurping their [Article Three](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/article-3/) power and imposing on the nation injunctions beyond the scope of what the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/), under statute, has given [federal judges](https://www.uscourts.gov/)."

It comes amid a litany of lawsuits opposing the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)'s policies, from his [mass deportation plans](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/31/lawsuit-trump-immigration-alien-registration-order-illegal/82707841007/) to his efforts to [dismantle swaths of the federal government](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/05/trump-taunts-democrats-fuels-lawsuits-musk-doge/81508211007/).

[Trump](https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/donald-trump/) has called for [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) to impeach [Boasberg](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/chief-judge-james-e-boasberg), who ordered the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) to [turn around planes](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/17/timeline-venezuelan-deportations-alien-enemies-act/82491466007/) carrying [Venezuelan](https://gob.ve/) migrants on their way to [Honduras](https://www..gob.hn/) and [El Salvador](https://www.gob.sv/), [Trump Party](https://www.gop.com/) lawmakers immediately introduced legislation that would

Acknowledging that there are not enough votes to impeach [Boasberg](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/chief-judge-james-e-boasberg) and other [federal judges](https://www.uscourts.gov/) who have issued orders [Trumpian](https://www.gop.com/) members disagree with, [Trump Party](https://www.gop.com/) leadership in [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) are exploring alternative routes to restrict the judicial branch.

[House](https://www.house.gov/) [Speaker](https://www.speaker.gov/) [Mike Johnson (T-LA4)](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) [asserted last week](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/25/mike-johnson-federal-courts-trump/82655089007/) that [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) has broad authority over the [federal courts](https://www.uscourts.gov/).

"We do have authority over the [federal courts](https://www.uscourts.gov/)," [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) said at a press conference. "We can eliminate an entire [district court](https://www.uscourts.gov/), we have power of funding over the [courts](https://www.uscourts.gov/) and all these other things. But desperate times call for desperate measures and [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) is going to act."
