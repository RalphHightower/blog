## [Why Trump’s offensive against the Federal Reserve and Jerome Powell matters](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-federal-reserve-jerome-powell-independence-rcna201892)

*The president's campaign against the Federal Reserve and Chairman Jerome Powell could have a direct impact on Americans' wallets.*

[Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has long struggled with the basics of economic policy, but there’s one detail the [president]() seems to understand fairly well: When the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) lowers interest rates, it helps accelerate the economy, and when the Fed raises rates, it pumps the economic brakes.

With this in mind, the Republican has spent the last decade [making knee-jerk pronouncements](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-going-handpicked-federal-reserve-chairman-rcna136992) about the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) that have stuck to a predictable pattern: [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has publicly lobbied for higher interest rates when he thought it would benefit his political interest, just as he’s publicly lobbied for lower interest rates when he thought they would also advance his ambitions.

It’s never been about what would help Americans; [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s priority related to the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) [has long been about helping](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-going-handpicked-federal-reserve-chairman-rcna136992).

With this in mind, since the [president]()’s second term began, he’s repeatedly and publicly pressed [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) [Chairman Jerome Powell]() — a [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) first-term nominee — to lower interest rates. [Powell](), mindful of stubborn inflation rates and the obvious fact that a rate cut would likely make inflation worse, has ignored the wildly inappropriate pressure campaign.

As [The New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/17/business/economy/trump-jerome-powell-fed.html), this has apparently inspired the president to kick things up a notch.

> *President [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) on Thursday escalated his long-running attack on the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/), by lashing out repeatedly at the head of the [nation’s central bank](), [Jerome H. Powell](), for not doing enough to fortify the economy as the effects of tariffs take hold. ... In an early morning social media post that ricocheted around Washington, Wall Street and beyond, [Mr. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) reprised those attacks, saying: ‘Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!’*

Hours after publishing that provocative missive, the [president]() seemed to endorse a weird conspiracy theory about his own handpicked [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) chair — he suggested Powell was refusing to lower rates [for “political” reasons](https://x.com/Acyn/status/1912929943996248400), which didn’t make sense — before bragging about his power to fire the “[terrible](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3lmzovt4iwv22)” chairman.

“If I want him out, he’ll be out of there real fast, believe me,” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) told reporters.

There’s no shortage of problems with this ridiculous campaign, starting with the fact that in modern American history, no other [president]() has even come close to using [heavy-handed tactics](https://politicalwire.com/2025/03/19/trump-calls-on-fed-to-cut-rates/) like these against the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/). What’s more, that the [president]() appears so desperate for a rate cut looks like an implicit admission that his tariffs agenda is failing to create the economic “boom” he was hoping for.

Just as importantly, if not more so, is the inconvenient fact that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [can’t legally fire Powell without cause](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/17/trump-fire-jerome-powell-fed-humphreys-executor), even as the [president]() suggests otherwise. If he were to try to take such a step, it would face immediate pushback in the [courts](https://www.uscourts.gov/), while simultaneously adding a fresh round of chaos and uncertainty to the markets.

But in case this weren’t quite enough, let’s also not lose sight of the fact that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) seems increasingly desperate to break down the wall dividing the [Oval Office]() from [Powell]()’s office. The [Economic Security Project]()’s [Chris Hughes]() wrote [an op-ed for The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/opinion/federal-reserve-powell-trump.html) about the significance of the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/)’s independence.

“If [Mr. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) succeeds in subjugating the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/), the consequences would extend far beyond his term in office,” [Hughes]() wrote. “Interest rates would fluctuate with election cycles rather than economic conditions. Inflation expectations would become unanchored, creating the potential for prices to spiral out of control. The dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency — which gives [America]() enormous economic advantages — would be jeopardized.

“And beyond the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/), [Mr. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s assault on institutional independence would threaten a tradition that has been essential to [America]()’s success. ... By undermining these principles, [Mr. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) isn’t making [America]() great. He’s dismantling the institutional architecture that made [American]() prosperity possible in the first place.”
