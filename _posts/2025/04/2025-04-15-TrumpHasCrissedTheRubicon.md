## [Trump is using Kilmar Abrego Garcia to send the Supreme Court a message](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/abrego-garcia-supreme-court-ruling-trump-newsletter-rcna201303)

*The unconscionable position is now the official position of the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/).*

April 15, 2025, 2:10 PM EDT
By Charlie Sykes, MSNBC columnist
[Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) just sent the [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) an unambiguous message: You made your ruling. Now enforce it, because I‚Äôm not going to. That constitutional crisis we‚Äôve expected, yet feared? It‚Äôs here.

On Monday, both [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) officials and the [president](https://www.presidencia.gob.sv/) of [El Salvador](https://www.gob.sv/) said they could not return Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a [Maryland](https://www.maryland.gov/) man who was wrongfully deported and sent to a notorious prison in [El Salvador](https://www.gob.sv/).

‚ÄúOf course, I‚Äôm not going to do it,‚Äù [El Salvador](https://www.gob.sv/) [President Nayib Bukele](https://www.presidencia.gob.sv/) said when he was asked whether he would return Garcia. At his side, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) sat smirking. [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi]() joined in the cruel pantomime: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs up for [El Salvador](https://www.gob.sv/) if they want to return him.‚Äù

> And just like that, the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) openly defied a unanimous ruling by the nation‚Äôs highest court.

Last week, by a vote of 9-0[^27], the [court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) instructed the government to ‚Äúfacilitate‚Äù the return of Abrego Garcia. But the justices left [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) just enough wiggle room to scoff at making effort at all, despite multiple rulings from [federal courts](https://www.uscourts.gov%), including a district court judge who [called Abrego Garcia‚Äôs arrest](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)-asks-scotus-block-order-return-man-mistakenly-dep-rcna199979) ‚Äúwholly lawless.‚Äù

[^27]: @RalphHightower: This is probably the first unanimous verdict in our nation‚Äôs history. 

[U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis of Maryland wrote:](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mdd.578815/gov.uscourts.mdd.578815.31.0.pdf):

Defendants seized Abrego Garcia without any lawful authority; held him in three separate domestic detention centers without legal basis; failed to present him to any immigration judge or officer; and forcibly transported him to [El Salvador](https://www.gob.sv/) in direct contravention of the INA. Once there, U.S. officials secured his detention in a facility that, by design, deprives its detainees of adequate food, water, and shelter, fosters routine violence; and places him with his persecutors.

On Sunday, the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) claimed that the federal courts lacked any jurisdiction in the case. The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) made this argument even though it was already rejected unanimously last week by a federal appeals court. ‚ÄúThe [United States Government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has no legal authority to snatch a person who is lawfully present in the [United States Government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) off the street and remove him from the country without due process,‚Äù the judges from the [4th Circuit](https://www.mdd.uscourts.gov/) wrote. ‚ÄúThe Government‚Äôs contention otherwise, and its argument that the federal courts are powerless to intervene are unconscionable.‚Äù

But the ‚Äúunconscionable‚Äù position is now the official position of the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/), and [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is now daring the nation‚Äôs highest court to do something about it.
