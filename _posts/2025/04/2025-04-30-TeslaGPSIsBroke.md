## [Experts sound alarm on Elon Musk's misguided Tesla plan](https://www.thestreet.com/technology/experts-sound-alarm-on-elon-musks-misguided-tesla-plan-)

Story by Samuel O'Brient • April 26, 2025

[Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) (TSLA) has been facing an increasing number of challenges since 2025 began. Between the ongoing threat posed by the trade war and the anti-brand sentiment sparked by [Elon Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)’s political affiliations, it has proven increasingly difficult for TSLA stock to garner sustainable momentum.

On April 22, [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) reported Q1 earnings as both investors and consumers tuned in early to learn about [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)’s plans for the company’s future. The decision to focus on his Capitol Hill responsibilities rather than his companies has generated concern among even bullish analysts.

On the call, [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) issued vague statements about his plans to scale back his work with the so-called [Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)](https://www.doge.gov/) and return to [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/). While TSLA stock has responded well to the news, victory celebrations may be premature.

The company is still facing a long road to recovery, as evidenced by a new growth plan that many experts believe is ill-advised.

### [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) is trying to pull off something that experts think can’t be done

While much of the recent focus on [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) has been on its 71% profit decline and 20% drop in automotive revenue, the [company](https://www.tesla.com/) is also facing another key problem some investors may not be accounting for: its failure to effectively sell the [Cybertruck](https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck).

Some photos published by [Sherwood News](https://sherwood.news/) recently showed a massive pileup of unsold [Cybertrucks](https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck) near [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)’s facility in Austin, Texas. Other reports have revealed parking lots with similar buildup in locations such as Overland Park, Kansas.

Reports indicate that since the [Cybertruck](https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck)’s release, an event preceded by years of hype, [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) has delivered less than 50,000 to date. While some have speculated that its lack of popularity could be due to anti-[Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) backlash, a look back shows that the [Cybertruck](https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck) pileup did not begin recently enough for that to be the only factor.

The clear takeaway from this trend is that demand for [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) [Cybertrucks](https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck) isn’t keeping pace with supply. In response, [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) has been quietly working on a solution that doesn’t seem to be working so far: rebranding the [Cybertruck](https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck) as the vehicle of the American working man.

According to [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/), [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) wants its highly futuristic-looking vehicle to be seen as “less DeLorean, more [Ford F-150](https://www.ford.com/trucks/f150/2024/).” But from the perspective of many experts, this idea is misguided and has little chance of success.

Electric vehicle (EV) industry veteran [Joseph Nagle](https://www.pandoelectric.com/about-us), who serves as Head of Corporate Strategy at [Pando Electric](https://www.pandoelectric.com/), spoke to [TheStreet](https://www.thestreet.com/) about the reasons [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)’s [Cybertruck](https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck) rebrand is likely to fail.

“On any job site, there is a near-religious attachment to different truck brands,” he states, reflecting on his background in the construction industry. “Very simply, it's not a truck for the working man. It doesn't feel like the tank that is the F-150. Those feel like they can take a beating and still keep going. The [Cybertruck](https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck) feels like a prop from a TV show.”

[Nagle](https://www.pandoelectric.com/about-us) adds that the [Cybertruck](https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck) is unlikely to ever be seen as a vehicle for the typical working man. While he acknowledges [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) may be able to sell the truck to younger consumers, he notes that they may not be able to afford it for some time, given the vehicle’s high price tag.

### [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) has a clear [Cybertruck](https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck) demand problem

Other leaders at the intersection of the automotive and technology sectors have takes similar to [Nagle](https://www.pandoelectric.com/about-us)'s. Alex Black, Chief Marketing Officer at vehicle registry [EpicVIN](https://epicvin.com/), shared with [TheStreet](https://www.thestreet.com/) that he believes [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)’s decision says a lot about its [Cybertruck](https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck) demand problem.

“Labeling the [Cybertruck](https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck) a 'working man’s truck' reads more like a marketing ploy than a reflection of actual change,” he argues. “Most contractors or tradesmen aren’t spending $80K+ on a truck with yoke steering and a stainless steel exoskeleton that will scratch just by breathing on it the wrong way.”

In Black’s view, the consumer demographic that typically purchases a pickup truck is unlikely to ever embrace the [Cybertruck](https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck), as these people tend to “prioritize utilitarian usefulness and reliability” over visual aesthetics.

[Matt Voda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-voda/), CEO of [OptiMine Software](https://optimine.com/), echoes [Nagle](https://www.pandoelectric.com/about-us)’s argument that truck buyers may be too loyal to their brand of choice — be it [Ford](https://www.ford.com/), [Chevrolet](https://www.chevrolet.com/), or [Dodge](https://www.dodge.com/) — to switch. “Most truck buyers are extremely brand loyal, so it is even more difficult to get a truck buyer to switch brands at some point in their lives,” he notes.

[Voda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-voda/) also claims that [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) has invested [almost no money](https://segmentify.com/blog/tesla-marketing-strategy/#:~:text=[Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)%20doesn't%20do%20marketing,us%20to%20our%20next%20question:) in marketing over the past decade, which he sees as putting the company at a chronic disadvantage when it comes to competing with established truck makers.
