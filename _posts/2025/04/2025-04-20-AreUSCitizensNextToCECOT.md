## [Republican Repeatedly Dodges Question on Deporting US Citizen Criminals](https://www.newsweek.com/tom-emmer-repeatedly-dodges-question-deporting-us-citizen-criminals-2061906)

Story by Mandy Taheri. April 20, 2025.

[House](https://www.house.gov/) [Majority Whip](https://www.majoritywhip.gov/) [Tom Emmer (T-MN)](https://emmer.house.gov/) sidestepped repeated questions from [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/) host [Dana Bash](https://www.cnn.com/profiles/dana-bash-profile) on Sunday about whether or not he supports [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s floated proposal to expand deportations to [El Salvador](https://www.gob.sv/) to include U.S. citizens with violent criminal records.

Newsweek has reached out to [Emmer](https://emmer.house.gov/)'s press team for comment via email on Sunday.

### Why It Matters

During a recent [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) meeting between [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and [Salvadoran](https://www.gob.sv/) [President Nayib Bukele](https://www.presidencia.gob.sv/), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) mentioned the possibility of [sending U.S. citizens who commit violent crimes to the Central American country.](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-floats-deporting-americans-el-salvador-absolute-monsters-2059711).

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and [Bukele](https://www.presidencia.gob.sv/) brokered a $6 million deal for [El Salvador](https://www.gob.sv/) to detain about 300 migrants, including alleged gang members, at the country's maximum-security prison, CECOT, for one year.

Earlier this year, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) sent two planes full of migrants that he claimed were gang members to the mega prison despite a court's order to halt deportations. In addition, [Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia](https://www.newsweek.com/maryland-man-abrego-garcia-could-deported-another-country-doj-says-2060181), who came to the U.S. illegally and resided in [Maryland](https://www.maryland.gov/) with his wife and children, was aboard the flight in what the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) later called an "administrative error." He remains in [El Salvador](https://www.gob.sv/) despite a court order urging the federal government to "facilitate" his return.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) campaigned on a hardline immigration stance, pledging to carry out the largest mass deportation in U.S. history. In the initial months of [his presidency](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), [his administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has [deported around 100,000 illegal immigrants](https://www.newsweek.com/mass-deportation-update-illegal-immigration-trump-administration-2053905), many due to his invocation of the [Alien Enemies Act of 1798](https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/alien-and-sedition-acts), which grants the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) authority to deport non-citizens without appearing before a judge, among other wartime authorities.

Many legal experts and [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) have expressed outrage and concern about the [presidential authority](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), lack of due process, and the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)'s sidestepping of various court orders. [Emmer](https://emmer.house.gov/), a top [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Trumpian](https://www.gop.com/) who is also an attorney, has been supportive of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s sweeping efforts, but on Sunday avoided answering [Bash](https://www.cnn.com/profiles/dana-bash-profile)'s question regarding the fate of some U.S. citizens with violent criminal records.

### What To Know

In a Sunday morning interview on [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/)'s [State of the Union](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/20/politics/video/sotu-majority-whip-emmer-defends-trump-handling-of-brego-garcia-deportation-case), [Bash](https://www.cnn.com/profiles/dana-bash-profile) pressed [Emmer](https://emmer.house.gov/) on [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s remarks about deporting U.S. citizens convicted of violent crimes to [El Salvador](https://www.gob.sv/), asking, "Do you think the federal government has any legal authority to do that with American citizens?"

"I think right now what he is doing is absolutely legal, which is removing those that do not have legal status in this country that have proven to be the worst of worst—" the congressman responded, with [Bash](https://www.cnn.com/profiles/dana-bash-profile) jumping in, "But what about U.S. citizens?"

[Emmer](https://emmer.house.gov/) continued to talk about the state of illegal immigration and [Senator](https://www.senate.gov/) [Chris Van Hollen (D-MD)](https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/) [recently went to visit Abrego Garcia in El Salvador](https://www.newsweek.com/democratic-senator-says-he-met-kilmar-abrego-garcia-what-we-know-2061325) with regards for his sympathy for "illegal immigrants."

"[Congressman](https://emmer.house.gov/), my question is about U.S. citizens," [Bash](https://www.cnn.com/profiles/dana-bash-profile) reiterated, adding, "What about the idea that the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) says it is looking into whether or not U.S. citizens who are convicted of violent crimes can be imprisoned in [El Salvador](https://www.gob.sv/)?"

The [Minnesota](https://www.mn.gov/) [Trumpian](https://www.gop.com/) responded: "Well, again, what they're focused on...is what's actually happening, which is deporting terrorist, cartel members, rapists, murders the worst of the worst is exactly what Donald [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) promised during the campaign."

In a final offer, [Bash](https://www.cnn.com/profiles/dana-bash-profile) said, "I just want to give you one more chance to say whether or not you're okay with U.S. citizens, the idea of it, I know it's not happening [right now], but he has actively said more than once that they are looking into it, would you be okay with it?"

He responded by not answering the question but instead turning it on party lines, saying "We got a [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) who wants to protect U.S. citizens from violence, from crime, having their children solicited, murdered, et cetera versus [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) who seem to want to protect illegal aliens in this country for whatever reason."

The interview ended without [Emmer](https://emmer.house.gov/) stating if he would support [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s proposal regarding U.S citizens. Earlier this week following the meeting between [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and [Bukele](https://www.presidencia.gob.sv/), he backed [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s broader immigration stance, posting on [X](https://x.com/), formerly [Twitter](https://twitter.com/): "[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) says he wants to deport as many illegal criminals as possible to [El Salvador](https://www.gob.sv/). [Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) and Border Czar Harris allowed murderers, rapists, and vicious gang members to flood into our country unvetted. Now, [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) @realDonald[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is going to clean up the mess the [Biden Administration](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) made!"

During the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) meeting, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) specifically referenced targeting U.S. citizens who commit violent crimes: "We always have to obey the laws, but we also have homegrown criminals that push people into subways, that hit elderly ladies on the back of the head with a baseball bat when they're not looking, that are absolute monsters. I'd like to include them."

He also reportedly told the [Salvadorian](https://www.gob.sv/) [president](https://www.presidencia.gob.sv/), "The homegrowns are next, the homegrowns. You've got to build about five more places," presumably in reference to prison space, with [Bukele](https://www.presidencia.gob.sv/) responding "yeah, we've got space," according to [NPR](https://www.npr.org/).

The legal viability of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s potential plan is extremely unclear, with [David Bier](https://www.cato.org/people/david-bier), the director of immigration studies at the think tank [Cato Institute](https://www.cato.org/), recently telling [NPR](https://www.npr.org/): "It's obviously unconstitutional, obviously illegal. There's no authority in any U.S. law to deport U.S. citizens and certainly not to imprison them in a foreign country."

### What People Are Saying

[White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) press secretary Karoline Leavitt previously said that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was interested in deporting "heinous, violent criminals" who are U.S. citizens to [El Salvador](https://www.gob.sv/) "if there's a legal pathway to do that."

Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the [American Immigration Council](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/), posted to [X](https://x.com/) on Monday: "We are at a dangerous, dangerous moment in US history, where the [President of the United States](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is threatening to send US citizens to be imprisoned by a foreign ally, and the foreign ally is saying it won't respect an [sic] US court orders to release people that it's holding."

[Senator](https://www.senate.gov/) [Chris Van Hollen (D-MD)](https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/) wrote in a Friday X post about Abrego Garcia's case: "We are standing up for EVERYONE's right to due process under the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/)."

The [Lincoln Project](https://lincolnproject.us/), the anti-[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)[^67] group, wrote in an [X](https://x.com/) statement on April 14: "[Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is deporting legal US residents to a foreign gulag, and he has stated publicly that he is moving on to citizens next. This is a [Constitutional](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/) crisis. Will a single [Trumpian](https://www.gop.com/) stand up for our [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/)?"

[^67]: @RalphHightower: I'll allow Republican in this use since they are anti-[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)

[Salvadoran](https://www.gob.sv/) [President Nayib Bukele](https://www.presidencia.gob.sv/) wrote in a February [X](https://x.com/) post: "We have offered the [United States of America](https://www.usa.gov/) the opportunity to outsource part of its prison system. We are willing to take in only convicted criminals (including convicted U.S. citizens) into our mega-prison (CECOT) in exchange for a fee."

### What Happens Next?

It is unclear under what legal authority the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) could execute this idea.

Deportations are expected to continue under the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) despite several legal challenges and orders halting specific cases.
