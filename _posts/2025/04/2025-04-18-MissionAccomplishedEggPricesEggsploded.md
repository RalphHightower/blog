## [Trump picking a fight over egg prices wasn‚Äôt a good idea after all](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-picking-fight-egg-prices-wasnt-good-idea-rcna200828)

*After the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) spent weeks claiming that he succeeded in lowering the price of eggs, egg prices actually reached record highs.*

By Steve Benen

In early March, when [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) delivered a national address before a joint session of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/), the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) covered a lot of ground, though he seemed especially animated on a specific topic.

‚Äú[Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) especially let the price of eggs get out of control,‚Äù [the president declared](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/us/politics/transcript-trump-speech-congress.html). ‚ÄúThe egg prices, out of control.‚Äù

The rhetoric was [plainly absurd](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-house-pushes-self-defeating-line-price-eggs-rcna194971), since egg prices spiked in response to a [bird flu outbreak](https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/index.html), and [presidents](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) can‚Äôt simply snap their fingers[^23] and undo the effects of [H5N1](https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/index.html). [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) nevertheless created an unfortunate and ill-advised standard: The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), the [the Republican effectively told the nation](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-house-pushes-self-defeating-line-price-eggs-rcna194971), is responsible for what American consumers pay for eggs, and it‚Äôs up to the incumbent president not to ‚Äúlet the price of eggs get out of control.‚Äù

In the weeks that followed, he kept going. On March 20, [Trump claimed](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114198370343993836) that he‚Äôd brought egg prices ‚ÄúWAY DOWN.‚Äù Last week, [he echoed the boast](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114280322706682564).

If the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) was gambling that Americans would reward him for lowering the price of eggs, it was a very bad bet ‚Äî because [as The New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/us/politics/egg-prices-march.html), egg prices have reached record highs.

> *For weeks, [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has repeatedly boasted that his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) had managed to bring egg prices down. But new data on Thursday showed that egg prices at the grocery store continued to climb in March. Egg prices rose 5.9 percent over the month, according to data released by the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov%). They climbed at a slower rate, though, after rising 10.4 percent in February and 15.2 percent in January. Compared with a year earlier, egg prices were up 60.4 percent.*

Wholesale egg prices have come down, but retail prices ‚Äî what American consumers actually pay at grocery stores ‚Äî have [climbed in recent months](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/APU0000708111).

The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), in other words, has not brought egg prices ‚ÄúWAY DOWN,‚Äù and if he thought picking this fight would work to his advantage, he apparently thought wrong.

As for the larger context, I‚Äôm reminded of comments [Barack Obama](obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) [made last week](https://barackobama.medium.com/conversation-at-hamilton-college-0c44228ac0bd) during an appearance at [Hamilton College](https://www.hamilton.edu/). The former [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) said, ‚ÄúI think this is one of the challenges that we have ‚Äî and I saw this even before the last election. I think people tend to think, ‚ÄòOh, [democracy, rule of law, independent judiciary, freedom of the press](https://constitution.congress.gov/). That‚Äôs all abstract stuff because it‚Äôs not affecting the price of eggs.‚Äù Well, you know what? It‚Äôs about to affect the price of eggs.‚Äù
