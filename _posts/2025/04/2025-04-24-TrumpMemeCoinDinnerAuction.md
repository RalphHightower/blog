## [Trump extends rare White House opportunity to those who buy his meme coin](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-extends-rare-white-house-opportunity-buy-meme-coin-rcna202855)

*An official who oversaw crypto policy for the [SEC](https://www.sec.gov/) said of [Team Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s latest gambit, “They are making the pay-to-play deal explicit.”*

April 24, 2025, 2:17 PM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

As [Donald Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/donald-trump)’s second term got underway, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) made clear that he [intended to profit](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/early-evidence-suggests-trump-will-keep-grifts-going-white-house-rcna188735) — or at least try to profit — from cryptocurrencies, creating unprecedented ethical controversies. As the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) approaches his 100-day mark, the morass is vastly worse. [The New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/technology/trump-private-dinner-crypto-memecoin.html):

> *The flashy online announcement called it “the most EXCLUSIVE INVITATION in the World,” a chance to have “an intimate private dinner” with [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) at his [members-only golf club in Virginia](https://www.trumpnationaldc.com/), followed by a tour of the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). A seat would be reserved for each of the top 220 investors in [TRUMP](https://gettrumpmemes.com/), a cryptocurrency that [Mr. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) launched on the eve of his inauguration. ... “Have Dinner with [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and the [$TRUMP](https://gettrumpmemes.com/) Community!” the invitation said. “Let the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) know how many [TRUMP](https://gettrumpmemes.com/) coins YOU own!”*

What we’re dealing with is a relatively straightforward proposition: A website promoting one of the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s crypto offerings announced that those who purchased his meme coin would have a chance to dine with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and get a [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) tour.

[The Times](https://www.nytimes.com/)’ report described this as “an astonishing escalation of the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [family](https://www.trump.com/)’s efforts to profit from crypto,” adding that, for all intents and purposes, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s business partners were offering [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and [presidential access](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) “in exchange for an investment” in one of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s ventures.

Corey Frayer, who oversaw crypto policy for the [Securities and Exchange Commission](https://www.sec.gov/) during the [Biden administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/), told the Times, “This is really incredible. They are making the pay-to-play deal explicit.”

The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [declined to comment](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/23/trump-presidency-news/#link-KHM3CEMRFJAK7HWYA4XAXT4LQY), which made sense, given that it’d be awfully difficult to come up with some kind of defense for this.

In case anyone needs [a refresher](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/early-evidence-suggests-trump-will-keep-grifts-going-white-house-rcna188735) as to how we arrived at this point, the trouble began in earnest in January. With just three days remaining before his presidential inauguration, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) found time to launch [one last post-election grift](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-was-time-one-last-pre-inaugural-grift-rcna188375): Without explanation or defense, the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) and his family started selling [a cryptocurrency token](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/18/us/politics/trump-meme-coin-crypto.html). (Two days later, first lady [Melania Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) apparently got in on the game, [launching a “coin” of her own](https://www.axios.com/2025/01/19/melania-trump-meme-coin-crypto).)

While the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s many merchandising opportunities have been [difficult to keep up](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/even-election-trump-still-selling-lot-stuff-rcna183411), this latest endeavor was arguably the most outrageous — in part because of the [rather obvious conflict of interest](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/17/us/politics/trump-conflicts-of-interest.html) related to the [Securities and Exchange Commission](https://www.sec.gov/) and in part because of the brazenness of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s profiteering.

The [Campaign Legal Center](https://campaignlegal.org/)’s [Adav Noti](https://campaignlegal.org/staff/adav-noti) [explained soon after](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/18/us/politics/trump-meme-coin-crypto.html), “It is literally cashing in on the [presidency](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) — creating a financial instrument so people can transfer money to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s [family](https://www.trump.com/) in connection with his office. It is beyond unprecedented.”

What was to stop a foreign government, eager to bribe the American [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), from quietly dumping money into [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s crypto project, effectively making direct payments to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) without public disclosure? Nothing.

The day after being sworn into office, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) continued to use his social media platform [to promote his controversial meme coin](https://x.com/yashar/status/1881895033017626664). In the weeks that followed, his efforts continued. In late January, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [wrote online,](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/113925824938962217), “I LOVE [$TRUMP](https://gettrumpmemes.com/)!!” In March, adopting the writing style of a tween, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) published [a follow-up item](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114212473050636851) that read, “I LOVE [$TRUMP](https://gettrumpmemes.com/) — SO COOL!!! The Greatest of them all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”

The brazenness, however, continues to reach new depths.

As [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Chris Murphy](https://www.murphy.senate.gov/) of [Connecticut](https://portal.ct.gov/) [recently noted](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-turns-white-house-lawn-car-lot-megadonor-musk-rcna196000) in an unrelated matter, “Just because the corruption plays out in public doesn’t mean it’s not corruption.”
