## [Tesla’s stock is set for a ‘death cross’ on Monday: 3 reasons why it’s a risky buy](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/teslas-stock-is-set-for-a-death-cross-on-monday-3-reasons-why-its-a-risky-buy-eec03334?)

Story by Laila Maidan. April 12. 2025

[Tesla Inc.](https://www.tesla.com/) investors need to ask themselves: How do you price in sentiment?

Chief Executive [Elon Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)’s involvement in Washington and his leadership role in the so-called [Department of Governmental Efficiency (DOGE)](https://www.doge.gov/), have been driving the narrative lately on [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)’s stock — for better or worse.

The stock rallied in the final quarter of 2024, running up by 120% between late October and mid-December, partly on a strong sales outlook and partly because of [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)’s closeness to [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). Investors hoped his ties to the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) would be positive for [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/).

Now, though, those ties have become a liability for the electric-vehicle maker. People are vandalizing [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) dealerships, charging stations and cars driven by its customers. Even those who aren’t actively boycotting the brand may be deterred from owning a [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) right now. 

The [company](https://www.tesla.com/) is heavily consumer-facing. About 77% of its revenue comes from consumer vehicles, and [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) also sells energy products to consumers. So brand sentiment and its impact on sales matters. The truth is, very few high-profile brands have seen backlash and political boycotts to the degree [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) is now experiencing.

Bud Light serves as one example, but to a lesser extent. Following an April 2023 boycott of Bud Light, [Anheuser-Busch InBev SA](https://www.ab-inbev.com/)’s stock tumbled by about 16% in a little over a month. [Sales for Bud Light haven’t recovered](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/budweisers-parent-company-is-selling-less-beer-and-making-more-money-b84c8fec?mod=article_inline). So gauging the fallout from backlash against [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) ahead of its future earnings could be difficult.

[Bob Lang](https://explosiveoptions.net/meet-bob-lang/), founder and chief strategist at [Explosive Option](shttps://explosiveoptions.net/), suggests turning to soft data to try and determine how consumers feel about the brand. A survey by [YouGov](https://today.yougov.com/(popup:search/tesla;after=2025-03-11;period=month;type=surveys)) from March showed that 37% of respondents said that [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) is either part of or wholly the reason they wouldn’t consider owning or leasing a [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/).

What does the data tell us about [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)’s stock?

### Its technicals look rough

If you’re a trader, you could probably resort to an endless number of indicators to gauge short term moves. But for longer-term investors, the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages matter because they show long-term trends. 

As of Friday morning, [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) was near the “death cross”, which is when the 50-day moving average falls below the 200-day moving average, a bearish signal. 

“Why is that significant? It means that big institutional money is going to think twice about buying below this after the crossover is done,” Lang said.

Below is a chart from [FactSet](https://www.factset.com/) that shows the near cross of the 50-day moving average to the 200-day moving average as of Friday’s close. At current rates, the 50-day can cross over the 200-day on Monday.

### How are valuations looking?

Valuing [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) isn’t only difficult because of negative brand sentiment. The [company](https://www.tesla.com/) is also kind of in a league of its own. In other words, comparing it to other automakers is a big mistake, said Garrett Nelson, vice president of equity research at [CFRA](https://www.cfraresearch.com/). The stock trades more like a tech name than an auto one, meaning that its price-to-earnings ratio is elevated.

[Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) is currently trading at a forward P/E ratio of 85.1. In contrast, Ford trades at a forward P/E of just 7, based on 12-month consensus estimates of analysts polled by [FactSet](https://www.factset.com/).

Investors justify a higher P/E for companies that are big growers, but Lang questions whether [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) is deserving of such a large multiple if it isn’t making large strides in revenue growth for its automotive sales.

“It’s quite risky for an investor to be in [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) right here, even as the stock has fallen some 40%,” Lang said.

Perhaps we can step back further and compare [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) to the S&P 500 A March report from [Research Affiliates](https://www.researchaffiliates.com/home) ’s [Rob Arnott](https://www.researchaffiliates.com/about-us/our-team/rob-arnott) breaks down how investors who bet on EV specialists, including [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/), fared relative to the benchmark index. It shows a slight outperformance for [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) toward the end of 2024, with a much choppier ride along the way.

The chart below from [Research Affiliates](https://www.researchaffiliates.com/home) shows the S&P 500 benchmarked at $1, while EV companies start at $1 and move relative to their percentage gain or loss from the S&P 500’s price.

### What about the fundamentals?

[Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) isn’t starting off the year on solid footing. In January, it reported that fourth-quarter revenue from auto sales was down by 8% from a year earlier. It went from having a massive 80% share of the U.S. EV market in 2020 to a 49% share in 2024, according to data from Kelley Blue Book compiled by CFRA.

In North America, its competition comes from traditional automakers with EV offerings. Nelson believes one reason [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) lost market share is that it hasn’t introduced new models other than the [Cybertruck](https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck) since the first deliveries of the [Model Y](https://www.tesla.com/modely) five years ago.

[China](https://www.cn.gov/) is another big market for [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/), and the company generates about 21% of its revenue there. However, revenue from that part of the market was down by 4.9% from a year ago, according to [FactSet](https://www.factset.com/) data. It’s a trend that could continue as tensions over trade wars muster up national sentiment and push more [Chinese](https://www.cn.gov/) consumers to opt for vehicles from its main [Chinese](https://www.cn.gov/) competitor, BYD Co. Ltd.

As for the impact from tariffs, this may be [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)’s one saving grace since the EV maker has most of its factories in the U.S. However, on Friday, [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/) reported that the ability to order the [Model S](https://www.tesla.com/models) sedan and [Model X SUV](https://www.tesla.com/modelx) in [China](https://www.cn.gov/) [was no longer an option on Tesla’s website](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2025/04/11/tesla-appears-to-stop-orders-for-american-made-cars-in-china-as-beijing-raises-us-tariffs/). Also on Friday, [China](https://www.cn.gov/) increased its tariffs on U.S. imports to 125%.

Seth Goldstein, a [Morningstar](https://.www.morningstar.com/) strategist, told MarketWatch that [Chinese](https://www.cn.gov/) sales of the [Model S](https://www.tesla.com/models) and [X](https://www.tesla.com/) are a small part of [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)’s total business, so he doesn’t expect a big impact on revenue.

Goldstein is more concerned about [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)’s energy-generation and storage businesses, which rely on [Chinese](https://www.cn.gov/) battery cells. The [company](https://www.tesla.com/) may need to raise prices on batteries for its energy storage system, making them less competitive, he noted.

### The positives

Now that we’ve pounded out the risks, there are three arguments in favor of [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)’s stock. The first is that the stock’s price has been beaten down so much that its cheapness has created a margin of safety for investors who want to buy now.

Sell-side price targets, which have been steep, are still bullish because the stock is trading below analysts’ updated levels. For example, analysts polled by [FactSet](https://www.factset.com/) have a mean price target of $342. More than half of analyst tracked by [FactSet](https://www.factset.com/) remain bullish at 29 out of 56 analysts. [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)’s stock was trading near $252 at Friday’s close.

Plus: The [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) is now an emerging market. Invest accordingly.

[Morningstar](https://.www.morningstar.com/)’s fair value, which takes into consideration fundamentals, uncertainty, and volatility is $250.

The second thing to note is that sentiment can quickly shift. Nelson noted that a Politico article on April 2, about [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) leaving [DOGE](https://www.doge.gov/), sent the stock rallying in the days that followed, despite a disappointing sales report released that same day. While [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) said the report was untrue, the episode brings us to an important point about [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)’s stock, which is that sentiment is a key driver of its price.

Finally, [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) has growing strengths outside of its EV offerings. Its unique positioning in autonomous vehicles and robotics could mean it has a bright future in the world of artificial-intelligence development. Additionally, the energy generation and storage parts of its [business](https://www.tesla.com), while still small, are rapidly growing. As [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)’s automotive revenue fell by 6% last year, revenue from [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)’s energy sector grew by about 67%. Admittedly, energy only represents about 10% of [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)’s sales for now.
