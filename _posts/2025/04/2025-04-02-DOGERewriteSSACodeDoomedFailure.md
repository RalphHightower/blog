## [DOGE’s new plan to overhaul the Social Security Administration is doomed to fail](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/doge-social-security-plan-fail-code-rcna198866)

*Modernizing the [SSA](https://www.ssa.gov/)’s technical infrastructure is not a novel idea – and such modernizations have a poor track record.*

April 1, 2025, 2:09 PM EDT

By Waldo Jaquith, former government technologist

[Elon Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/) has turned his attention to the [Social Security Administration](https://www.ssa.gov/), the latest agency that his team of novice programmers has invaded for the apparent purpose of hobbling it. [Wired magazine reported last week](https://www.wired.com/story/doge-rebuild-social-security-administration-cobol-benefits/) that the [Department of Government Efficiency](https://www.doge.gov/) plans to replace the [mainframes](https://www.youtube.com/embed/ouAG4vXFORc?si=Jv0LsfZzeFZzmnTi) that power the agency’s mission and rebuild their functionality on new servers in a new programming language — with just a few months’ work.

> Critics complain that the COBOL programming language, widely in use in the [SSA](https://www.ssa.gov/), is old and outdated. This is wrong.

Assuming [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/doge-rebuild-social-security-administration-cobol-benefits/)’s reporting is accurate, we know that such an effort will surely fail. The track record of decades of modernizations of thousands of software systems, in both the private and public sectors, makes that clear. This isn’t even an interesting-yet-flawed idea. It’s a hackneyed, clichéd bad idea that could only sound compelling to novice software developers. It’s like cooking a Thanksgiving turkey in 20 minutes by putting it in a blast furnace, or choosing to get measles instead of getting vaccinated against it: it sounds most convincing to the layperson who asks the fewest questions.

Critics complain that the COBOL programming language, widely in use in the [SSA](https://www.ssa.gov/), is old and outdated. This is wrong.

Critics complain that the COBOL programming language, widely in use in the [SSA](https://www.ssa.gov/), is old and outdated. This is wrong. While COBOL’s origins date to 1959, it’s an actively maintained programming language, with an updated standard published by the [International Standards Organization](https://www.iso.org/) in 2023. The advanced age of actively maintained languages is evidence of their sustainability and quality. Many “modern” languages are quite old: C is 52 years old, Python is 34 years old, and even JavaScript will turn 30 this year. COBOL remains so widely used in our financial system that 95% of ATM transactions rely on it. There are 220 billion lines of COBOL in use today. Why? Mostly because it’s really good at processing large amounts of business data.

Critics also complain that [mainframes](https://www.youtube.com/embed/ouAG4vXFORc?si=Jv0LsfZzeFZzmnTi) are antiquated in an era of cloud computing. In fact, [mainframes](https://www.youtube.com/embed/ouAG4vXFORc?si=Jv0LsfZzeFZzmnTi) are still in wide use throughout the public and private sectors. They are not the room-sized reel-to-reel machines of the 1960s, but instead sleek, modern machines that would turn any developer’s head. They excel anywhere that it’s important to have lots of processing power, high redundancy and the ability to muscle through big batches of data processing—precisely what the [SSA](https://www.ssa.gov/) needs.

Modernizing the [SSA](https://www.ssa.gov/)’s technical infrastructure is not a novel idea. The agency has continuously modernized its systems since 1982, and [published a new digital modernization strategy just last year](https://www.ssa.gov/open/materials/DMS-narrative-2024.pdf). That’s because one-time modernizations, at best, succeed only for a brief time. Without ongoing modernization, the infrastructure quickly will become old again. Continuous modernization does not necessarily mean replacing COBOL or moving the whole system off [mainframes](https://www.youtube.com/embed/ouAG4vXFORc?si=Jv0LsfZzeFZzmnTi). It means identifying and prioritizing the most urgent needs of the system’s users and building whatever technical infrastructure is necessary to make that happen. It is entirely possible that COBOL on [mainframes](https://www.youtube.com/embed/ouAG4vXFORc?si=Jv0LsfZzeFZzmnTi) is the correct infrastructure for many of the needs of the [Social Security Administration](https://www.ssa.gov/).

The important thing about the existing [SSA](https://www.ssa.gov/) technical infrastructure is that it works! Those 70 million people get their $1.3 trillion in monthly payments, which allow them to pay their rent, buy food, afford medications and give birthday presents to their grandkids. [Commerce Secretary](https://www.commerce.gov/) [Howard Lutnick’s mother may not worry about getting her check](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/social-security-trump-cabinet-secretary-inadvertently-gives-away-game-rcna197743) — likely because her son is a billionaire — but to many of those 70 million people, their monthly check is all that’s keeping them housed, clothed and fed.

> What could be the legitimate purpose of this incredibly dangerous operation?

If [Twitter](https:x.com/) accidentally goes down for a few hours, nothing terrible happens. But if just one person misses a [Social Security](https;//www.ssa.gov/) payment, that could drop the person off a financial cliff. Replacing the [SSA](https://www.ssa.gov/)’s core infrastructure with an entirely new system all at once is performing a high-wire act without a net, only it’s not [DOGE](https://www.doge.gov/) staffers who risk falling — it’s the [Social Security](https;//www.ssa.gov/) beneficiaries who depend on that social safety net.

Complex systems theoretically reflect a complex set of documented rules — in this case, laws, regulations and policies — but, in practice, there are additional rules that are encoded only in the software, documented nowhere else. To the inexperienced software developer, it can seem self-evident that you can replace an old system with a new one by using the documented, but the experienced software developer knows that’s a trap.

Replacing COBOL is a special challenge, for a reason generally known only to experienced COBOL developers: [math works differently in COBOL](https://medium.com/the-technical-archaeologist/is-cobol-holding-you-hostage-with-math-5498c0eb428b). It handles decimals unlike any other programming language, which is particularly important for large financial systems working at the scale of the [SSA](https://www.ssa.gov/). What COBOL might calculate as 1,000.99, Java might calculate as 1,000.98. Neither number is wrong in a mathematical sense, but for an accounting and payment system designed around decades of COBOL-based math, the Java-based answer is functionally wrong. For a system making 840 million financial transactions annually, such a small difference in math can quickly spiral into a disaster.

Even if we imagine that there was a complete, successful replacement of the COBOL [mainframes](https://www.youtube.com/embed/ouAG4vXFORc?si=Jv0LsfZzeFZzmnTi) with a different programming language and different servers, it’s not at all clear that anybody would benefit. The existing systems get the job done. And the [mainframes](https://www.youtube.com/embed/ouAG4vXFORc?si=Jv0LsfZzeFZzmnTi) are just for the backend of the system that handles data storage, tracking and accounting. The front end — the parts of the system that the public sees — would be left untouched by such a modernization. If the existing backend functions fine, and the front end doesn’t require modernization, what could be the legitimate purpose of this incredibly dangerous operation?

There are two possible explanations: either the [DOGE](https://www.doge.gov/) programmers are so inexperienced and cocksure that they think this can actually work, or this is a cover for doing serious damage to the [Social Security](https;//www.ssa.gov/) system. As a nation, we cannot afford the risk that either of these explanations are right, or the even greater and more likely risk: that both explanations are right.

That the [SSA](https://www.ssa.gov/)’s systems are old is not evidence of them being problematic — on the contrary, it is evidence of their reliability and sustainability. There is no “one neat trick” that will make a complete overhaul possible in the span of a few months. Hard things are hard. [DOGE](https://www.doge.gov/)’s effort is likely to fail and threatens to bring down [Social Security](https://www.ssa.gov/) along with it.

*[Social Security](https;//www.ssa.gov/) systems contain tens of millions of lines of code written in COBOL, an archaic programming language. Safely rewriting that code would take years—[DOGE](https://www.doge.gov/) wants it done in months.*

[DOGE](https://www.doge.gov/)'s Ambitious Plan aims to migrate the [Social Security Administration (SSA)](https://www.ssa.gov/)'s systems off COBOL to a modern language like Java within a few months, risking significant disruptions.

🚨 System Integrity: The migration involves tens of millions of lines of COBOL code, crucial for managing payments to over 65 million beneficiaries. Experts warn that expedited timelines may lead to errors and omissions in payments.

🛠️ Historical Context: [SSA](https;//www.ssa.gov/)'s systems have not seen substantial updates since the 1980s, with COBOL being widely adopted since the 1950s. Previous modernization efforts have faced delays, particularly during the pandemic.

⚖️ Current Challenges: Following cuts and scrutiny from the Trump administration, [SSA](https;//www.ssa.gov/) has experienced frequent website crashes and long wait times, raising concerns about the feasibility of this rapid migration.
