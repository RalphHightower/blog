title: "Trump’s America First Will Leave America ‘Alone’. Pissing Off Allies, Trading Partners"
---

[Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s "America First" Policy will leave the United States Alone.

1. Tanking the world’s stock market with his trade war with the world. 
2. Texting war plans over unsecured, personal cellphones.
3. Pivot to Russia. 
4. Canada, Britain, Australia, New Zealand considering limiting intelligence sharing with the United States; not considered a reliable partner.
