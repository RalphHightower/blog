## ['Embarrassing': Trump administration fires its own lawyers for 'legal malpractice'](https://www.alternet.org/trump/trump-sean-duffy-new-york/)

Story by Adam Lynch. April 25 2025

The [New York Times reports](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/nyregion/nyc-congestion-pricing-duffy-lawyers.html) the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) is firing its own attorneys over alleged incompetence.

The [U.S. Department of Transportation](https://www.transportation.gov/) on Thursday made the peculiar move of replacing its federal lawyers defending it in a lawsuit over [New York City](https://www.ny.gov/)’s congestion pricing program, allegedly because the lawyers undermined the department’s case.

[New York](https://www.ny.gov/) wants to impose a $9 entrance fee to Manhattan to reduce gridlock, cut pollution and fund critical transit projects — but [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) called the program "illegal," and has demanded the state halt the plan or risk the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) slashing federal funding and approval for transit projects. [U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy](https://www.transportation.gov/meet-secretary/us-transportation-secretary-sean-duffy) [wrote a letter](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/nyregion/trump-nyc-congestion-pricing-threats.html) to [New York](https://www.ny.giv/) [Gov.](https://www.governor.ny.gov/) [Kathy Hochul](https://www.governor.ny.gov/about-governor-hochul) warning she has until May 21 to explain why his [department](https://www.transportation.gov/) should not withhold federal funding, with a promise to begin penalizing the state May 28.

[New York](https://www.ny.gov/) sued the [U.S. government](https://www.justice.gov/) over the threats in federal court, but yesterday the [Manhattan U.S. attorney](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny)’s office reported it had mistakenly filed a confidential memo that criticized the department’s legal strategy.

Strategy arguments are usually limited to client/attorney discussions and do not find themselves publicly submitted in court. Nevertheless, the court faced an 11-page letter suggesting the federal department build a stronger case by terminating the federal government’s approval of the tolling program “as a matter of changed agency priorities” rather than questioning the legality of the toll — which could be a difficult argument to establish in court.

The [Department of Transportation](https://www.transportation.gov/) raised the possibility of sabotage by its own attorneys in a statement today, calling the filing “legal malpractice.”

“Are [S.D.N.Y. lawyers](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny) on this case incompetent or was this their attempt to RESIST?” a federal spokeswoman wrote, according to the [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/).

U.S. attorney’s office spokesman Nicholas Biase assured the filing “was a completely honest error and was not intentional in any way,” but [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/) [Law School](https://www.law.nyu.edu/) professor [Roderick M. Hills Jr](https://its.law.nyu.edu/facultyprofiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=profile.overview&personid=26990) called the filing “a gigantic, obvious, objective blunder.”

“Oh my god — very embarrassing,” [Hills](https://its.law.nyu.edu/facultyprofiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=profile.overview&personid=26990) told the [NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/).
