## ['Ignore this amicus sophistry': WSJ editorial board in disbelief at Trump's latest antic](https://www.rawstory.com/tiktok-ban-2670712862/)

Story by Daniel Hampton. December 31, 2024

In 2020, [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) signed an executive order banning [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/) if it wasn't sold within 45 day.

In the intervening four years with [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) sulking like a spoiled brat at his [Mar-a-Lago golf resort](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) in hoity-toity Palm Beach, Florida, [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) passed a law banning [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/) in the US and [President Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) signed it into law.

[TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/) challenged the law and now the [Supreme Court](https:http://www.supremecourtus.gov/) will decide on the validity. 

Now, in 2024, [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) wants to keep [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/), before the law takes effect on January 19, 2025 if it can't be sold to a US company. How ironic! [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) ain't President until he takes the oath of office and sworn in as President the day after [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/) is shut down in the United States. 

The U.S. only has one president at a single moment in time.

But that's debatable with [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s second term as president, with Elon Musk as the puppeteer controlling [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s strings. This time he will be a lame-duck president. 

The [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/) editorial board weighed in on [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s last minute appeal to [Save TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/), calling his last ditch effort , "extraordinary in several ways, none of them good."

[Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) — who once signed an executive order four years ago threatening to ban the popular social media app — this month asked the [Supreme Court](https:http://www.supremecourtus.gov/) to let him "save" [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/) ahead of a looming nationwide ban set to take effect Jan. 19 if its Chinese parent company doesn’t sell it to a U.S. company.

[Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) asked the high court to delay the deadline until after he returns to the [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)so his administration can "seek a negotiated resolution." Doing so would allow the case to be resolved without the [Supreme Court](http://www.supremecourtus.gov/) interfering.

The [Journal's editorial board](https://www.wsj.com/) on Tuesday afternoon noted his amicus brief, which the high court will hear on Jan. 10, "implores the [Justices](https://www.supremecoyrt.gov/) to give him a chance to apply his 'dealmaking' skills to rescue [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/) from the Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act that passed Congress in April."

The [board](https://www.wsj.com/) was no fan of [Trump's](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) argument, which it said essentially "wants the [Supreme Court](https:http://www.supremecourtus.gov/) to treat him like a second President with Joe Biden so he can save [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/). The brief is extraordinary in several ways, none of them good. Mr. [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) wants the Court to treat him as if he’s already President before he’s inaugurated. [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) for all intents and purposes is a "private citizen" until he's inaugurated, the [board](https://www.wsj.com/) countered. He is also in essence "asking the Justices to let him rewrite a law he doesn’t like."

[Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), the [board](https://www.wsj.com/) said, "instructs the [Court](https:http://www.supremecourtus.gov/) that he deserves this power because he won the election and is a wizard on social media. Really, that’s his claim. We trust the [Justices](https://www.supremecoyrt.gov/) will ignore this amicus sophistry," the [Journal's board](https://www.wsj.https://www.wsj.com/) concluded.

The [board](https://www.wsj.com/) urged the justices to rebuff the MAGA leader and his argument that he has a special standing to represent U.S. [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/) users.

After touting himself as “one of the most powerful, prolific, and influential users of social media in history,” [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) argued that his “14.7 million followers on [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/) with whom he actively communicates,” allow him to “evaluate [TikTok's](https://www.tiktok.com/) importance as a unique medium for freedom of expression, including core political speech.”

In [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s amicus brief, which was submitted by D. John Sauer, [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s pick for solicitor general, the president-elect said he takes “no position on the merits of the dispute.” Instead, he argued that a negotiated resolution by his administration could “prevent a nationwide shutdown of [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/), thus preserving the [First Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/) rights of tens of millions of Americans, while also addressing the government’s national security concerns.”

[Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s calls to preserve free speech via the means of [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/).

@RalphHightower: **Hang on one second!** [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is an advocate of the [First Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/) guaranteeing freedom of the press and freedom of speech? Then why has he sued [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/) and the [Des Moines Register](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/)  I don't understand it!

The brief continued to make the case for the former reality star and billionaire, stating, “President [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the Government — concerns which [President Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) himself has acknowledged.”

@RalphHightower: **Hah!** *"The Art of the Deal"* 

Earlier this month, [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) met with with [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/) CEO Shou Chew at his [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) estate, [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/) reported. At the time, [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) voiced his change-of-heart toward the video app, which has been valued at $100 billion. “We’ll take a look at [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/). You know, I have a warm spot in my heart for [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/), because I won youth by 34 points,” [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) replied at a news conference when asked about the ban. “And there are those that say that [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/) has something to do with that.”

When addressing [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s pivot on the matter, Former House Speaker [Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.)](https://pelosi.house.gov/) told Politico, “When it comes to Donald [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), follow the money.”
