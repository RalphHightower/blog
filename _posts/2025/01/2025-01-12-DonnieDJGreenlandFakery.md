In this weekâ€™s Trump Trolls Trump, Mary takes on the latest absurdities from Donald and his allies, including his outrage over a lenient sentencing in New York, the bizarre moments at President Carter's funeral, and his nonsensical claims about windmills and water pressure. We also dive into the ridiculous notion of a Melania Trump documentary funded by Jeff Bezos and the ongoing fallout from disastrous right-wing rhetoric. Plus, we discuss the latest in California's wildfire crisis and the continued push for a Trump-led, expansionist agenda. Don't miss this week's deep dive into the chaos.
