## ['Dumbest of the dumb': Mockery ensues after White House drops statement with misspelling](https://www.rawstory.com/trump-mockery-colombia-mispelling/)

Story by David McAfee. January 26, 2025

[Colombia](https://www.gov.co/) refused repatriation of illegal immigrants from the [United States](https://.www.usa.gov/). [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) immediately imposed a tariff on [Colombia](https://www.gov.co/) for refusing permission for the plane to land.

[Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) issued a press release on [‚ÄúTruth Social‚Äù](https://truthsocial.com/) misspelling the nation's name:

- "ICYMI [President Donald J. Trump's](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) TRUTH on Columbia[^101] sanctions." 

Aaron Rupar, Journalist:

- "I‚Äôm more of a [North Face](https://www.thenorthface.com/)[^31] guy but this seems a bit extreme."

[^31]: Referencing [Columbia Outdoor Apparel and Products](https://www.columbia.com/) versus [North Face](https://www.thenorthface.com/)

Republicans against [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/):

- "[Trump's White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) misspelled ‚Äò[Colombia](https://www.gov.co/)‚Äô as ‚ÄòColumbia‚Äô[^101]‚Ä¶confusing the country with the [University](https://www.columbia.edu/) in an official announcement. ü§°"

Jeff Stein, [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) economics reporter for [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/):

- "I know Barron is going to [NYU](https://www.nyu.edu/) but it seems like a little much."

A.J. Delgado, Former [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) campaign aide:

- "Did a [WHITE HOUSE](https://www whitehouse.gov/) PRESS RELEASE really misspell [Colombia](https://www.gov.co/)? I remember how much I had to proof read and correct BASIC mistakes in drafts by others on the 2016 Campaign but this is... wow. Only the dumbest of the dumb work in this [White House](https://www whitehouse.gov/)."

Popular internet personality Three Year Letterman:

- "I can't top this."

A purported [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) lie tracker:

- "[Columbia](https://www.columbia.edu/) is a university in [New York City](https://www.nyc.gov/). [Colombia](https://www.gov.co/) is the country [Donald Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) threatened today. But talk to us about how competence is back in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)."

Christopher Hale, DNC delegate:

- "[White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, who recently disclosed over \$300,000 in unpaid campaign debts ‚Äî including approximately \$200,000 from illegal contributions ‚Äî can‚Äôt spell [Colombia](https://www.gov.co/)."

Chris D. Jackson, former Tennessee Democratic election commissioner:

- "For all the clowns hyping [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)‚Äôs move on [Colombia](https://www.gov.co/): under Biden, [Colombia](https://www.gov.co/) accepted 475 deportation flights‚Äîover 120 in 2024 alone. And he didn‚Äôt have to show his ass or start a trade war to do it. He was just that good."

Ruben Gallego, Democratic lawmaker:

- "This is a dumb trade war that the [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) admin started."

"This could have been resolved with a phone call. [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) picked a fight with an ally, to look strong," he said Sunday. "FYI get your orders in now for roses. We import a majority of roses from [Colombia](https://www.gov.co/)."

Bakari Sellers, Former Democratic lawmaker :

- "Adding some facts here. [Colombia](https://www.gov.co/) accepted 475 deportation flights under [Biden](https://.archives.gov/), more than 120 in 2024 alone. All this without a trade war."

Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to [Barack Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/homepage/):

- "Ooh, a dumb and pointless trade war in less than a week Great work!"

YouTube Channel @LiveFromTheResistance:

1. "And we have a trade war with [Colombia](https://www.gov.co/) in less than 1 week which will send prices of gasoline and products skyrocketing for Americans. Thanks [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)."

Aaron Parnas, Attorney:

- "The United States is officially in a trade war with [Colombia](https://www.gov.co/) because of [Donald Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). You know who will suffer? You."
