Four years have passed since thousands of insurrectionists swarmed the U.S. Capitol and sought to overturn the 2020 election results. [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and his allies in the [Trumpian Party](https://www.gop.com/) have flip-flopped, downplayed, and whitewashed the events of that day, and it's all by strategic design. MSNBC legal analyst Charles Coleman Jr. explains how members of the [Trump Party](https://www.gop.com/) have sought to obscure the reality of the insurrection and why we need to keep talking about it.
