Trump told Kristen Welker recently on [Meet the Press](https://youtu.be/b607aDHUu2I?si=INYC5x_cU_J06JVu), “Most likely, I’ll do it very quickly. Those people have suffered long and hard. And there may be some exceptions to it. I have to look. But, you know, if somebody was radical, crazy.”

### Those Complicit Trumper Legislators

1. [Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (T-GA14)](https://greene.house.gov/)[^21] – “Here we are nearly four years later. Many of these people have been in prison since 2021. Even the ones that fought Capitol Police](https://www.uscp.gov/), caused damage to the Capitol, I think they’ve served their time and I think they should all be pardoned and released from prison. Some of these people have been given prison sentences: 10 years, 18 years and more. I think it’s an injustice. It’s a two-tiered justice system, and it’s time to end it.”
2. [Rep. Jim Jordan (T-OH4)](https://jordan.house.gov/)[^22] – “For people who didn’t commit any violence, I think everyone supports that. I think that makes sense,” said [Jordan (T-OH4)](https://jordan.house.gov/).
3. [Rep. Gus Bilirakis (T-FL12)](https://bilirakis.house.gov/) – “You’ve got to look at it individually. Some probably deserve to be pardoned.” When asked about those who attacked [U.S. Capitol police officers](https://www.uscp.gov/), he added, “My goodness. Again, I’d have to look at the scenario. But if they attacked the [U.S. Capitol Police](https://www.uscp.gov/), it’s a big problem.”
4. [Rep. Dusty Johnson (T-SD)](https://dustyjohnson.house.gov/) said that there's a difference between those *"just trespassing"* and those that damaged property – “People who attacked [police officers](https://www.uscp.gov/), listen, I don’t think that is something we should ever condone.”

[^21]: @RalphHightower: How and why does the 14<sup>th</sup> keep electing [MTG](https://greene.house.gov/)? She's a conspiracy wacko!
[^22]: @RalphHightower: [Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/) is another blowhard.

Donald Trump is guilty of inciting an insurrection to occur on January 6, 2921 when he sent this message from his TwitterPhone: ["Peter Navarro releases 36-page report alleging election fraud 'more than sufficient' to swing victory to Trump https://t.co/D8KrMHnFdK. A great report by Peter. Statistically impossible to have lost the 2020 Election. Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!"](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1340185773220515840)

### Those Upholding Law and Order

- [US Capitol Police](https://www.uscp.gov/)](https://www.uscp.gov/) Officer Sgt. Aquilino Gonell, who retired due to his injuries after fighting rioters – “You cannot be pro-police officer and rule of law if you are pardoning people who betrayed that trust, injured police officers and ransacked the Capitol.”
- [Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD8)](https://raskin.house.gov/) – “Because anything that happens by these people, in a political context or some other context, will essentially be laid at the doorstep soon-to-be President Donald Trump.” He added that people should demand from those pardoned, contrition and repentance, and an affirmative statement that they pose no further threats to public safety. 
- [Rep. Bennie Thompson D-MS2)](https://benniethompson.house.gov/) – “Those 140-odd [law enforcement people](https://www.uscp.gov/) who got hurt defending this institution, I think anyone who loves peace and security would be offended that you would pardon people who attacked those individuals for doing their jobs.”
- [Rep. Jim Himes (D-CT4)](https://himes.house.gov/) – “I’m pretty controlled and pretty disciplined, but that would be really hard. Too many of us had very personal experiences with the people who are serving time or were convicted.”
