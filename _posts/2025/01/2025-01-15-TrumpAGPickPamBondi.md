[Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Il](https://www.durbin.senate.gov/), joins Morning Joe to discuss Tuesday's confirmation hearings for Pete Hegseth and Wednesday's hearing for Pam Bondi, President-elect Trump's pick for attorney general.

[^11]: @RalphHightower: It cost Jeff Sessions his job when he said no to Trump. Same thing happened to Billy Barr at the end of Trump's first term.
