@RalphHightower: Trump 1.0 was never good when handling disasters. Trump 2.0 handling of natural disasters will be equally abysmal; he is incapable of learning.

#### In summary

*President-elect Donald Trump faulted [California](https://www.ca.gov/) water policies for the devastating wildfires that are burning in [Los Angeles County](https://lacounty.gov/). The fires started because of fierce winds and extremely dry conditions.*

#### Trump's Divide and Conquer Tactic

- Trump on his social media site, *“Truth Social”*, Jan 08, 2025, 11:40 AM:</br > “[Governor Gavin Newscum](https://www.gov.ca.gov/) refused to sign the water restoration declaration put before him that would have allowed millions of gallons of water, from excess rain and snow melt from the North, to flow daily into many parts of [California](https://www ca.gov/), including the areas that are currently burning in a virtually apocalyptic way. He wanted to protect an essentially worthless fish called a smelt, by giving it less water (it didn’t work!), but didn’t care about the people of [California](https://www.ca.gov/). Now the ultimate price is being paid. I will demand that this incompetent [governor](https://www.gov.ca.gov/about/) allow beautiful, clean, fresh water to FLOW INTO [CALIFORNIA!](https://www ca.gov/) He is the blame for this. On top of it all, no water for fire hydrants, not firefighting planes. A true disaster!” 

- [California Governor Gavin Newsom](https://www.gov.ca.gov/about/) communications director Izzy Gordon: </br >“There is no such document as the water restoration declaration – that is pure fiction. The Governor is focused on protecting people, not playing politics, and making sure firefighters have all the resources they need.”


##### Trumpian Fallacy 

But here’s the kink in Trump’s logic: The Central Valley Project provides no water to Los Angeles. The regional water district receives some water from the State Water Project, which also collects water from the Delta-Bay area and shares some reservoirs and infrastructure with the Central Valley Project. But most of the extra water from Trump’s plan would have been sent to the San Joaquin Valley, and it’s wrong to connect water management further north to the firefighting challenges in Los Angeles.

In this article, [Northern California](https://www ca.gov/) had an abundance of rain while [ Southern California](https://www.ca.gov/) is experiencing a severe drought

##### Fire Fighting Infrastructure 

The hydrants systems can handle a structure fire or two. But the system cannot handle multiple neighborhoods, communities, aflame simultaneously. 

Three main water tanks near the Palisades, each holding about 1 million gallons, were filled in preparation of the fire because of dangerous weather. The tanks were all depleted by 3 a.m. on Jan. 8, [Los Angeles Department of Water and Power](https://www.ladwp.com/) CEO and Chief Engineer Janisse Quiñones said during a Jan. 8 press conference. Although water continued to flow to the affected areas, demand for water rose faster than the system could deliver it. 

"There’s water in the trunk line, it just cannot get up the hill, because we cannot fill the tanks fast enough," 
Quiñones said. "And we cannot lower the amount of water that we provide to the fire department in order to supply the tanks, because we’re balancing firefighting with water."

LOS ANGELES – Governor Gavin Newsom today issued the following statement after President Trump took a slew of executive actions aimed at reversing America’s progress on climate, including withdrawing from the Paris Agreement – the international treaty for combating climate change.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE [SECRETARY OF COMMERCE](https://www.commerce.gov/)

THE [SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR](https://www.doi.gov/) 

SUBJECT:    Putting People over Fish: Stopping Radical

Environmentalism to Provide Water to [Southern

California](https://www.ca.gov/)

I hereby direct the [Secretary of Commerce](https://www.commerce.gov/) and [Secretary of the Interior](https://www.doi.gov/), in consultation with the heads of other departments and agencies of the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) as necessary, to immediately restart the work from my first [Administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) by the [National Marine Fisheries Service](https://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/), [U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service](https://www.fws.gov/), [Bureau of Reclamation](https://www.usbr.gov/), and other agencies to route more water from the [Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta](https://www.ca.gov/) to other parts of the state for use by the people there who desperately need a reliable water supply. 

During my first term, the [State of California](https://www.ca.gov/), at the direction of its [Governor](https://www.gov.ca.gov/), filed a lawsuit to stop my [Administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) from implementing improvements to [California’s](https://www.ca.gov/) water infrastructure. My [Administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s plan would have allowed enormous amounts of water to flow from the snow melt and rainwater in rivers in [Northern California](https://www.ca.gov/) to beneficial use in the [Central Valley](https://www.ca.gov/) and [Southern California](https://www.ca.gov/). This catastrophic halt was allegedly in protection of the Delta smelt and other species of fish. Today, this enormous water supply flows wastefully into the Pacific Ocean. 

The recent deadly and historically destructive wildfires in [Southern California](https://www.ca.gov/) underscore why the [State of California](https://www.ca.gov/) needs a reliable water supply and sound vegetation management practices in order to provide water desperately needed there, and why this plan must immediately be reimplemented.

Within 90 days of the date of this memorandum, the [Secretary of Commerce](https://www.commerce.gov/) and [Secretary of the Interior](https://www.doi.gov/) shall report to me regarding the progress made in implementing the policies in this memorandum and provide any recommendations regarding future implementation.
