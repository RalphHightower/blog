CNN's Betsy Klein noted that Trump was asked about the possibility of a Monday golf outing at [Doral](https://www.trumphotels.com/miami) while on Air Force One on Saturday.

"No. I don't think so. I'm busy," the [president](https://www.whitehouse.com/) stated.

[Trump's](https://www.whitehouse.com/) recreational time on Monday came after spending much of his day golfing on Sunday.
