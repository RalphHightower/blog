Elon Musk is facing a lawsuit from the [SEC](https://www.sec.gov/) for failing to properly disclose his minority stake in [Twitter](https://twitter.com/), now [X](https://x.com/), and for allegedly underpaying investors, while he's also embroiled in a series of legal battles over Twitterâ€™s layoffs and his controversial push for an "everything app." His interference in global politics, such as aligning with far-right parties in the [UK](https://www.gov.uk/)and [Germany](https://www.bundesregierung.de/(, highlights the growing concern over the concentration of communicative power in the hands of wealthy tech moguls, undermining democratic processes and policy decisions.
