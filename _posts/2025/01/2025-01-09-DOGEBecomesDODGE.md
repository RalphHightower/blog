## [Elon Musk Walks Back Vow To Find $2 Trillion In Wasteful Spending / HuffPost Latest News](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/elon-musk-doge-2-trillion_n_677fc53ce4b07fd941897923)

*Musk's boast that he could easily find the budgetary savings was never realistic. Now he's being more modest.*

“We’ll try for 2 trillion. I think that’s like the best-case outcome, but I do think that you kind of have to have some overage. I think if we try for $2 trillion, we’ve got a good shot at getting one. In terms of saving money in the government, well, as you, as you know, it’s a very target-rich environment for saving money. It’s like being in a room full of targets, like you can close your eyes and you can’t miss.” – [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) backpedaled, but only after he won the election, on lowering the price of eggs, bacon, and groceries, saying, "Gosh. Who knew that lowering groceries would be so hard." It’s a notable retrenchment from [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)’s prior position. On the campaign trail in October, [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) said he could find “at least \$2 trillion” to cut from the federal government’s annual budget of more than $6 trillion.

### Untouchables

| Spending | Promises |
|---|---|
| [Social Security](https://www.ssa.gov/) | [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) |
| [Medicare](https://www.medicare.gov/) | [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) |
| [Defense](https://www.defense.gov/) | [Trumpers](https://www.gop.com/)[^51] |

[^51]: @RalphHightower: It used to be the [Republican Party](https://www.gop.com/), but it died when it picked an unqualified, unfit person as their presidential candidate. 

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and [Trumpers](https://www.gop.com/) have nevertheless embraced [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) as a budget visionary, with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) naming him to a nongovernment advisory panel called the [Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)](https://www.doge.gov/). [Trumpians](https://www.gop.com/) then jumped on the [DOGE](https://www.doge.gov/) bandwagon without realizing the name is a joke based on an internet meme about a Shiba Inu dog.

It’s hard to see how [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)’s budget-slashing vision, which is supposed to close the gap between taxes and spending, will fit with [Trumper](https://www.gop.com/) plans to extend [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s 2017 tax cuts, potentially at a cost of $5 trillion over a decade, with trillions more in additional tax cuts Trump promised on the campaign trail.

Still, [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) repeated part of his prior boast that cutting federal spending is actually very easy.
