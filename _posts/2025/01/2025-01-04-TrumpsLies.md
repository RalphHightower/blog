excerpt: "“I'm actually glad you asked this question because one of the things that you all do as a journalists' body is that you were able to fact check and say that what was stated by the president-elect was simply false. And, I think that is important, right? Which is why we respect the hard work that all of you do. As it relates to the president and the information that he gets, obviously that's something that's for ODNI if it's related to intelligence and specific information and that nature. I'm not going to speculate beyond that, and I'm just going to leave it there.” – Jean-Pierre, White House spokesperson."

## ['No': Trump's latest demand gets curt shutdown from White House spokesperson](https://www.alternet.org/jan-6-carter/)

Story by Jennifer Bowers Bahney, Raw Story. January 4, 205.

Trump's assertion on TruthSocial that "The [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) all 'giddy' about our magnificent American Flag potentially being at 'half mast' during my inauguration. They think it's so great and are so happy about it because, in actuality, they don't love our country, they only think about themselves. In any event, because of the death of President Jimmy Carter, the Flag may, for the first time ever during an Inauguration of a future President, be at half mast. Nobody wants to see this, and no American can be happy about it. Let’s see how it plays out. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"

@RalphHightower: That statement about not loving America is totally, fucking false! I was an independent voter from 1972 through 2016. I had to switch to [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) for the 2018 elections because what were then [Trumpians](https://www.gop.com/)at the state and federal become infected with Trump's MAGA-mania! Prior to the 2024 presidential election, I had concerns about democracy. Post election, I have fears for democracy. 

The first reporter asked, "President-elect Trump seemed to take issue today with the fact that flags will be flown at half mast at the time of his inauguration, considering the passing of former President Jimmy Carter... Is that a position that the White House would consider reversing or re-evaluating?"

Jean-Pierre answered simply and curtly, "No."

Former President Carter, a [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/), died Dec. 29 at the age of 100. President Biden ordered flags lowered to half staff in tribute for 30 days from Carter’s death, which encompasses Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20.

[NBC's](https://www.nbcnews.com/) Kelly O'Donnell asked about the "misinformation" Trump has been peddling on social media about Biden's "open border policy" being responsible for the New Year's Eve terrorist attack in New Orleans.

"President-elect Trump had communicated on his social media some inaccurate information relating to New Orleans this week. Is the president at all concerned about the flow of information, and briefing, and access to whatever intelligence or whatever he might need in terms of this transition. Is he comfortable with the information flow to the president-elect?"

Jean-Pierre began her answer by giving props to the media.

"I'm actually glad you asked this question because one of the things that you all do as a journalists' body is that you were able to fact check and say that what was stated by the president-elect was simply false. And, I think that is important, right? Which is why we respect the hard work that all of you do. As it relates to the president and the information that he gets, obviously that's something that's for ODNI if it's related to intelligence and specific information and that nature. I'm not going to speculate beyond that, and I'm just going to leave it there."

@RalphHightower: Freedom of the press, our Nation’s first amendment, will going disappear under Trump's rule[^101]. He is going to sue, persecute, and prosecute all news organizations and journalists that fact check him.

[^101]: @RalphHightower: Trump does not serve as president. He only serves himself and nobody else. Demagog came to me writing this. The first definition[^121] fits Trump to a "T".

[^121]: [demagog • Merriam-Webster:](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/demagog)<br />noun<br />dem·​a·​gogue <br />variants: or less commonly dem​a​gog<br />Definition (Entry 1 of 2)<br /> **1: a leader who makes use of popular prejudices and false claims and promises in order to gain power**<br />~~2: a leader championing the cause of the common people in ancient times~~
