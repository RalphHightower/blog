Mary dives into the confirmation hearing for Pete Hegseth, President Trump's nominee for [Secretary of Defense](https://www.defense.gov/). The hearing exposed Hegseth's alarming lack of qualifications, his history of sexual assault accusations, and his controversial views on women in the military. Senators like [Tim Kaine (D-VA)]https://www.kaine.senate.gov/) and [Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)](https://www.warren.senate.gov/) grilled Hegseth on his fitness for the role, while Trumpians attempted to deflect and defend his candidacy. As the hearing continues, it's clear that Hegseth's nomination is more about loyalty to Trump than actual competence to lead the [Department of Defense](https://www.defense.gov/).
