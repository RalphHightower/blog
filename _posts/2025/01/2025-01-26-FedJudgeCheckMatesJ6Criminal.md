Jan 24, 2025  The Intersection with Popok
Federal Judges are linking arms and opposing Trump's pardons and sentence commuting any way they can and for history's sake,  Popok reports on [Judge Mehta](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/district-judge-amit-p-mehta) in the [DC Court](https:www.dcd.uscourts.gov/) permanently blocking the Oath Keepers and their leader Stuart Rhodes, who were convicted of attempting to violently overthrow our government, from ever entering DC again without court permission.
