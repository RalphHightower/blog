In this episode, Mary discusses the Biden administration's new AI chip export restrictions aimed at curbing China's access to cutting-edge US technology, which could reshape global power dynamics. Despite pushback from the tech industry, these regulations are part of a broader strategy to keep AI development within trusted, secure environments, though challenges remain as China continues to make strides in AI innovation.

@RalphHightower: This AI chip ban could affect Elon Musk’s Tesla manufacturing operations in China.
