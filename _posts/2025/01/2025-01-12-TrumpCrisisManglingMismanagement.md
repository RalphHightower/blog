In this episode, Mary Trump examines Donald Trump's failure to lead during crises, specifically the wildfires that devastated California. Instead of helping, he uses the disaster to spread misinformation and attack political foes. From Trumpâ€™s disastrous handling of past crises like Hurricane Maria and COVID-19 to his ongoing divisiveness, we highlight how his approach only worsens situations. As his return to office looms, the dangerous consequences of his leadership style become even clearer.
