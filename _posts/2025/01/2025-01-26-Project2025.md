excerpt: "President Donald Trump fulfills his promise for a “shock and awe” campaign by firing over a dozen inspectors general across several government agencies. It’s a purge that could clear the way for Trump to install loyalists, a move straight out of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2024 conservative blueprint."

[President Donald Trump](https://www whitehouse.gov/) fulfills his promise for a "shock and awe" campaign by firing over a dozen inspectors general across several government agencies. It's a purge that could clear the way for [Trump](https://www whitehouse.gov/) to install loyalists, a move straight out of the [Heritage Foundation's](https://www.heritage.org/) [Project 2024](https://www.project2025.org/) conservative blueprint. MSNBC's Ayman Mohyeldin spoke with Former New Hampshire Republican Party Chair Jennifer Horn and MSNBC's Basil Smikle about [Trump's](https://www whitehouse.gov/) [Project 2025](https://www.project2025.org/) presidency: from his executive orders to his Friday night massacre.
