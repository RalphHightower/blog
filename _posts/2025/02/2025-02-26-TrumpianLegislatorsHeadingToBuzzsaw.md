## ['Walking into a political buzzsaw': GOP warned latest move could push voters over edge](https://www.rawstory.com/gop-2671224385/)

Story by Tom Boggioni February 26, 2025

The budget deal that was passed late Tuesday by the [Trumpian](https://www.gop.com/)-controlled [House](https://www.house.gov/) with the slimmest of margins could be the beginning of the end for the [Trumpian](https://www.gop.com/) party, an analyst told MSNBC Wednesday.

Speaking with host Joe Scarborough, Puck's John Heilemann said the combination of budget cuts, in addition to [Elon Musk's](https://x.com/elonmusk/) [DOGE](https://doge.gov/) efforts to destroy government programs, will push voters — including [Trumpians](https://www.gop.com/) —[over the edge.](https://www.rawstory.com/republicans-disaster-in-the-making/?).

"They're walking into a political buzzsaw here where if they think that the pushback they've seen so far [at these town halls](https://www.rawstory.com/mccormick-doge-georgia/) has been problematic, and it has been so bad that they're shutting them down, you can't imagine what they're about to hit," he told the "Morning Joe" host.

'When they try to cut $300 billion out of [Medicaid](https://www.medicaid.gov/) which, as you said, touches both red and blue states and districts alike it is going to be, I think, it's going to be politically impossible for them to be able to make that level of cuts. "
