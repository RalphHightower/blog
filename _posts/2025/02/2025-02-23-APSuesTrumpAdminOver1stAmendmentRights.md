## [AP sues 3 Trump administration officials, citing freedom of speech / AP News](https://apnews.com/article/ap-lawsuit-trump-administration-officials-0352075501b779b8b187667f3427e0e8)

By  DAVID BAUDER
Updated 10:11 PM EST, February 21, 2025

The [Associated Press](https://www.apnews.com/) sued [three Trump administration officials](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) Friday over access to presidential events, citing freedom of speech in asking a federal judge to stop [the blocking of its journalists](https://apnews.com/article/trump-ap-journalism-first-amendment-8a83d8b506053249598e807f8e91e1ae). “We’ll see them in court,” the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) press secretary said in response.

The lawsuit was filed Friday afternoon in [U.S. District Court](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/) in [Washington, D.C.](https://dc.gov/), 10 days after the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) began restricting access to the news agency. It was assigned to [U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/district-judge-trevor-n-mcfadden), a [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) nominee.

The [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) says its case is about an unconstitutional effort by the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  to control speech — in this case [not changing its style](https://www.ap.org/the-definitive-source/announcements/ap-style-guidance-on-gulf-of-mexico-mount-mckinley/) from the Gulf of Mexico to the “Gulf of America,” as [President Donald Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) did last month with an executive order.

“The press and all people in the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) have the right to choose their own words and not be retaliated against by the government,” the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) said in its lawsuit, which names [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) chief of staff Susan Wiles, deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich and press secretary Karoline Leavitt.

“This targeted attack on the [AP’s](https://www.apnews.com/) editorial independence and ability to gather and report the news strikes at the very core of the [First Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/),” the news agency said. “This court should remedy it immediately.” [The Constitution’s First Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/) guarantees freedom of the press, speech and religion and bars the government from obstructing any of them.

Leavitt said that she learned about the lawsuit Friday while driving from the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) to an appearance at the [Conservative Political Action Conference](https://www.cpac.org/).

“I wanted to get the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) counsel on the phone before taking this stage to see what I can and cannot say but, look, we feel we are in the right in this position,” she said. “We’re going to ensure that truth and accuracy is present at that [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) every single day.”

### [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) directly cited [AP’s editorial decision](https://www.apnews.com/)

In stopping the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) from attending press events at the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/), or flying on [Air Force One](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/air-force-one/) in the agency’s customary spot, the [Trump team](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) directly cited the [AP’s](https://www.apnews.com/) decision not to fully follow the president’s renaming.

“We’re going to keep them out until such time as they agree that it’s the Gulf of America,” [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) said Tuesday.

This week, about 40 news organizations signed onto a letter organized by the [White House Correspondents Association](https://whca.press/), urging the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) to reverse its policy against the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/). They included outlets like [Fox News Channel](https://www.foxnews.com/) and [Newsmax](https://www.newsmax.com/), where many of the on-air commentators are [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) supporters.

“We can understand [President Trump’s](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) frustration because the media has often been unfair to him, but [Newsmax](https://www.newsmax.com/) still supports [AP’s](https://www.apnews.com/) right, as a private organization, to use the language it wants to use in its reporting,” [Newsmax](https://www.newsmax.com/) said in a statement. “We fear a future administration may not like something [Newsmax](https://www.newsmax.com/) writes and seek to ban us.”

While [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) journalists have still been allowed on [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) grounds, they have been kept out of the “pool” of journalists that cover events in smaller spaces and report back to its readers and other reporters. The [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) has been part of [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) pools for more than a century.

The lawsuit said the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) had made “several unsuccessful efforts” to persuade the administration that its conduct was unlawful. Julie Pace, AP’s senior vice president and executive editor, traveled to Florida this week to meet with Wiles.

### The [AP Stylebook](https://www.apstylebook.com/) is a sticking point

In an email to [AP](https://www.apnews.com/), Wiles said the news organization was targeted because its influential stylebook is used as a standard by many journalists, scholars and students across the country, the lawsuit said. She said the administration was hopeful the name change would be reflected in the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) Stylebook “where American audiences are concerned.”

The [Stylebook](https://www.apstylebook.com/) is used by international audiences, as well as those within the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/). The [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) has said that its guidance was offered to promote clarity, and that even though Gulf of Mexico will continue to be used, journalists should also note [Trump’s](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) action to change the name.

A [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/restoring-names-that-honor-american-greatness/) to change the name of the United States’ largest mountain back to Mount McKinley from Denali is being recognized by the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) [Stylebook](https://www.apstylebook.com/). Trump has the authority to do so because the mountain is completely within the country he oversees, [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) has said.

Wiles also wrote to the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) that its stylebook’s influence “has been misused, and at times weaponized, to push a divisive and partisan agenda,” according to the lawsuit.

In an Axios story last week, Budowich noted other [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) [Stylebook](https://www.apstylebook.com/) entries that have rankled some conservatives. They include the decision to capitalize Black but not white in racial references, guidance on gender-affirming medical care and direction not to use the term “illegal immigrants.”

In a radio interview with [Fox News’](https://www.foxnews.com/) Brian Kilmeade on Friday, [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) referred to the [Associated Press](https://www.apnews.com/) as “radical left lunatics.” He said that “[Associated Press](https://www.apnews.com/) is a third-rate outfit with a first-rate name.”

He said “just about everybody” accepted the Gulf of America name change but “[AP](https://www.apnews.com/) wants to be cute.” There has been a mixed response from other news organizations: The [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) and [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) are continuing to use Gulf of Mexico, while [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/) has switched to [Trump’s](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) choice. [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) is using Gulf of America for users in the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/).

### [Statement on White House Excluding AP from News Coverage / White House  Correspondents' Association (WHCA)](https://whca.press/2025/02/11/statement-on-white-house-excluding-ap-from-news-coverage/)

February 11, 2025

In the relationship between the press and the [Office of the President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), coverage and standards are entirely in the purview of individual organizations.

The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  cannot dictate how news organizations report the news, nor should it penalize working journalists because it is unhappy with their editors’ decisions. The move by the administration to bar a reporter from The [Associated Press](https://www.apnews.com/) from an official event open to news coverage today is unacceptable.

The [WHCA](https://whca.press/) stands with The [Associated Press](https://www.apnews.com/) and calls on the administration to immediately change course.

-Eugene Daniels, president of the [WHCA](https://whca.press/)

### [WHCA on "attempted government censorship of a free press" / White House Correspondents' Association (WHCA)](https://whca.press/2025/02/13/whca-on-attempted-government-censorship-of-a-free-press/)

February 13, 2025

“The White House’s decision to bar [Associated Press](https://www.apnews.com/) reporters from today’s press conference with [President Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and [Prime Minister Modi](http://www.pmindia.gov.in/en/pms-profile/) is outrageous and a deeply disappointing escalation of an already unacceptable situation. Let me be clear: the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  is seeking to curtail the press freedoms enshrined in our [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/), and has admitted publicly they are restricting access to events to punish a news outlet for not advancing the government’s preferred language.

“Free speech and a free press are among the defining values of American democracy and must be preserved and protected. Our pool system is critical to ensure all of our members can cover the presidency, and prohibiting journalists from access because of their editorial decisions is viewpoint discrimination.

“The attempted government censorship of a free press risks a chilling effect on journalists doing their job without fear or favor on behalf of the American people.

“This is a textbook violation of not only the [First Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/), but the [president’s](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) own [executive order on freedom of speech and ending federal censorship](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/restoring-freedom-of-speech-and-ending-federal-censorship/)[^89]. We again call on the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  to immediately reverse course and restore access to [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) journalists.”

COMPLAINT
Plaintiff The [Associated Press](https://www.apnews.com/) (“the AP”) brings this suit against Defendants Taylor
Budowich, Karoline Leavitt and Susan Wiles, each in their official capacities, and states as
follows:
INTRODUCTION
1. The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  has ordered The [Associated Press](https://www.apnews.com/) to use certain words in its
coverage or else face an indefinite denial of access. The press and all people in the United States

p. 2
      2
have the right to choose their own words and not be retaliated against by the government. The
Constitution does not allow the government to control speech. Allowing such government
control and retaliation to stand is a threat to every American’s freedom.
2. The [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) therefore brings this action to vindicate its rights to the editorial
independence guaranteed by the United States Constitution and to prevent the Executive Branch
from coercing journalists to report the news using only government-approved language.
3. The [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) is one of the world’s oldest and most trusted news organizations. Since
its inception in 1846, the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/), which is a not-for-profit organization, has been known for its
accurate, factual, and nonpartisan reporting, including on the [President of the United States](https://www.usa.gov/) and
the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). The [AP’s](https://www.apnews.com/) journalism reaches four billion people per day via major news
outlets around the world, whatever their political orientation, and has received 59 [Pulitzer Prizes](https://www.pulitzer.org/)
for its courageous coverage of key moments of world history.
4. The [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) has participated in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  press pool since its creation over a
century ago, which has made it possible for the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) to deliver to the public timely and thorough
reporting on the President almost everywhere he goes, which is information critical to the public.
5. On February 11, 2025, without prior notice, [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  officials informed the
AP that it would be barred from entering certain areas in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  as a member of the
press pool unless the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) began referring to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America, following
[President Trump’s](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) renaming of that body of water in [Executive Order 14172](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/restoring-freedom-of-speech-and-ending-federal-censorship/). The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)
began banning [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) journalists from events open to the press pool within hours.
6. The [White House’s](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) actions were taken in response to an editorial decision by the
[AP](https://www.apnews.com/) to refer to the Gulf of Mexico “by its original name while acknowledging the new name

p. 3
      3
[Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has chosen.”1
 The [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) explained in its [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) [Stylebook](https://,www.apstylebook.com/), which embodies the [AP’s](https://www.apnews.com/) editorial
standards, that, “[a]s a global news agency that disseminates news around the world, the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) must
ensure that place names and geography are easily recognizable to all audiences.”
7. On February 14, the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  made its ban of the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) indefinite, announcing
on [X](https://x.com/) (formerly [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) that, because the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) had not complied with its demand to use the name
Gulf of America, [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) journalists were now indefinitely banned from “access to limited spaces,
like the [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and [Air Force One](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/air-force-one/).” To date, the AP’s reporters and photographers remain
banned from the Oval Office, [Air Force One](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/air-force-one/), and other locations open not only to pool members,
but also to a larger group of journalists with [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  press credentials.
8. In an email to the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) on February 18, 2025, [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  Chief of Staff Susan
Wiles explained “why we arrived in this point.” Wiles wrote that the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  was targeting
the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) because its [Stylebook](https://www.apstylebook.com/) “is used by many as a standard for writing and editing,” and that it
“advises journalists, scholars and classrooms around our country.” Wiles finished her email by
noting, “we remain hopeful that the name of the [Gulf] will be appropriately reflected in the
[Stylebook](https://www.apstylebook.com/) where American audiences are concerned,” implying that the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) could change its
guidance as to American audiences to resolve the issue and restore its access.
9. [President Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has since doubled down on his [Administration’s](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) targeting of the
[AP](https://www.apnews.com/), saying, “[w]e’re going to keep them out until such time that they agree that it’s the Gulf of

https://www.ap.org/the-definitive-source/announcements/ap-style-guidance-on-gulf-of-mexico￾mount-mckinley (emphasis added).

p. 4
      4
America” and that the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) “has been very, very wrong on the election, on [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and the
treatment of [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).”2
10. This Court should order that the government immediately cease its retaliatory
actions against the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/), retaliation which is based solely on the content of the [AP's](https://www.apnews.com/) speech, and
rescind its denial of the AP’s access to the [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov), [Air Force One](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/air-force-one/), and other limited spaces
when such spaces are made open to other members of the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  press pool.
11. The ban violates the [Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-5/) to the [U.S.
Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/). As the [D.C. Circuit](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/) has made clear, journalists’ “[first amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/) interest” in
access to the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  “undoubtedly qualifies as liberty which may not be denied without
due process of law under the [fifth amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/amendment-5/).” Sherrill v. Knight, 569 F.2d 124, 130-31 (D.C.
Cir. 1977). Defendants gave the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) no prior or written notice of, and no formal opportunity to
challenge, their arbitrary determination that the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) would indefinitely lose access to the Oval
Office, [Air Force One](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/air-force-one/), and other limited areas as a member of the press pool – as well as access
to larger locations open to a wider group of journalists and reporters with [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  press
credentials – unless the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) adopted the Administration’s preferred language in its reporting.
12. The ban also violates the [First Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/) to the U.S. [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/). The [D.C.
Circuit](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/) has made clear that denying journalists access to [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  press events “based upon
the content of the journalist’s speech” is “prohibited under the [first amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/).” Sherrill, 569
F.2d at 129. Having opened the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  and certain areas to the press, the [First
Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/) “requires that this access not be denied arbitrarily or for less than compelling

See, e.g., David Bauder, [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) Says [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) Will Continue to Be Curtailed at [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  Until It
Changes Style to Gulf of America, [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) (Feb. 18, 2025), https://apnews.com/article/trump-ap￾white-house-press-corps-pool-91535a6384d681fee1cd7e384ea6c627; Trump Restricts [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) Access

reasons.” Ateba v. Jean-Pierre, 706 F. Supp. 3d 63, 75-76 (D.D.C. 2023) (quoting Sherrill, 569
F.2d at 129) (emphasis in original), appeal argued, No. 24-5004 (D.C. Cir. Oct. 15, 2024).
Defendants have not provided, nor could they provide, any compelling reason for their arbitrary
denial of the AP’s access. Rather, Defendants’ actions are impermissibly based on their dislike
of the content of the AP’s expression and what they perceive as the AP’s viewpoint reflected in
the content of its expression. The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  ban of the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) also constitutes impermissible
retaliation, as it was instituted to punish the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) for its constitutionally protected speech in ways
that would chill the speech of a reasonable person of ordinary firmness.
13. After making several unsuccessful efforts to persuade Defendants that their
conduct is contrary to well-established law, the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) now brings this action to vindicate its
constitutional rights, restore its access to the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), and ensure that the press remains free
to report on the Administration without fear of selective, arbitrary denials of access.
PARTIES
14. Plaintiff the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) is a not-for-profit news cooperative organized under the laws of
the State of New York. The [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) is one of the world’s most trusted news sources, reaching four
billion people per day, including with its coverage of the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).
15. Defendant Taylor Budowich is the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  Deputy Chief of Staff. He is
sued in his official capacity.
16. Defendant Karoline Leavitt is the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  Press Secretary. She is sued in
her official capacity.
17. Defendant Susan Wiles is the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  Chief of Staff. She is sued in her
official capacity.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE
18. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331.
19. Venue is proper in this judicial district under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B). A
substantial part of the events giving rise to this action occurred in this district, and Defendants
are officers of the United States sued in their official capacities.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  Press Pool
20. The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  press pool consists of journalists who regularly report to the
public about the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), and other Executive Branch activity in Washington,
DC and globally. The press pool accompanies the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) almost everywhere he goes,
ensuring that the public is informed of his activity and that the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and his administration
are held accountable to the public.
21. Because there often is not enough space in the Oval Office or on [Air Force One](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/air-force-one/) to
accommodate every journalist who covers the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), a minimum 13-person press pool serves
as the eyes and ears of the full press corps, and of the public.
22. In all of its permutations the press pool consists of, at minimum, three wire
reporters (one each from the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/), and [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/), four photographers (one each from
the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/), [AFP](http://www.afp.com/), and [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/), three network television journalists, a radio
correspondent, and at least one print reporter. Membership in the pool is determined at the sole
discretion of the [White House Correspondents Association (WHCA)](https://whca.press/) and the press corps itself.
See, e.g., https://whca.press/covering-the-white-house/resources/guide-to-the-white-house-beat/.

p. 7
      7
23. On information and belief, the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  has never interfered with the [WHCA](https://whca.press/)
and [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  press corps’ prerogative to determine the organizations that make up the [White
House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) press pool.
24. In circumstances when logistics dictate that the full press pool cannot accompany
the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), such as during [President Biden’s](bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov) secret trip to Kyiv in 2023 or [President Trump’s](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)
secret trip from Palm Beach to [Joint Base Andrews](https://www.jba.af.mil/) to begin a secret trip to [Afghanistan](https://moi.gov.af/) in 2019,
the [WHCA](https://whca.press/)—not the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)—determines the membership of an even more narrowly
limited temporary pool.
25. Conversely, when logistics permit more journalists to accompany the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/),
the [WHCA](https://whca.press/) determines the membership of an expanded pool, such as during press events held in
large spaces, including the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [East Room](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), and the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  admits additional
journalists.
26. The [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) has been a member of the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  press pool since the pool’s
inception well over a century ago, and as a result, has been able to report to the public first-hand
on some of history’s most defining events. In fact, an [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) reporter became the first recorded
presidential “pooler” in 1881, providing updates to fellow reporters from his post outside the
[White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) sick room of President James A. Garfield after he was shot. [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) pool journalists
were also in the motorcade in Dallas when President John F. Kennedy, Jr. was assassinated,
providing the nation with contemporaneous, fact-based reporting as the story developed, and as
conspiracy theories spread. And, [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) journalists were in the pool with President George W. Bush
when he learned of the September 11 terrorist attacks during an event in [Florida](https://www.myflorida.com/), and they
accompanied him on [Air Force One](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/air-force-one/) to secure locations in [Louisiana](https://www.louisiana.gov/) and [Nebraska](https://www.nebraska.gov/) and back to

[Washington](https://dc.gov/). Pool members like the wire services have the broadest reach and thus the
information they report gets to the widest possible audience.
27. As a participant in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  press pool, the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) has long provided at least
two [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)-credentialed journalists—one text reporter and one photographer—to the [Oval
Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and other areas of the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  when events open to the press are held in those areas.
28. The [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) has also long sent one text reporter and one photographer to travel with
the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) in the 13-seat press pool on [Air Force One](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/air-force-one/).
1. Full access to places and events to which other members of the press pool are
admitted is essential to the [AP’s](https://www.apnews.com/) ability to provide the public with fast, accurate, and
comprehensive coverage of the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and his administration. When the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) is denied access,
the thousands of global news outlets that republish the [AP’s](https://www.apnews.com/) news reports, and the billions of
people that rely on its reporting, also are denied access.
The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  Attempts to Control the [AP’s](https://www.apnews.com/) Speech
30. Upon information and belief, the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  has never before attempted to bar
an entire news organization from membership in the press pool and from accessing those spaces
open to other members of the pool.
31. During the prior [Trump Administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  had targeted the press
by revoking the “hard pass” press credentials of two [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  correspondents, [CNN’s](https://www.cnn.com/) Jim
Acosta and [Playboy’s](https://www.playboy.com/) Brian Karem, but had not barred all journalists at those organizations from
accessing events open to the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  press corps. Those access denials were held unlawful
by this Court.
32. On the morning of February 11, 2025, [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  Press Secretary Karoline
Leavitt summoned [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) Chief [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  Correspondent Zeke Miller to her office. She told
him that, at President Trump’s direction, the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) would no longer be permitted in the [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)

p. 9
      9
as part of the press pool until and unless [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) revised its [Stylebook](https://www.apstylebook.com/) to refer to the body of water
known for hundreds of years as the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. Leavitt provided no
other reason for the decision other than to compel the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) to change the language of its reporting,
nor did she object to any particular conduct by Miller or any other [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) journalist.
33. Leavitt’s proclamation followed an executive order [President Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) had issued
on January 20, 2025, renaming the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. Exec. Order No.
14172. By its own terms, the [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/restoring-names-that-honor-american-greatness/) applied only to those portions of the Gulf within
the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/). The body of water also borders [Mexico](https://www.gob.mx) and [Cuba](https://www.gob.cu/). It has been known as the
Gulf of Mexico for over 400 years and remains known internationally as the Gulf of Mexico.
34. On January 23, the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) announced that the organization would refer to the Gulf of
Mexico “by its original name while acknowledging the new name [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has chosen.”3
 The [AP](https://www.apnews.com/)
explained that, “[a]s a global news agency that disseminates news around the world, the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) must
ensure that place names and geography are easily recognizable to all audiences.” The [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) added
that it “regularly reviews its style guidance regarding name changes, in part to ensure its
guidance reflects common usage,” and would do so here. It also noted that the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) would “make
updates as needed.”
35. In the same guidance, the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) noted that [President Trump’s](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) January 20, 2025
[Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/restoring-names-that-honor-american-greatness/) had also renamed North America’s tallest mountain to Mount McKinley from
Denali, undoing a 2015 name change issued by [Secretary of the Interior](https://www.doi.gov/) Sally Jewell during the
[Obama Administration](obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/). See [Dep’t of the Interior Order No. 3337](http://www.doi.gov//document-library/secretary-order/3337-changing-name-mount-mckinley-denali) (Aug. 28, 2015). The [AP](https://www.apnews.com/)
announced that it would follow this name change because the mountain is entirely within the
[United States](https://www.usa.gov/) and therefore under the [federal government’s](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) renaming authority.

36. The [AP](https://www.apnews.com/), however, abided by its carefully considered standards decision when
Leavitt made her February 11, 2025 demand that, with respect to the Gulf, it must begin using
only the Gulf of America name.
37. Later on the afternoon of February 11, however, [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  staff barred the
[AP’s](https://www.apnews.com/) text journalist from attending a presidential executive order signing and press conference
with [Elon Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) in the [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), which was open to the press pool. The [AP’s](https://www.apnews.com/) photographer
was allowed to attend.
38. [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) Executive Editor Julie Pace published a statement that same day objecting to
the [White House’s](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) actions. Pace wrote that “[l]imiting our access to the [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) based on
the content of [AP’s](https://www.apnews.com/) speech not only severely impedes the public’s access to independent news, it
plainly violates the [First Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/).”4
39. That night, another [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) reporter was barred from an event in the [Diplomatic
Reception Room](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) that was open to the press pool, as the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) welcomed home an [American](https://www.usa.gov/)
freed in a prisoner exchange with [Russia](http://government.ru/). The [AP’s](https://www.apnews.com/) photographer was not barred.
40. On February 12, 2025, Pace sent a letter to [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  Chief of Staff Susan
Wiles, objecting to these denials of access, which “were plainly intended to punish the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) for the
content of its speech” in violation of the [AP’s](https://www.apnews.com/) constitutional rights. The [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) “strongly urge[d] the
[administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) to end this practice” and offered to meet to discuss the matter in person.5
41. Also on February 12, Leavitt defended the [White House’s](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) actions during a press
briefing and stated that the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) was telling “lies” by using the Gulf of Mexico name. That

afternoon, the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) was barred from an [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) press conference during the swearing-in of
[Director of National Intelligence](https://www.dni.gov/) [Tulsi Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence).
42. On February 13, 2025, the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) was barred from a [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  [East Room](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) press
conference held by [President Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and [Indian](https://www.india.gov.in/) [Prime Minister Narendra Modi](http://www.pmindia.gov.in/en/pms-profile/), which was open
to other members of the press pool and other journalists with [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  press credentials.
[AP](https://www.apnews.com/) reporter Miller had submitted an RSVP for the event but was barred from attending. At least
one journalist from another news organization who did not RSVP was provided access. The [East
Room](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is one of the largest event spaces at the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), and can accommodate dozens of
journalists, as it did for this event.
43. That same day, Pace issued a statement again objecting to the [AP’s](https://www.apnews.com/) “deeply
troubling” exclusion and “urg[ing] the [Trump administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) in the strongest terms to stop this
practice.” Pace wrote that “[t]his is now the third day [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) reporters have been barred from
covering the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)—first as a member of the pool, and now from a formal press
conference—an incredible disservice to the billions of people who rely on [The Associated Press](https://www.apnews.com/)
for nonpartisan news.”6
 Also on February 13, 2025, Pace sent an email to Wiles objecting again
to the [White House’s](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) actions against the AP.
44. On February 14, 2025, [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  Deputy Chief of Staff Taylor Budowich
publicly announced that, because the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) would not use the Gulf of America name, [AP](https://www.apnews.com/)
journalists were now indefinitely barred from “access to limited spaces, like the [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and
[Air Force One](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/air-force-one/).” Budowich stated that [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) “journalists and photographers will retain their

p. 12
      12
credentials to the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  complex.” Budowich’s statement further claimed that the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) had
a “commitment to misinformation” and published “irresponsible and dishonest reporting.”7
 That
same day, Pace sent another email to Wiles again objecting to the [White House’s](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) actions.
45. On February 15, 2025, [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller
suggested further punishing the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) by revoking its [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  access entirely.8
 While this has
not occurred to date, his statement further evidences the [White House’s](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) clear intent to target the
[AP](https://www.apnews.com/) for the content of its speech. The following day, February 16, Pace sent another email to
Wiles objecting to the continued denial of access for the AP.
46. On the morning of February 18, five days after receiving the [AP’s](https://www.apnews.com/) letter protesting
the [White House’s](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) actions, Wiles responded. Wiles wrote that “[t]here is no event that the
[Associated Press](https://www.apnews.com/) is being barred from covering,” a statement that is plainly false given the [AP’s](https://www.apnews.com/)
exclusion from [President Trump’s](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) press conference with [Prime Minister Modi](http://www.pmindia.gov.in/en/pms-profile/). Wiles also wrote
that the [White House’s](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) “view as to why we arrived in this point” is that “the influence” the [AP’s](https://www.apnews.com/)
“[Stylebook](https://www.apstylebook.com/) has acquired has been misused, and at times weaponized, to push a divisive and
partisan agenda.” Wiles further stated that, as to the Gulf of Mexico specifically, [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)
officials “of course[] recognize that this renaming may not formally apply yet internationally,”
but Wiles nevertheless insisted that “given the AP’s role, it should also appropriately make the
distinction as an American guideline.”
47. Later that same day, [President Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) confirmed that his Administration would
continue denying the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) access based on its journalism, remarking of the AP, “[w]e’re going to
keep them out until such time that they agree that it’s the Gulf of America.” The [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) then

lambasted the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/), stating that the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) “has been very, very wrong on the election, on [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and
the treatment of [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)” and that “they’re doing us no favors and I’m not doing them any
favors.” [President Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) made these statements at a [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) press conference from which
[AP](https://www.apnews.com/) reporters were barred, even though the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) had requested access from Leavitt and other
[White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) officials and from security staff on site at [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/).
48. On February 19, 2025, in a final effort to reach a resolution of this matter short of
litigation, Pace traveled to Miami, Florida, on one day’s notice to meet with Wiles. The meeting
did not result in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  ceasing its restrictions on the [AP’s](https://www.apnews.com/) access. Instead, Wiles
continued to insist that the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) must revise its [Stylebook](https://www.apstylebook.com/) to adopt Gulf of America without
qualification. Wiles informed Pace that she would discuss the matter with [President Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) that
evening and follow up with her, but to date, the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) has not heard further from Wiles.
49. On February 20, 2025, an [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) reporter and two [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) photographers were barred
from accessing a Black History Month reception held in the [East Room](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)—a large event that was
open to the press pool and other credentialed members of the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  press corps. That
evening, an [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) reporter and photographer were barred from joining the remainder of the press
pool in the [President’s](https;//www.whitehouse.gov/) motorcade to cover his attendance at a dinner hosted by the [Republican
Governors Association](https://whca.press/). An [AP Radio](https://www.apnews.com/)  reporter, selected by his colleagues as the designated
pooler for that format in the pool for events that day, was also barred from providing coverage of
the day’s events.
50. Speaking at the [Republican Governors Association](https://whca.press/) dinner, [President Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)
emphasized that the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  is “holding [the AP] out of any news conferences” because of
how the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) refers to the Gulf of Mexico, and he even predicted this very case, remarking that the

p. 14
      14
possibility of the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) prevailing in such a lawsuit “doesn’t matter” because the effort to coerce
the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) into using the government’s preferred words “is something we feel strongly about.”9
51. On information and belief, all other non-rotating, organizational members of the
press pool have, like the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/), continued to use the Gulf of Mexico name, while noting [President
Trump’s](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/restoring-names-that-honor-american-greatness/). The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  has not barred any of those other news
organizations from the press pool as a result of their expression, underscoring the
[Administration’s](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) particular animus toward and retaliation against the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/).
52. Since February 14, 2025, [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) print and photojournalists have remained barred
from the Oval Office, [Air Force One](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/air-force-one/), and other locations otherwise open to the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)
press pool, as well as other events that have been open to the broader [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  press corps.
53. The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  has not provided the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) with any formal notice of the reasons
for, formal opportunity to be heard regarding, or meaningful opportunity to challenge the [White
House’s](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) decision to bar the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) from the press pool, [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), [Air Force One](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/air-force-one/), and other
limited areas.
54. The [White House’s](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) indefinite denial of the AP’s access was based on the content
and perceived viewpoint of the [AP’s](https://www.apnews.com/) reporting and editorial decisions, and constituted
impermissible retaliation against the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) based on its constitutionally protected activity in ways
that would chill the speech of similarly situated reasonable individuals.

CLAIMS FOR RELIEF
Count I
Declaratory and Injunctive Relief:
Violation of the [Fifth Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-5/)
55. The [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) realleges and incorporates by reference all previous paragraphs as if fully
set forth herein.
56. Defendants’ decision to indefinitely ban the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) from “access to limited spaces,
like the [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and [Air Force One](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/air-force-one/)” open to members of the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  press pool,
violates the Due Process Clause of the [Fifth Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-5/) to the [U.S. Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/). Because the
[White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has made those spaces available to other members of the pool, it cannot
constitutionally deny the [AP’s](https://www.apnews.com/) access without due process of law, and cannot deny access so
arbitrarily or for anything other than legitimate, compelling reasons.
57. The [AP’s](https://www.apnews.com/) access as a member of the press pool to the [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), [Air Force One](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/air-force-one/),
and the other limited spaces—which the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  has now revoked indefinitely—is
protected by the [First](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/) and [Fifth](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-5/) Amendments. Being a member of the press pool and reporting
from these spaces has, for over a century, allowed the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) to effectively and timely report on the
[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), information which is critical to an informed public. The indefinite
denial of the [AP’s](https://www.apnews.com/) access hinders its ability to provide timely, accurate and nonpartisan reporting
on the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  to the thousands of global news outlets that republish the [AP’s](https://www.apnews.com/)
news reports and to billions of readers globally.
58. The [White House’s](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) decision to deny the [AP’s](https://www.apnews.com/) access was arbitrary. The AP](https://www.apnews.com/)
received no prior notice of the White House’s decision. Leavitt announced the decision verbally,
after it had been made, to [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) Chief [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  Correspondent Miller. The [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) received no
written notice of the White House’s decision.

p. 16
      16
59. Defendants did not provide to the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) any opportunity to challenge their decision
before it took effect, nor have Defendants provided to the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) any formal opportunity to
challenge it since that time. Instead, the Administration repeatedly has made clear that it intends
to continue barring the [AP’s](https://www.apnews.com/) access indefinitely unless the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) uses the [Administration’s](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)
preferred language.
60. As a result of Defendants’ actions, the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) has suffered and continues to suffer
irreparable harm.
Count II
Declaratory and Injunctive Relief:
Violation of the [First Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/)
61. The [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) realleges and incorporates by reference all previous paragraphs as if fully
set forth herein.
62. The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  has ordered the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) to use certain words in its coverage or else
be barred from accessing events open to the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  press pool, as direct retaliation for the
[AP’s](https://www.apnews.com/) speech. Defendants’ decision to bar the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) from reporting in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  press pool
and to deny the [AP’s](https://www.apnews.com/) access to the [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), [Air Force One](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/air-force-one/), and other limited areas, as well as
other events that have been open to the broader [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  press corps, violates the [First
Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/) to the [U.S. Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/). The [AP’s](https://www.apnews.com/) access to and reporting on the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  as a
member of the press pool, and the AP’s own editorial decisions about naming conventions, are
protected under the [First Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/).
63. Defendants have deprived the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) of its right as a member of the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)
press pool to access limited areas in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)  that have been opened to the press pool as
representatives of the press and public. This attempt to control speech has the impact of
depriving the thousands of global news outlets that republish the [AP’s](https://www.apnews.com/) news reports, and its

p. 17
      17
billions of readers around the world, from the [AP’s](https://www.apnews.com/) factual, timely and nonpartisan reporting on
the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).
64. Defendants have admitted that they acted against the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) based on their dislike of
the [AP’s](https://www.apnews.com/) use of the Gulf of Mexico name and its other editorial choices. The law does not allow
the government to control speech based on its likes and dislikes. Such dislike is not a compelling
reason to justify the infringement of the [AP’s](https://www.apnews.com/) [First Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/) rights, and it is not narrowly
tailored to achieve any compelling government interest.
65. Defendants’ actions against the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) expressly were taken because of the language
the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) uses in its reporting and [Stylebook](https://www.apstylebook.com/), constituting content- and viewpoint-based
discrimination.
66. Defendants’ actions against the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) were in retaliation for the [AP’s](https://www.apnews.com/) exercise of its
[First Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/)-protected rights of expression. The access denial was intended to have, and
has had, a chilling effect on the exercise of the [AP’s](https://www.apnews.com/) [First Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/) rights. Defendants’ acts
would chill, and have chilled, the speech of similarly situated reasonable people of ordinary
firmness.
67. Defendants’ access denial is also intended to compel the speech of the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/),
specifically to make the Gulf of America the primary term used in its reporting and [Stylebook](https://www.apstylebook.com/).
68. As a result of Defendants’ actions, the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) has suffered and continues to suffer
irreparable harm.
PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, the [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) respectfully requests that this Court:

p. 18
      18
a. Order the Defendants to immediately rescind their denial of the [AP’s](https://www.apnews.com/) access to the
[Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), [Air Force One](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/air-force-one/), and other limited spaces when such spaces are made open to other
