## [Trump Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt Drops Bombshell on White House Correspondents’ Association](https://www.mediaite.com/politics/karoline-leavitt-drops-bombshell-on-whca-by-announcing-white-house-is-taking-control-of-press-pool/)

Story by Zachary Leeman. February 26, 2025

Karoline Leavitt:

- “I’m proud to announce that we are going to give the power back to the people who read your papers, who watch television shows, and who listen to your radio stations. Moving forward, the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) press pool will be determined by the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) press team. Legacy outlets who have participated in the press pool for decades will still be allowed to join, fear not, but we will also be offering the privilege to well-deserving outlets who have never been allowed to share in this awesome responsibility. Just like we added a new media seat in this briefing room, legacy media outlets who have been here for years will still participate in the pool, but new voices are going to be welcomed in as well. As part of these changes, we will continue the rotation amongst the five major television networks to ensure the president’s remarks are heard far and wide around this world. We will add additional streaming services that reach different audiences than traditional cable and broadcast. This administration is shaking up [Washington](https://dc.gov/) in more ways than one. This is what we are elected to do. It is beyond time that they white house press operation reflects the American people in 2025, not 1925. A select group of D.C.-based journalists should no longer have a monopoly over the privilege of press access to service seat at this highly coveted table. Deciding which outlets make up the limited press pool on a day-to-day basis, the [white house](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) will restore power to the American people who President Trump was elected to serve.”

- The [White House Correspondents Association (WHCA)](https://whca.press/) can no longer assign journalists to cover [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/)
- [AP](https://www.apnews.com/) won't have First Amendment rights restored until Narch 20 hearing.
