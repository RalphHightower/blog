title: "Project 2025, Which Trump Claims He Knew Nothing About, Is Decimating Federal Government Like Massive Wildfires üî•" 
---


I assessed [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) as a fucking idiot in 2015. The [Federal Government](https://www.usa.gov/) is not a third-rate game show like *"The Apprentice"* where [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) barks ***"You're fired!"*** Civil servants are the backbone that provides services to citizens. 

There is no *silver* lining to this massive slash and burn of the Federal Government.

Unemployment will skyrocket, inflation will rise, stock markets will crash. 

It is in [Project 2025's](https://www.project2025.org/) to slash the civil servant workforce cutting services to Americans!
