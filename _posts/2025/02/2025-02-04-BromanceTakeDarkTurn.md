Less than two weeks into [Trump's](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) return, it's clear that [Elon Musk](https;//x.com/elonmusk/) has had an outsized and unusual role: helping [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) wage a war on his own federal government. [Musk](https;//x.com/elonmusk/) is not a federal employee and has no clearances, yet has already gained access to highly sensitive information at the [Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/) and [USAID](https://www.usaid.gov/). And those who have tried to stand in his way have either been put on leave or forced to resign. MSNBC’s Ayman Mohyeldin speaks with former Congressman Denver Riggleman and Democratic Strategist Julie Roginsky about how dangerous this is for U.S. democracy.
