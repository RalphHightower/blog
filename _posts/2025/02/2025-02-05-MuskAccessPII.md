MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell details the worst of [Donald Trump's](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) illegal actions as president that prove “we are not a nation of laws,” including giving [Elon Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/) the “domestic equivalent of the nuclear codes,” the keys to the [U.S. Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/).

All Your PII (Personal Identity Information) Are Belong to Us, is a paraphrase from an old internet meme, All Your Base Are Belong to Us, is an "Engrish" translation of a Japanese video game for a Sega game console: [All your base are belong to us - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_your_base_are_belong_to_us)

Post election 2016, I named the [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) 1.0 administration: "[The Apprentice: White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)". November 14, 2024, I gave [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) 2.0 administration: "[The Apprentice: White House – Wrecking Ball 2025](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)". [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and his henchmen are doing their damndest to destroy America!
