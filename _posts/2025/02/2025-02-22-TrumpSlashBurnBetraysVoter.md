The [Trump regime](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and DOGE are gutting the [IRS](https://www.irs.gov/), but who does that really support? Definitely not its employees who voted for him...and certainly not us!
- 7000 [IRS](https://www.irs.gov/) probationary employees laid-off. Wiping out collecting collections 4.8 billions 
- [Doge](https://doge.gov/) estimates dropping 
- .5% inflation up, largest increase 
- [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has accumulated more debt than all Presidents combined 
- government employees do a service
