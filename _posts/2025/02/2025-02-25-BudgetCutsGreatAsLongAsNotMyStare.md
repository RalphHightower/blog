## [Opinion / Cuts for thee, but not for me: Trumpians beg for DOGE exemptions - The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/02/25/republicans-doge-trump-musk/)

Opinion

*Have GOP lawmakers forgotten that they control spending?*

February 25, 2025

For my friends, everything. For my enemies, the law.

That’s an old diktat, usually attributed to an old Latin American dictator. But it could easily apply today, as cowardly [Trumpians](https://www.gop.com/) beg [President Donald Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) to spare them — and only them — from the [DOGE](https://www.doge.gov/) chainsaw.

**[Trumpians](https://www.gop.com/) Seek [DOGE](https://www.doge.gov/) Exemptions Amidst Major Budget Cuts**

In a recent development, [Trumpian lawmakers](https://www.gop.com/) have been appealing to [President Donald Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) to exempt them and their states from the severe budget cuts mandated by the [Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)](https://www.doge.gov/). This scenario seems reminiscent of the old saying, *"For my friends, everything. For my enemies, the law."*

The [Trump administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), with the assistance of [Elon Musk's](https://x.com/elonmusk/) [DOGE](https://www.doge.gov/), has been aggressively slashing funding for various critical government functions and services, including [flight safety programs](https://www.faa.gov/), [cancer research](https://www.nih.gov/), [bird-flu tracking](https://www.usda.gov/), [food assistance](https://www.fns.usda.gov/usda-food-and-nutrition-service), and [disaster aid](https://www.fema.gov/). However, instead of evaluating the broader implications of these cuts, some [Trumpians](https://www.gop.com/) are more concerned about their personal and regional impacts.

For instance, [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) anchor [Jesse Watters](https://www.foxnews.com/shows/jesse-watters-primetime) recently pleaded for a friend laid off by [DOGE](https://www.doge.gov/), considering him worthy of his [Pentagon position](https://www.defense.gov/), unlike other federal employees. Meanwhile, [GOP lawmakers](https://www.gop.com/), who have the authority to set [government spending](https://www.congress.gov/), seem hesitant to challenge [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) and [Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/) directly. Instead, they are seeking special exemptions for their constituencies.

[Senator Katie Boyd Britt (T-AL)](https://www.britt.senate.gov/) has publicly supported [Trump's](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) [budget-cutting efforts](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency-cost-efficiency-initiative/), stating that taxpayer money should be spent efficiently and accountably. However, she also lobbied [Health and Human Services](https://www.hhs.gov/) [Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) for an exemption to protect funding for the [University of Alabama at Birmingham](https://www.uab.edu/home/) and other institutions in her [state](https://www.alabama.gov/).

Similarly, [Senator Shelley Moore Capito (T-West Virginia)](https://www.capito.senate.gov/) successfully petitioned the [Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.epa.gov/) to unfreeze funding for [green school buses manufactured](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-over-185m-awards-clean-school-buses-across-west) in [her state](https://www.wv.gov/). Over in [Kansas](https://www.kansas.gov/), [Senator Jerry Moran](https://www.moran.senate.gov/) is working to restore an [international food aid program](https://www.usaid.gov/), which is crucial for [Kansas farmers](https://agriculture.ks.gov/).

Some Trumpian leaders are growing concerned about the potential impact of [funding cuts on disaster relief](https://www.fema.gov/) for their constituents. [Senator Thom Tillis (T-North Carolina)](https://www.tillis.senate.gov/) expressed support for [Trump's](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) approach to [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/), as long as it does not negatively affect [western North Carolina](https://www.wncrecovery.nc.gov/).

[Senator Susan Collins (T-MA)](https://www.collins.senate.gov/) has voiced her concerns about [DOGE's](https://www.doge.gov/) impact on her [state](https://www.maine.gov/), including [national parks](https://www.nps.gov/index.htm) and [biomedical research](https://www.nih.gov/). However, like her fellow [Trump Party](https://www.gop.com/) members, she supported the confirmation of [Trump's Cabinet nominees](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/) who are implementing these cuts. [Senator Lisa Murkowski (T-AK)](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/) is also advocating for the restoration of funds for her [state](https://www.alaska.gov/), describing the administration's responses as inadequate.

[Representative Nick Begich (T-AK0)](https://begich.house.gov/) claimed he was unaware of budget cuts affecting [Alaska](https://www.alaska.gov/) until he saw them on social media, despite being a member of the [House](https://www.house.gov/) [DOGE](https://www.doge.gov/) Caucus. This highlights a broader issue of lawmakers not fully utilizing their [constitutional powers](https://constitution.congress.gov/) to control [government spending](https://www.congress.gov/).

In summary, while [Trumpians](https://www.gop.com/) generally support budget cuts, many are seeking exemptions to protect their own states. This raises questions about the consistency and fairness of the [DOGE initiative](https://www.doge.gov/) and its potential long-term impacts on essential government services.
