title: "Fucking Idiots: Trump & Vance Shouting at Zelenskyy While He Tries To Educate Them About the Ukraine War History"

@RalphHightower: Gawd! What fucking assholes. First, it was absolutely wrong to have peace talks with the [US](https://www.usa.gov/), and [Russia](http://government.ru/) without [Ukraine's](https://www.gov.ua/) presence. [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) and [Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) have been in office for a little over a month and they're shouting "YouTube should be grateful.", "You're in a bad spot to bargain.", "This war would've been over in two weeks!" [Russia](http://government.ru/) attacked [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/) three years ago. [Russia](http://government.ru/) has control of [Ukraine's](https://www.gov.ua/) coast. They don't have any ports now. [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/) wants their land back!

## BREAKING: Trump tells Zelenskyy he's 'gambling with World War III' in tense exchange

Feb 28, 2025  [#Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) [#Zelenskyy](https://www.president.gov.ua/) [#JDVance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/)
[President Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/), [Ukrainian President Zelenskyy](https://www.president.gov.ua/) and [Vice President Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) had a tense exchange about the ongoing war with [Russia](http://government.ru/). [Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) asked [Zelenskyy](https://www.president.gov.ua/) if he has ever said "thank you" for U.S. aid and [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) clashed with him over what has been provided.
