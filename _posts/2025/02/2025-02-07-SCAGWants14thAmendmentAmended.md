### [Attorney General Alan Wilson defends Trump Birthright Citizenship order - South Carolina Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/news/attorney-general-alan-wilson-defends-trump-birthright-citizenship-order/)

FEB 03, 2025

[Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/) [Alan Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general/) defends Trump Birthright Citizenship order
(COLUMBIA, S.C.) - Attorney General [Alan Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general/) today joined [17 other states](https://republicanags.com/) in defending [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) Trump’s [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-meaning-and-value-of-american-citizenship/) that restores the original meaning and value of American citizenship while ending birthright citizenship and the loophole for birth tourism and illegal aliens.

In 2023, an estimated 225,000-250,000, or 7% of all births in the U.S. were to illegal aliens. The [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-meaning-and-value-of-american-citizenship/) comes in the shadow of record-breaking illegal crossings on the southern border under the [Biden-Harris administration](bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov), including convicted criminals, violent gang members, and suspected terrorists.

“The [14<sup>th</sup> Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-14/) was enacted to ensure that emancipated slaves were citizens. It was never meant to be a loophole so illegal aliens could have an anchor baby to allow the whole family to stay,” [Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/) [Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general/) said. 

Taxpayers are expected to foot the bill for these births through [Medicaid](https://www.medicaid.gov/), children’s health insurance, and healthcare for the accompanying family. Reports show that the lure of birthright citizenship has inspired some pregnant women to cross the southern border even the day before or the day of giving birth, with some going into labor while still wet from swimming across the Rio Grande River. 

The [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-meaning-and-value-of-american-citizenship/) eliminates the incentive for illegal immigration by reserving birthright citizenship for children born in the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) to American citizens or to legal noncitizens like lawful permanent residents. 

The [states](https://republicanags.com/) make the case that [President Trump’s](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-meaning-and-value-of-american-citizenship/) is constitutional and follows the original meaning of the 14th [Fourteenth Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-14/). The 14th [Fourteenth Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-14/) has a two-part test for granting American citizenship: 

1. Was the individual born or naturalized into the ](https://republicanags.com/)? 
2. Is that individual subject to the “jurisdiction” of the ](https://republicanags.com/)? 

The briefs describe how only children born to American citizens or legal noncitizens like lawful permanent residents pass both parts of the test.

### [Protecting The Meaning And Value Of American Citizenship – The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-meaning-and-value-of-american-citizenship/)

EXECUTIVE ORDER
January 20, 2025
By the authority vested in me as [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) by the [Constitution](constitution.congress.gov/) and the laws of the [United States of America](https://www.usa.gov/), it is hereby ordered:

Section 1.  Purpose.  The privilege of [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) citizenship is a priceless and profound gift.  The Fourteenth [Fourteenth Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-14/) states:  “All persons born or naturalized in the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/), and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) and of the State wherein they reside.”  That provision rightly repudiated the [Supreme Court of the United States’s](http://www.supremecourtus.gov/) shameful decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393 (1857), which misinterpreted the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/) as permanently excluding people of African descent from eligibility for [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) citizenship solely based on their race.

But the [Fourteenth Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-14/) has never been interpreted to extend citizenship universally to everyone born within the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/).  The [Fourteenth Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-14/) has always excluded from birthright citizenship persons who were born in the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) but not “subject to the jurisdiction thereof.”  Consistent with this understanding, the [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) has further specified through legislation that “a person born in the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/), and subject to the jurisdiction thereof” is a national and citizen of the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) at birth, [8 U.S.C. 1401](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title8-section1401&num=0&edition=prelim), generally mirroring the [Fourteenth Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-14/)’s text.

Among the categories of individuals born in the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) and not subject to the jurisdiction thereof, the privilege of United States citizenship does not automatically extend to persons born in the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/): 

(1) when that person’s mother was unlawfully present in the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) and the father was not a [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth, or (2) when that person’s mother’s presence in the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) at the time of said person’s birth was lawful but temporary (such as, but not limited to, visiting the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) under the auspices of the Visa Waiver Program or visiting on a student, work, or tourist visa) and the father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth.

Sec. 2.  Policy.  (a)  It is the policy of the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) that no department or agency of the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) government shall issue documents recognizing [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) citizenship, or accept documents issued by State, local, or other governments or authorities purporting to recognize [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) citizenship, to persons:  (1) when that person’s mother was unlawfully present in the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) and the person’s father was not a [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth, or (2) when that person’s mother’s presence in the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) was lawful but temporary, and the person’s father was not a [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth.

(b)  Subsection (a) of this section shall apply only to persons who are born within the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) after 30 days from the date of this order.

(c)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to affect the entitlement of other individuals, including children of lawful permanent residents, to obtain documentation of their [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) citizenship.

Sec. 3.  Enforcement.  (a)  The [Secretary of State](https://www.state.gov/), the [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/), the Secretary of [Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/), and the Commissioner of [Social Security](https://www.ssa.gov/) shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that the regulations and policies of their respective departments and agencies are consistent with this order, and that no officers, employees, or agents of their respective departments and agencies act, or forbear from acting, in any manner inconsistent with this order.

(b)  The heads of all executive departments and agencies shall issue public guidance within 30 days of the date of this order regarding this order’s implementation with respect to their operations and activities.

Sec. 4.  Definitions.  As used in this order:

(a)  “Mother” means the immediate female biological progenitor.

(b)  “Father” means the immediate male biological progenitor.

Sec. 5.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:

(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or

(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/), its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
