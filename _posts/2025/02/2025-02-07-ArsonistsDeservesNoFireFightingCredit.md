## [Opinion / Trump deserves no credit for putting out fires he ignites - The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/02/07/trump-trade-wars-canada-mexico-colombia/)

Opinion

*When the arsonist demands praise for his firefighting skills
[Donald Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is great at creating problems — and then pretending to fix them.*

- The article criticizes former [President Donald Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) for creating crises and then claiming victory when he addresses them.
- It highlights his trade disputes with [Canada](https://www.canada.ca/) and [Mexico](https://www.gob.mx/), accusing him of using bogus numbers to inflate the trade deficit and making confusing allegations about fentanyl smuggling.
- The piece argues that [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) lacks understanding of the facts and that the supposed concessions from [Mexico](https://www.gob.mx/) and [Canada](https://www.canada.ca/) were actions they were already taking.
- It mentions a similar situation with Colombia, where a deportation flight was refused due to [Trump's](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) aggressive approach, leading to economic uncertainty.
- The article contends that [Trump's](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) actions have damaged trust with international allies and hurt U.S. businesses.
- It also points out domestic issues, such as the false claim about [California's](https://www.ca.gov/) water supply and the negative impact of [Trump's](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) executive order on local farms.
- The author criticizes [Trump's](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) administration for purging and defunding important programs, causing disruptions in federal aid and research funding.

[Colombia](https://www.gov.co/) accepted commercial flights of deportees during the [Biden administration](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/). But when [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) insulted [Colombia](https://www.gov.co/), [Colombia](https://www.gov.co/) refused a military jet (needlessly aggressive and expensive) with deportee.

During the [Biden administration](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/), [Colombia](https://www.gov.co/)  regularly accepted commercial flights of deportees from the United States, without issue. But [Colombia](https://www.gov.co/) refused a deportation flight in January because [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) insulted our ally by sending a (needlessly aggressive and expensive) military jet instead. Tariffs and countertariffs were threatened; coffee prices spiked to record highs; and tariff threats were eventually withdrawn as both countries agreed to resume deportation flights.

There’s a principle known as “Chesterton’s Fence”: Don’t remove a fence until you know why it was put up in the first place. Perhaps it deserves a corollary: Don’t firebomb a fence, ever, even if you think it will win you some positive short-term press.
