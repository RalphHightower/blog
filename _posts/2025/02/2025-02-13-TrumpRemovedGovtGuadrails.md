## Kleptocracy and Autocracy: What‚Äôs the Diff?

@RalphHightower: *‚ÄúCan a kleptocracy also be an autocracy?‚Äù*

Copilot: Yes, a kleptocracy can indeed be an autocracy. Let me explain how these two concepts can intersect:

- **Kleptocracy**: This is a government where the rulers use their power to exploit the people and resources of the country for their own personal gain and wealth. Corruption is a hallmark of a kleptocracy, with officials using their positions to embezzle funds, accept bribes, and engage in other forms of corruption.

- **Autocracy**: This is a system of government where all the power is concentrated in the hands of a single individual or a small group. In an autocracy, the ruler has absolute control and is not accountable to any form of democratic process, such as elections or checks and balances.

When a single ruler or a small group holds power without accountability and uses their position to enrich themselves at the expense of the people, you can have a system that is both a kleptocracy and an autocracy. Some historical and contemporary regimes exhibit characteristics of both, with leaders maintaining control through authoritarian means while engaging in significant corruption.

@RalphHightower: *‚ÄúLet's continue with kleptocracy and autocracy. You mentioned historical and contemporary regimes. Can you provide references to both?‚Äù*

Copilot: Sure! Here are some examples of both historical and contemporary kleptocracies and autocracies:

### Historical Examples:
1. **Mobutu Sese Seko in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo)**: Mobutu ruled Zaire from 1965 to 1997 and was known for his kleptocratic regime, where he embezzled billions of dollars from the country's resources [43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.britannica.com/topic/kleptocracy?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1").
2. **Saddam Hussein in Iraq**: Saddam Hussein's regime (1979-2003) was marked by widespread corruption and the misuse of state resources for personal gain [43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.britannica.com/topic/kleptocracy?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleptocracy?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2").
3. **Muammar Gaddafi in Libya**: Gaddafi's rule (1969-2011) was characterized by significant corruption and the concentration of power in his hands [43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.britannica.com/topic/kleptocracy?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleptocracy?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2").

### Contemporary Examples:
1. **Venezuela under Nicol√°s Maduro**: The Maduro regime has been accused of kleptocracy, with allegations of widespread corruption and embezzlement of state funds [43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.britannica.com/topic/kleptocracy?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleptocracy?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2").
2. **Russia under Vladimir Putin**: Putin's government has been described as both autocratic and kleptocratic, with significant corruption and the concentration of power in his hands [43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.britannica.com/topic/kleptocracy?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleptocracy?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2").
3. **Equatorial Guinea under Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo**: Obiang has been in power since 1979 and his regime is known for its kleptocratic practices, including the embezzlement of state funds [43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.britannica.com/topic/kleptocracy?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleptocracy?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2").

These examples illustrate how kleptocracy and autocracy can often go hand in hand, with leaders using their unchecked power to enrich themselves at the expense of their citizens.

## [Trump takes aim at agencies that police wrongdoing, protect federal workers - The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/13/trump-firings-watchdogs/)

*The president summarily fired and replaced top officials at five watchdog offices in an apparent attempt to consolidate power over the sprawling federal bureaucracy.*

February 13, 2025 at 6:56 a.m. EST

By Colby Itkowitz, Yvonne Wingett Sanchez and Olivia George

- **[President Donald Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)** has fired and replaced top officials at five watchdog offices, aiming to consolidate power over the federal bureaucracy.
- The firings included heads of the **[Office of Government Ethics](https://www.oge.gov/), the [Office of Special Counsel](https://osc.gov/), the [U.S. Agency for International Development's](https://www.usaid.gov/) inspector general, the [Merit Systems Protection Board](https://www.mspb.gov/), and the [Federal Labor Relations Authority](https//:www.flra.gov/)**.
- Critics argue that these actions create a lawless environment and undermine existing mechanisms to root out government waste, fraud, and abuse.
- Concerns are raised about the appointment of **Douglas A. Collins** to lead multiple agencies, questioning his ability to manage these roles effectively.
- Legal challenges are being made against [Trump's](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) actions, with some officials suing for wrongful termination.
- Critics liken the current situation to the [Nixon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon) presidency, warning of the potential erosion of accountability and the establishment of an authoritarian regime.
- Advocates for a stronger federal government express alarm over the implications of these firings for government oversight and the protection of federal employees.

[Office of Government Ethics](https://www.oge.gov/):

- polices high-ranking officials suspected of violating conflict-of-interest rules.

[Office of Special Counsel](https://osc.gov/):

- investigates whistleblower reports from government workers ‚Äî and protects those workers from retribution.

Inspector Generals[^81]:

- serves as an independent auditor to the agency that they are assigned to and report on findings of waste, fraud, and abuse.
[^81]: [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [had fired 18 Inspector Generals earlier]({% link _posts/2025/01/2025-01-26-IGsFiredFridayNightMassacre.md %}).

[Merit Systems Protection Board](https://www.mspb.gov/):

- hears appeals to firings and other disciplinary actions against federal employees.

[Federal Labor Relations Authority](https//:www.flra.gov/):

- protects federal employee unions from actions taken against them.

[Max Stier](https://ourpublicservice.org/staff/max-stier-2/), president and chief executive of the [Partnership for Public Service](https://ourpublicservice.org/)[^91]:

[^91]: a nonpartisan group that advocates for a stronger federal government.

- ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs creating a lawless environment in the federal government. There‚Äôs no truth to the idea that what they‚Äôre trying to do is make the system work better.‚Äù

Kevin Owen, an attorney who works on worker protection laws:

- ‚ÄúTheir plan is quite obviously to remove whoever they want if they disagree with them, even if it‚Äôs over political reasons, and make them sue,‚Äù adding that the firings mark an escalation in the [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) administration‚Äôs ‚Äúassault‚Äù on the federal workforce.

Walter M. Shaub Jr., a former director of the [Office of Government Ethics](https://www.oge.gov/):

- ‚ÄúThat man (Collins) is running a 400,000-employee federal agency. He‚Äôs not going to have time to spend all day the way the director of the [Office of Government Ethics](https://www.oge.gov/) does, reviewing financial disclosure reports and ethics agreements.‚Äù

[Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)‚Äôs actions already face challenges, primarily around the question of whether he is defying federal law intended to protect government workers and, in some cases, agency heads from arbitrary or politically motivated dismissals.

- Hampton Dellinger, the head of the [Office of Special Counsel](https://osc.gov/) who was fired last Friday in a one-sentence email sent ‚Äúon behalf‚Äù of [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), sued the [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) administration on Monday, saying his termination was illegal because it violated a law that shields the leaders of independent agencies from removal by the president, ‚Äúexcept in cases of neglect of duty, malfeasance or inefficiency.‚Äù A federal judge issued a temporary stay allowing him to keep his position in the interim as the case proceeds.

- Cathy Harris also sued, on Tuesday, after [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) fired her the previous day from her perch atop [Merit Systems Protection Board](https://www.mspb.gov/), which hears appeals to firings and other disciplinary actions against federal employees.

- The [Office of Government Ethics](https://www.oge.gov/) announced Monday on its website that [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) had terminated its director, David Huitema. Like Dellinger, Huitema was confirmed by the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) last year to a five-year term. [Congressional](https;//www.congress.gov/) [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) had implored Huitema to open an investigation into possible conflicts of interest involving [Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/) due to his billions of dollars in government contracts.

- Susan Tsui Grundmann, chairwoman of the [Federal Labor Relations Authority](https//:www.flra.gov/), which protects federal employee unions from actions taken against them, also received her notice of termination earlier this week.

The dismissals come on the heels of [Trump's](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) mass firing of [18 inspectors general]({% link _posts/2025/01/2025-01-26-IGsFiredFridayNightMassacre.md %}) working within government agencies to identify waste and abuse. Inspectors general have fewer protections and can be removed by the president without cause, but [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) is supposed to receive at least 30 days‚Äô notice of a termination. Several of those fired in the latest round have sued the administration and said they are confident of their legal recourse.

Some critics likened the current pace of firings to the atmosphere during the presidency of [Richard M. Nixon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon), who during the [Watergate](https://www.archives.gov/research/investigations/watergate) scandal in 1973 infamously ordered the firing of special prosecutor Archibald Cox, the lead investigator of the president‚Äôs role in the break-in. Cox had refused [Nixon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon)‚Äôs request to drop a subpoena of his White House tape recordings. But top Justice Department officials in turn refused to fire Cox, resigning instead, in an episode that became known as the Saturday Night Massacre and that contributed to the filing of impeachment charges against [Nixon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon) 10 days later.

Don Fox, a former general counsel of the [Office of Government Ethics](https://www.oge.gov/) and a former acting director of the office who worked with both the [George W. Bush](https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/president/) and [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) administrations, said the removals by [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) **‚Äúwould take us back to the [Nixon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon) days and an imperial presidency, and when the law and what it meant was whatever [Nixon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon)‚Äôs White House said it was. There really were no checks and balances.‚Äù**

Firing federal workers is a huge piece of [Trump's](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) agenda to shrink the federal government. On Tuesday, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) signed an executive order telling agencies to prepare for ‚Äúlarge-scale reductions.‚Äù [Elon Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/), the tech billionaire who is leading the [U.S. DOGE Service](https://doge.gov/), also known as the [Department of Government Efficiency](https://doge.gov/), was by his side.

The implication for firing these watchdogs is a ‚Äúcatastrophic end‚Äù of accountability inside the executive branch, Shaub:

- ‚ÄúPurging the federal government is the **first step to authoritarianism so there will be ‚Äúno one left to say, ‚ÄòI won‚Äôt follow this illegal order,‚Äô and no one left to point out that ‚Äòthis is illegal,‚Äô and no one left to blow the whistle on the illegality.‚Äù**

Shaub said his worries extend beyond what [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is doing within the [executive branch](https://www.whitehouse.gov/); he is also flouting laws passed by [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) and hinting at defying the courts.

- ‚ÄúOnce you lose all of these guardrails, it‚Äôs all over. There is nothing similar to a republic left.‚Äù
