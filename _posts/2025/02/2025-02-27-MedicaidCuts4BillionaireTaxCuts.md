[Donald Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) and [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Trumpians](https://www.gop.com/) just pushed through a multi-trillion-dollar budget that hands massive tax cuts to the ultra-wealthy while slashing [Medicaid](https://www.medicaid.gov/), [Social Security](https://www.ssa.gov/), and essential programs for millions of Americans.
