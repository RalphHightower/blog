House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-NY, alongside House Democratic Caucus leadership hosted a press conference, where they announced a plan to introduce a bill titled the Taxpayer Data Protection Act, with the purpose "to shield the American people from this out of control power grab permanently, and to make sure that the financial, personal, medical and confidential information of the American people is protected," as stated by Jeffries.
