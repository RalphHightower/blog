## [Musk's DOGE commission gains access to sensitive Treasury payment systems: AP sources / AP News](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-elon-musk-doge-treasury-5e26cc80fcb766981cea56afd57ae759)

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Department of Government Efficiency, run by [President Donald Trump's](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) billionaire adviser and [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) CEO Elon Musk, has gained access to sensitive [Treasury](https://www.treasury.gov/) data including [Social Security](https://www.ssa gov/) and [Medicare](https://www.cms.gov/) customer [payment systems](https://fiscal.treasury.gov/), according to two people familiar with the situation.

The move by [DOGE](https://doge.gov/), a [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) administration task force assigned to find ways to fire federal workers, cut programs and slash federal regulations, means it could have wide leeway to access important taxpayer data, among other things.

The New York Times first reported the news of the group’s access of the massive [federal payment system](https://fiscal.treasury.gov/). The two people who spoke to The Associated Press spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

The highest-ranking [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) on the [Senate Finance Committee](https://www.finance.senate.gov/), [Ron Wyden](https://www.wyden.senate.gov/) of [Oregon](https://www.oregon.gov/), on Friday sent a letter to [Trump's](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) Treasury Secretary [Scott Bessen](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) expressing concern that “officials associated with Musk may have intended to access these [payment systems](http://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/) to illegally withhold payments to any number of programs.”

“To put it bluntly, these [payment systems](http://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/) simply cannot fail, and any politically motivated meddling in them risks severe damage to our country and the economy,” [Wyden](https://www.wyden.senate.gov/) said.

The news also comes after [Treasury’s](https://www.tresuary.gov/) acting Deputy Secretary David Lebryk resigned from his position at Treasury after more than 30 years of service. The Washington Post on Friday reported that Lebryk resigned his position after Musk and his [DOGE](https://doge.gov/) organization requested access to sensitive Treasury data.


“The [Fiscal Service](http://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/) performs some of the most vital functions in government,” Lebryk said in a letter to [Treasury](https://www.tresuary.gov/) employees sent out Friday. “Our work may be unknown to most of the public, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t exceptionally important. I am grateful for having been able to work alongside some of the nation’s best and most talented operations staff.”

The letter did not mention a [DOGE](https://doge.gov/) request to access Treasury payments.

Musk on Saturday responded to a post on his social media platform [X](https://x.com/) about the departure of Lebryk: “The [@DOGE](https://doge.gov/) team discovered, among other things, that payment approval officers at [Treasury](https://www.tresuary.gov/) were instructed always to approve payments, even to known fraudulent or terrorist groups[^91]. They literally never denied a payment in their entire career. Not even once.”

**He did not provide proof of this claim.[^92]**

[^91]: @RalphHightower: That’s fucking bullshit! 
[^92]: @RalphHightower: Musk has learned to lie like [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). Just make up shit to say and 49% of the nation will believe you.

[DOGE](https://doge.gov/) was originally headed by Musk and former [Trumpian](https://www.gop.com/) presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, who jointly vowed to cut billions from the federal budget and usher in “mass headcount reductions across the federal bureaucracy.”

Ramaswamy has since left [DOGE](https://doge.gov/) as he mulls a run for governor of [Ohio](https://www.ohio.gov/).
