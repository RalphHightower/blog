title: 'My Dumb State South Carolina: South Carolina's Attorney General Weaponizes State Government To Persecute Trump's Perceived Enemy, Dr. Anthony Fauci, For His COVID-19 Pandemic Response"
---


## [South Carolina's](https://www.sc.gov/) [Attorney General](https://.www.scag.gov) [Alan Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general/) Is The Most Hyper Partisan Attorney General

[South Carolina's](https://www.sc.gov/) [Attorney General](https://.www.scag.gov) [Alan Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general/) is joining other Trumpian states attorneys general to persecute[^11] Dr. Anthony Fauci since [President Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov) issued a pardon to Dr. Fauci for his leadership at the [National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)](http://www.niaid.nih.gov/) during the COVID-19 pandemic which started with the [Trump #45 presidency](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). The Trumpian attorneys general have to carry on the persecution of a retired epidemiologist since Dr. Fauci is protected from [Trump #47](https://www whitehouse.gov/)

FEB 05, 2025
(COLUMBIA, S.C.) – [South Carolina](https://www.sc.gov/) [Attorney General](https://www scag.gov) [Alan Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general/) is leading a coalition of state attorneys general in an investigation into Dr. Anthony Fauci’s role in the COVID-19 pandemic response, demanding accountability for alleged mismanagement, misleading statements, and suppression of scientific debate. In a letter to Speaker of the House [Mike Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) and Senate Majority Leader [John Thune](https://www.thune.senate.gov/), the attorneys general commend ongoing Congressional efforts to uncover misconduct and request state-level cooperation in pursuing any violations of state laws.

“[President Biden](bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov)’s blanket pardon of Dr. Fauci is a shameful attempt to prevent accountability,” said [Attorney General Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general/). “If any of these findings indicate violations of state laws, we are fully prepared to take appropriate action to ensure justice is served.”

The letter follows the release of the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic’s final report, which details widespread failures and potential misconduct by high-ranking government officials, including Dr. Fauci. The report highlights misleading public statements regarding COVID-19’s origins, mismanagement of [National Institutes of Health (NIH)](https://www.nih.gov/) funding, and efforts to suppress scientific discussions about vaccine risks.

Key Findings from the Congressional Report:

- Origins of COVID-19 – Evidence suggests Dr. Fauci worked to discredit the “lab leak” theory despite mounting evidence supporting it.
- Misleading Congress on [NIH](https://www.nih.gov/) Funding – Dr. Fauci allegedly provided false testimony regarding [NIH](https://www.nih.gov/)-funded gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
- [NIH](https://www.nih.gov/) Oversight Failures – The [NIH](https://www.nih.gov/) reportedly mismanaged taxpayer funds by failing to properly oversee grants to EcoHealth Alliance, which funneled funding to the Wuhan lab.
- Suppression of Scientific Dissent – Prominent scientists who raised concerns about vaccine risks were allegedly silenced, limiting public awareness of potential side effects.
- Despite these findings, former [President Joe Biden](bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov) issued a sweeping pardon for Dr. Fauci, shielding him from federal prosecution for any offenses committed during his tenure. However, the attorneys general assert that this federal pardon does not prevent state-level legal action.

The attorneys general have requested that [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) provide them with any relevant findings that could lead to state investigations and potential prosecutions. They reaffirm their commitment to upholding public trust, ensuring transparency, and preventing similar failures in future public health crises.

The attorneys general urge Congressional leaders to continue their investigative efforts and ensure that all responsible parties are held accountable at both federal and state levels.

To: [Congressional Leadership](https://www.congress.gov/)

The Honorable [Mike Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/)
Speaker of the House
[United States House of Representatives](https://www.house.gov)
568 Cannon House Office Building
Washington, D.C. 20003

The Honorable [John Thune](https://www.thune.senate.gov/)
Majority Leader
[United States Senate](https://www.senate.gov/)

**Re: An inquiry into the response to COVID-19**

Dear Speaker [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) and Majority Leader [Thune](https://www.thune.senate.gov/):

We, the undersigned Attorneys General, write to commend your work to promote transparency and accountability in studying the response to the COVID-19 Pandemic[^1]. As part of your continued efforts in holding malign actors accountable for their actions arising out of the Pandemic, if you believe that further findings or direct evidence that suggests there may have been any violation of state laws, please include us in any actions taken so that we may evaluate state-level courses of action. Although former [President Biden](bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov) attempted to shield potential bad actors—like Dr. Anthony Fauci—from accountability via preemptive pardons, we are confident that state laws may provide a means to hold all actors accountable for their misconduct.

With respect to your work thus far, we read with great interest the findings of the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic.[^1] We commend Chairman Brad Wenstrup and the subcommittee for their excellent work in exposing the fraud, waste, and abuse that plagued the pandemic response. Equally as important, we commend the subcommittee for its attempt to hold government actors accountable, highlighting misrepresentations, evasions, and potential deceitfulness by high-ranking government officials.

[^1]: After Action Review of the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Lessons Learned and a Path Forward, H. Select Sub
Comm. On the Coronavirus Pandemic, H. Comm. On Oversight & Accountability, available at https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/12.04.2024-SSCP-FINAL-REPORT.pdf (Dec. 4, 2024).

As you are doubtlessly aware, the Subcommittee’s report delineated several key area where Dr. Fauci and others engaged in potential wrongdoing or misconduct:

**(1) COVID-19’s Origins:** The report suggests high ranking medical officials may have misled the public about COVID-19’s origins in at least two ways. First, the report indicates Dr. Fauci “prompted” a “Proximal Origin” theory of COVID-19’s origins, which was meant to disprove a “lab leak” theory. As we all now know, and as the report found, the weight of the evidence increasingly supports a lab leak hypothesis, and Dr. Fauci’s potential involvement in attempting to discredit that hypothesis is troubling. Any deliberate manipulation or suppression of alternative hypotheses could have delayed critical understanding of and responses to the Pandemic, with dire consequences for global health. Second, the report indicates that Dr. Fauci may have misled [Congress](https://www.congress.gov) about the [National Institutes of Health's](https://www.nih.gov/) funding of gain-of-function research at the [Wuhan Institute of Virology](http://english.whiov.cas.cn/). In responding to questioning from Senator [Rand Paul](https://www.paul.senate.gov/) before the
[U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions](http://www.help.senate.gov/), Dr. Fauci categorically denied that such funding was occurring three times. The Subcommittee confirmed that such research was indeed funded through the EcoHealth Alliance, directly contradicting Dr. Fauci's statements. This discrepancy not only raises questions about the integrity of his testimony but also about the broader implications for scientific integrity and public trust. The possibility of perjury or at least a significant lack of transparency demands attention.

**(2) [NIH](https://www.nih.gov/) Oversight Failures:** The report notes a significant lapse in the oversight of [NIH](https://www.nih.gov/) grants, particularly those awarded to EcoHealth Alliance. These grants facilitated gainof-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology under conditions that were not adequately monitored, directly implicating Dr. Fauci’s leadership in potential mismanagement or negligence. Indeed, the multitudes of findings from Congress show that American tax dollars went directly to this research without proper scrutiny from the [NIH](https://www.nih.gov/).

**(3) Public Health Policy Decisions:** The report emphasizes how these actions, among others, have contributed to a profound erosion of public trust in health institutions. The need for accountability is not just about correcting past oversights, but also about ensuring that future public health crises are met with policies that are transparent, evidence-based, and trustworthy. For example, Dr. Fauci led a deliberate campaign to stifle the voices of premier health scholars regarding the lack of adequate testing of vaccines. This subsequently siloed crucial information from the public that may have led to more public awareness concerning the risks of myocarditis and pericarditis among young adult males; the verified increased risk of blood clots in women; and the long-term effects vaccines had on fertility. The notion of “trusting the science” not only was grotesquely false, but was the very definition of propaganda that contributed to serious vaccine injuries—and in some cases, death.

Despite these serious findings, former [President Biden](bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov) issued a sweeping full and unconditional pardon for Dr. Fauci for “any offenses which he may have committed or taken part in during the period of time from January 1, 2014 through the date” of the pardon. The pardon purports to apply to any offenses arising from his service as Director of the [National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)](http://www.niaid.nih.gov/), as a member of the [White House](https:www.whitehouse.gov/) Coronavirus Task Force or the [White House](https:www.whitehouse.gov/) COVID-19 Response Team, or as Chief Medical Advisor to the President. To say we are troubled by the scope and timing of the pardon—on the heels of the Subcommittee’s Final Report—would be a gross understatement. To ensure that former [President Biden](bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov)’s shameful pardon does not frustrate accountability, we urge Congress to consider using all available tools at its disposal. Certainly, one potential tool at our disposal is the referral of any pertinent findings to state officials. As you are aware, a pardon by former [President Biden](bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov) does not extend to preclude state-level investigations or legal proceedings. As state Attorneys General, we possess the authority to address violations of state law or breaches of public trust. We are fully committed to investigating any malfeasance that may have occurred to the fullest extent of our authority and are prepared to collaborate with you in further efforts. Our current capabilities may be somewhat limited, and thus, your cooperation would be invaluable. You are uniquely positioned to assist us by providing us with information that could outline potential courses of action under state law, should they exist. If possible, please furnish us with the necessary details so that we may make informed decisions aimed at holding malign actors accountable. Thank you for your attention to this matter.
