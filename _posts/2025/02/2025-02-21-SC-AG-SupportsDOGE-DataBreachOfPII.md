## [Attorney General Alan Wilson defends DOGE to protect taxpayer dollars - South Carolina Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/news/attorney-general-alan-wilson-defends-doge-to-protect-taxpayer-dollars/)

FEB 14, 2025

[Attorney General]() [Alan Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general/) defends [DOGE]() to protect taxpayer dollars
(COLUMBIA, S.C.) – [South Carolina]() [Attorney General]() [Alan Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general/) today joined 19 other states in defending [President Trump’s administration]() against politically-motivated lawsuits attempting to stop his team from protecting taxpayer dollars.

When the American people elected [President Trump]() in a decisive victory, they also voted for his America First agenda. [President Trump]() got straight to work by directing his [Department of Government Efficiency employees]() to investigate and cut billions of dollars in federal waste, fraud, and abuse. President Trump’s political opponents are now suing to block his team from accessing federal databases with information needed to eliminate federal fraud.

“It was the [Biden administration]() that estimated there’s between $233 billion and $521 billion in federal government waste, fraud, and abuse, and [President Trump]() is combatting that and saving taxpayers’ money,” [Attorney General]() [Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general/) said. “While that should be a bipartisan effort, the other side has filed a lawsuit to undermine the President’s authority to manage the executive branch.”

The states make the case that Article II of the [Constitution]() grants [President Trump]() the authority to direct executive branch agencies. The [states]() urge the court to let [President Trump’s administration]() continue doing its job to eliminate federal fraud and waste.

[Attorney General]() [Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general/) is also actively supporting state [DOGE]() efforts to investigate waste fraud and abuse at the state level.
