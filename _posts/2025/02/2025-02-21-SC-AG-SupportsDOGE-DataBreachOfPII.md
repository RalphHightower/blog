## [Attorney General Alan Wilson defends DOGE to protect taxpayer dollars - South Carolina Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/news/attorney-general-alan-wilson-defends-doge-to-protect-taxpayer-dollars/)

FEB 14, 2025

[Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/) [Alan Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general/) defends [DOGE](https://doge.gov/) to protect taxpayer dollars
(COLUMBIA, S.C.) ‚Äì [South Carolina](https://www.sc.gov/) [Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/) [Alan Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general/) today joined [19 other states](https://republicanags.com/) in defending [President Trump‚Äôs administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) against politically-motivated lawsuits attempting to stop his team from protecting taxpayer dollars.

When the American people elected [President Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) in a decisive victory[^21], they also voted for his America First agenda. [President Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) got straight to work by directing his [Department of Government Efficiency employees](https://www.scag.gov/) to investigate and cut billions of dollars in federal waste, fraud, and abuse. [President Trump‚Äôs](https://www.whitehouse.gov) political opponents are now suing to block his team from accessing federal databases with information needed to eliminate federal fraud.

[^21]: @RalphHightower: 2024 was not a decisive victory or a mandate. [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) did not get 50% of the vote. His margin of victory was less than 1.5%, 1.48% to be exact; although he did pick up nine more electoral college votes from 2016. Tables are provided from the [Federal Election Commission (FEC)](https://www.fec.gov/) above the footnotes.

‚ÄúIt was the [Biden administration](bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) that estimated there‚Äôs between \$233 billion and \$521 billion in federal government waste, fraud, and abuse, and [President Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is combatting that and saving taxpayers‚Äô money,‚Äù [Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/) [Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general/) said. ‚ÄúWhile that should be a bipartisan effort[^31], the [other side](https://www.dems.org/) has filed a lawsuit to undermine the [President‚Äôs](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) authority to manage the executive branch.‚Äù

[^31]: @RalphHightower: No, the [Democratic Attorneys General](https://www.dems.org/) recognize and acknowledge that protecting Americans Personal Identifiable Information (PII) from [DOGE employees](https://doge.gov/) without security clearances and background checks is more important than implementing [Trump‚Äôs](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) Wrecking Ball in his destruction of America.

The [states](https://republicanags.com/) make the case that Article II of the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/) grants [President Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) the authority to direct executive branch agencies. The [states](https://republicanags.com/) urge the court to let [President Trump‚Äôs administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) continue doing its job to eliminate federal fraud and waste.

[Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/) [Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general/) is also actively supporting state [DOGE](https://www.scag.gov/) efforts to investigate waste fraud and abuse at the state level.
