[President Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) spent his day calling the [Education Department](https://www.ed.gov/) a con job, telling America that [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/) would be visiting sometime soon, and seeing his new [DNI](https://dni.gov/) [Tulsi Gabbard]() sworn in. Plus, big news for the [Trump administration's](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) plan to offer buyouts to 2 million federal employees. Ahmed Baba, Evan McMorris-Santoro, and Allan Smith join Stephanie Ruhle for The 11th Hour Nightcap.
5% general attrition. [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/) not getting [NATO membership](https://www.nato.int/), not getting land back.
