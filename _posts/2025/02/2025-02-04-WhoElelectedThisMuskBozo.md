## [Musk intensifies government spending attack with push to cut all regulations / Trump administration / The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/04/musk-regulation-spending)

[Elon Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/) has proposed a “wholesale removal of regulations” in an intensification of his crusade to slash US federal government spending.

On a call aired on [X](https://x.com/), the social media platform he owns, the multibillionaire entrepreneur said regulations should be “gone” as vocal opposition grew against his mission as [Donald Trump's](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) enforcer as the head of a newly created “department of government efficiency” (Doge).

“Regulations, basically, should be default gone,” [Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/) said in call joined by Vivek Ramaswamy, until recently the joint head of Doge, and two [Trumpian](https://www.gop.com/) [senators](https://www.senate.gov/), [Joni Ernst (D-IA)](https://www.ernst.senate.gov/) and [Mike Lee (R-UT)](https://www.lee.senate.gov/).

“Not default there, default gone. And if it turns out that we missed the mark on a regulation, we can always add it back in.”

"[Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/) has boasted of killing off [USAid](http://www.usaid.gov/), the government’s conduit of international aid programmes, calling it an “evil” “criminal organisation” and saying he would feed it into “the wood chipper”. Thousands of staff members have been placed on unpaid furlough. [Marco Rubio](https://www.state.gov/biographies/marco-rubio/), the [US secretary of state](https://www.state.gov/biographies/marco-rubio/), cast some confusion on that boast by saying during a trip to Central America that he was now in charge of the agency, increasing the likelihood that [USAid](http://www.usaid.gov/) could be combined with the US state department.

[Musk's](https://x.com/elonmusk/) team has also gained access to the office of personnel management, the federal government’s human resources agency, allowing them to view employment records, while [Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/) claims to have cancelled up to 50% of [federal building contracts](https://www.gsa.gov/) for underused [office space](https://www.gsa.gov/).

The Doge team intends to insert artificial intelligence tools into the government computer systems to assess contracts and identify cuts, the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes/) reported.

With critics complaining that [Musk's](https://x.com/elonmusk/) multiplicity of government contracts from his various businesses created conflicts of interest, even [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) felt driven to tell reporters that he did not have unlimited power and could only act with his approval.

“[Elon](https://x.com/elonmusk/) can’t do and won’t do anything without our approval. And we’ll give him the approval where appropriate; where not appropriate, we won’t,” he told reporters in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). “If there’s a conflict, then we won’t let him get near it.”

[Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)s have accused [Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/) of flagrantly violating the law and “unconstitutional interference”.

“[Elon Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/), you may have illegally seized power over the [financial payment systems](http://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/) of the [United States Department of Treasury](https://www.tresuary.gov/), but you don’t control the money of the American people. The [United States Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) does that,” [Jaime Raskin (D-MD8)](https://raskin.house.gov/), the ranking [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) on the [House of Representatives’](https://www.house.gov/)
[judiciary committee](https://judiciary.house.gov/), said outside [USAid’s headquarters](http://www.usaid.gov/) on Monday.

“We don’t have a fourth branch of government called [Elon Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/) and that’s going to become real clear.”

Progressive groups were due to stage a “nobody elected [Elon](https://x.com/elonmusk/)” rally outside the [US treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/) headquarters on Tuesday."
