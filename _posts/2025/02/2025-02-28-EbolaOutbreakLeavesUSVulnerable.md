[Elon Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk), [Donald Trump's](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) top campaign contributor, made a lighthearted joke about his federal workforce cuts damaging the [U.S.](https://www.usa.gov/) ability to guard against an Ebola outbreak. Despite [Musk's](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) assurances that any damage done was quickly remedied, experts insist the cuts continue to leave the [U.S.](https://www.usa.gov/) unprepared. Dr. Craig Spencer, an emergency room doctor and Ebola survivor, talks with Rachel Maddow about what [Musk's](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) cut have really done.
