## [Trump Signs Order to Kill Federal Agency Investigating Tesla](https://www.latintimes.com/trumps-signs-order-kill-federal-agency-investigating-tesla-574989)

Story by Allison Walker. February 7, 2025

Afederal probe into alleged workplace discrimination at Tesla, including "N-word, swastikas, threats, and nooses, on desks," has been abruptly axed by an executive order signed by President Donald Trump on Jan. 21.

The order dismantled the Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), the agency responsible for enforcing equal employment laws among federal contractors.

With the agency nearly defunct, employees are left with grunt work; informing businesses that discrimination audits have halted and outstanding fines won't be collected, according to the San Francisco Standard.

Tesla was hit with a lawsuit in September 2023 from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which accused the company of fostering a workplace where Black employees faced ongoing harassment and retaliation.

"Black employees at Tesla's Fremont, California manufacturing facilities have routinely endured racial abuse, pervasive stereotyping, and hostility as well as epithets such as variations of the N-word, 'monkey,' 'boy,' and 'black b*tch,'" according to the [EEOC](https://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/eeoc-sues-tesla-racial-harassment-and-retaliation).

The fallout of the agency's closure reaches far beyond Tesla. In California alone, dozens of companies, including Google, Meta, BlackRock and PG&E, were slated for OFCCP investigations. Nationwide, more than 2,000 federal contractors were expected to be reviewed in 2024. Now, those cases have been wiped from the books.

The OFCCP played an important role in holding Silicon Valley accountable for workplace discrimination. The agency secured [multimillion-dollar settlements](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25514971-2021-google-ofccp-conciliation-agreement/) from major tech firms over pay disparities in recent years, including LinkedIn, Google and Cisco. Under its agreements, companies faced continued federal oversight to ensure compliance with anti-discrimination laws.

Trump's order repealed the 1965 executive order that created the OFCCP, deeming it an "illegal" diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiative. Acting Labor Secretary Vincent N. Micone enforced the decision and sent [an email](https://sfstandard.com/2025/02/06/trump-order-stops-tesla-discrimination-investigation/) directing staff to "cease and desist all investigative and enforcement activity."
