## [Is it time for America’s judges to go on strike? / Salon.com](https://www.salon.com/2025/02/15/is-it-time-for-americas-to-go-on-strike/)

*There is a case to be made that the United States is a "vexatious litigant"*

By David Coale. Published February 15, 2025 9:00AM (EST

- There is a discussion about the potential for America's judges to go on strike due to challenges posed by the new administration's actions.
- The Vice President has suggested that the executive branch might ignore court orders, risking a constitutional crisis.
- The principle of judicial review established by Marbury v. Madison, which ensures no one is above the law, is being tested.
- The judiciary has responded with rhetoric, talk of civil-contempt fines, and speculation about contempt charges, but these measures may be ineffective if the executive branch refuses to comply.
- Courts could consider treating the federal government as a vexatious litigant, refusing to hear cases involving the United States until the [executive branch](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) obeys court orders.
- This drastic step could be more effective than fines and other usual remedies.
- Public opinion and understanding the importance of judicial review will be critical in this crisis to maintain the judiciary's legitimacy.

[Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) only complies with court rulings when it is favorable to him. He sues at the slightest perceived slight. The courts need to start pushing back like the *"jailhouse lawyer"* that files briefs simply to overwhelm the court system.
