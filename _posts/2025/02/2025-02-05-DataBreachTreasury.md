## [Opinion / Elon Musk has your Social Security number. It’s as scary as it sounds. - The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/02/05/elon-musk-doge-treasury-payment-system/)

*There is no legitimate reason for the ‘DOGE’ to have access to the federal payment system.*

Opinion
Natasha Sarin. February 5, 2025

- The article criticizes [Elon Musk's](https://x.com/elonmusk/) access to the [Treasury’s](https://www.tresuary.gov/) payment system, arguing there's no legitimate reason for it.
- David A. Lebryk, former acting Treasury Secretary, retired unexpectedly after a conflict with the [Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)](https://doge.com/) team, which Musk leads.
- The [Bureau of the Fiscal Service](http://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/), which manages federal payments, has access to sensitive information like [Social Security](https://www.ssa.gov/) numbers and bank account details.
- The [DOGE](https://doge.com/) team was granted access to the payment system to identify fraudulent and wasteful spending, although they lack experience in handling such sensitive data.
- The [Bureau of the Fiscal Service's](http://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/) role is to process payments, not to decide eligibility for tax credits or [Social Security](https://www.ssa.gov/) benefits; this is done by other agencies like the [IRS](https://www.irs.gov/).
- Concerns are raised about the potential threats to data privacy, cybersecurity, and the stability of the federal government due to [DOGE's](https://doge.com/) access.
- There is skepticism about the ability of Musk and his team to improve government operations as intended.

David A. Lebryk recently retired from his position as the Fiscal Assistant Secretary at the [U.S. Department of the Treasury](https://www.tresuary.gov/) [43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5119996-david-lebryk-retirement-treasury-doge-musk/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1"). He had a long career spanning over three decades, during which he held various roles, including Acting Secretary of the [Treasury](,https://www.tresuary.gov/) for a brief period in January 2025[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lebryk?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2"). Lebryk's departure was prompted by a disagreement over access to the [Bureau of the Fiscal Service's](http://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/) payment systems, which Elon Musk's [Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)](https://doge.com/) sought[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5119996-david-lebryk-retirement-treasury-doge-musk/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1").

The **[Bureau of the Fiscal Service](http://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/)** is responsible for managing the federal government's financial infrastructure[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/david-lebryk?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3"). This includes:

- **Payments**: Issuing payments such as [Social Security](https://www.ssa.gov/) benefits, tax refunds, and salaries for federal employees[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5119996-david-lebryk-retirement-treasury-doge-musk/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1").
- **Collections**: Collecting funds from various sources, including taxes and fees[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/david-lebryk?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3").
- **Debt Financing**: Managing the federal debt and issuing Treasury securities[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/david-lebryk?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3").
- **Cash Management**: Ensuring that the government has sufficient cash on hand to meet its obligations[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/david-lebryk?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3").
- **Reporting and Accounting**: Maintaining accurate financial records and producing reports[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/david-lebryk?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3").
- **Delinquent Debt Collection**: Collecting overdue debts owed to the federal government[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/david-lebryk?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3").
- **Shared Services**: Providing financial services to other federal agencies[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/david-lebryk?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3").

However, the [Bureau of the Fiscal Service](http://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/) **cannot** make decisions about eligibility for tax credits or [Social Security](https://www.ssa.gov/) benefits[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/02/05/elon-musk-doge-treasury-payment-system/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "4"). These decisions are made by other agencies, such as the [Internal Revenue Service (IRS)](https://www.irs.gov/) and the [Social Security Administration[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/02/05/elon-musk-doge-treasury-payment-system/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "4"). The [Bureau's](http://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/) role is primarily mechanical, ensuring that payments are made accurately and on time[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/02/05/elon-musk-doge-treasury-payment-system/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "4").
