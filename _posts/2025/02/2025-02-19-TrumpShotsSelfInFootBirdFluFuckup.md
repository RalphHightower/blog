The beginning of a global pandemic greeted [Trump’s First administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) with Coronavirus, COVID-19. Now, as [Trump’s second administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) clumsily begins, [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) manages to shoot himself in the foot as [avian flu (H5N1), bird flu](https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/index.html)  decimates poultry farmers, forcing them to cull millions of hens to stop the rampant spread.

## [Trump's drive to reshape government threatens bird flu response](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trumps-drive-reshape-government-threaten-bird-flu-response-rcna192133)

*Disruptions to funding and public communication at health agencies come at a potentially perilous time.*

Feb. 15, 2025, 7:00 AM EST
By Shannon Pettypiece

As avian flu drives [egg prices](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/grocery-stores-are-rationing-eggs-supply-falls-prices-rise-rcna192104) to record levels and increasingly poses a [risk to humans](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/first-severe-human-case-bird-flu-rcna184698), moves by the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)) to cut spending and restrict communications have hobbled public health officials’ response, with the new administration yet to outline a clear strategy on how it plans to stem the spread of the virus.

State and local public health officials have gone weeks without regular updates on avian flu from the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/) after [President Donald Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) froze nearly all external communications from the agency, said a person familiar with the situation. It wasn’t until this week that some of those communications began to resume, the person said.

Widespread funding cuts across the government and new restrictions on funding for [National Institutes of Health](https://www.nih.gov/) grants have also created uncertainty among infectious disease researchers and local health officials, who are unsure about what resources they will have to work with going forward. Meanwhile, cuts to the [U.S. Agency for International Development](https://www.usaid.gov/) have limited monitoring of the virus overseas.

“When you add that uncertainty, it plays into what health departments can do when their entire funding situation is at risk,” said [Adriane Casalotti](https://www.naccho.org/about/leadership/adriane-casalotti), chief of government and public affairs for the [National Association of County and City Health Officials](https://www.naccho.org/). “It makes it even harder to do more when you don’t think you’ll have the resources or they might get pulled out from under you.”

At the same time, key positions in the [Trump administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) central to responding to the threat of a pandemic have remained unfilled. And the secretaries running the [Health and Human Services](https://www.hhs.gov/) and [Agriculture](https://www.usda.gov/) departments weren’t confirmed until this week, though bird flu was one of the first items on [Agriculture Secretary](https://www.usda.gov/) Brooke Rollins' agenda after her confirmation.

The disruptions come at a potentially perilous time. The virus has been decimating poultry flocks, causing egg prices to more than [double](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/10/wholesale-egg-prices-have-blown-way-past-prior-record.html). It has been showing signs it can evolve to more easily thrive in a variety of species, including a [new strain](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/usda-detects-second-bird-flu-strain-dairy-cows-rcna190903) detected among dairy cattle this month. While there are no indications the virus can be transmitted among humans, at least 68 people in the U.S. have contracted avian flu and one person has [died](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/first-human-bird-flu-death-us-louisiana-rcna186466a no!zdz), according to the [CDC](https://www cdc.gov/). Researchers worry that the more the virus replicates, the more opportunities it will have to develop a mutation that would enable it to spread easily from human to human.

“This is getting more and more dangerous and urgent, and the scientific community is setting off alarm flares,” said [Stephen Morrison](https://www.csis.org/people/j-stephen-morrison), who directs the global health policy center at the [Center for Strategic and International Studies](https://www.csis.org/). “But are they translating into the government moving at a faster pace or with a different resolve? No. Instead, we’re in a period of confused transition that’s been made worse by the disruptions in government function and the normal slowness of getting the new team in.”

The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)) didn’t respond to a request for comment on its strategy for addressing avian flu and what additional steps it planned to take to address the spread of the virus.

Rollins, who was confirmed by the [Senate](https://www senate.gov/) Thursday, told reporters that she had a briefing in the [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)) Thursday night and would be announcing more on the department’s plan to address egg prices “in the coming days.”

“We are looking at every possible scenario to ensure that we are doing everything we can in a safe, secure manner, but also to ensure that Americans have the food that they need,” Rollins said when asked about the price of eggs. “And as a mom of four teenagers, actually, I fully understand and feel the pain of the cost of these eggs.”

[White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said in an interview on MSNBC Thursday that the [Trump administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) would soon have a strategy now that Rollins has been confirmed.

“It turns out, President Biden’s team didn’t have an avian flu strategy, and now we’re about to have one, as soon as Brooke Rollins is at the [Department of Agriculture](https://www.usda.gov/),” said Hassett.

In a statement on egg prices earlier this week, the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)) said Rollins would take “bold, decisive action to address the crisis” by refocusing the agency tasked with stopping the spread of the virus among animals “on its core mission: protecting the health of the United States’ plants, animals, and natural resources while simultaneously lowering costs.”

So far, though, public health officials say the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)) has created more confusion than clarity.

In [West Virginia](), [Michael Kilkenny](), head of the [Huntington Health Department](), said he hasn’t been getting regular updates from the [CDC](https://www cdc.gov/) for the past several weeks.

“We just don’t know what’s happening right now. We don’t know if this is expanding into our area if we aren’t getting that communication from the [CDC](https://www cdc.gov/),” said [Kilkenny](). “In more rural areas, there are small health departments that, without the information they need coming from the [CDC](https://www cdc.gov/), they’re not going to be able to inform their small-flock farmers, poultry farmers or higher-risk agricultural workers that depend on the local health department for information or services.”

The prospect of potential federal funding cuts have also caused his and other health departments he works with to begin contingency planning and put hiring and new projects on hold.

“We are holding on hiring and we are holding on planning while we are waiting to see that there is clear evidence that things are going to be funded before we can spend our work time planning or even submitting for a project,” said [Kilkenny](). “That is how this disrupts us.”

Along with limiting [CDC](https://www cdc.gov/) communications with local health officials, the [World Health Organization]() has also been receiving limited information on the spread of avian flu in the U.S. since [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) signed an [executive order]() to withdraw from the global health organization, [WHO]() director-general [Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus]() said during a Feb. 12 press conference.

The “near-total communication freeze” at public health agencies “is deeply unprecedented, and that alone scares me more than anything else,” said [Jennifer Nuzzo](), director of the pandemic center at the [Brown University]() [School of Public Health]().

Nearly a month in, [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has yet to name an official to head the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)) [Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy](), which was created in 2022 by Congress to coordinate pandemic response across agencies. During the campaign, [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) said he would likely get rid of the office and criticized [President Joe Biden’s]() efforts to prepare for another pandemic.

“He wants to spend a lot of money on something that you don’t know if it’s gonna be 100 years or 50 years or 25 years,” [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) said of [Biden]() in a July interview with [Time magazine](https://time.com/6972022/donald-trump-transcript-2024-election/). “And it’s just a way of giving out pork.”

“It doesn’t mean that we’re not watching out for it all the time,” [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) said. “But it’s very hard to predict what’s coming because there are a lot of variations of these pandemics.”

[Trump’s]() key Cabinet officials who will be overseeing the federal response have given little insight into their strategy.

Rollins said during her [Senate](https://www senate.gov/) confirmation hearing last month that one of her top four priorities would be to put a team in place to stem the spread of avian flu, though she didn’t say what changes she would like to see the Agriculture Department make.

“There is a lot that I have to learn on this, and if confirmed, this will be, as I mentioned in my opening statement, one of the very top priorities,” Rollins said when asked about her response to avian flu. “We are hyperfocused on finding the team right now. I’m sure they’re already working. I have, obviously, respected the process and not gotten too involved. I know that the current team and the future team will be working hand in hand to do everything we can on animal disease.”

[Health and Human Services]() [Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.](), who was confirmed by the [Senate](https://www senate.gov/) on Thursday, said during his confirmation hearing that he would focus more on tackling chronic disease, like heart disease and diabetes, and less on infectious diseases. When asked about devoting resources to avian flu during his confirmation hearing, >Kennedy]() said he “intends to devote the appropriate resources to preventing pandemics. That’s essential for my job.”

Previously, [Kennedy]() has said the currently available vaccines for avian flu that the U.S. has stockpiled may be dangerous and ineffective. Researchers are working on developing a new generation of avian flu vaccines based on the same mRNA technology used to develop the Covid vaccines, which Kennedy [called](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-health-stances-vaccines-fluoride-raw-milk-rcna180244) the “the deadliest vaccine ever made,” though [studies have shown it to be safe](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-finds-covid-vaccines-not-linked-sudden-death-young-people-rcna147188).

[Kennedy]() has also been a proponent of drinking raw milk, which can put people at risk of foodborne illness, including avian flu. The [CDC](https://www cdc.gov/) has warned that it might be possible to contract bird flu from drinking raw milk and urged Americans to drink only pasteurized milk.

Agriculture industry officials and infectious disease researchers have been calling on the federal government to significantly ramp up its response with greatly expanded testing, funding for research to better understand the virus and develop new treatments, and more assistance for dairy farmers to encourage them to test their cattle.

The [United Egg Producers](), an advocacy group for the egg industry, is urging the federal government and [Congress]() to devote more resources to researching how the virus is spreading and evolving and to develop more effective and widespread vaccinations for animals. The industry group has also been calling for more rules and enforcement around the testing and movement of animals, and additional funding for local laboratories to provide quick and accurate test results.

“Our industry needs more from our state and federal government animal health partners — and we need it fast,” the [United Egg Producers]() said in a statement.

The [organization]() says its industry has lost more than 100 million egg-laying hens since 2022, including more than 29 million over the past four months. Once a flock of birds is infected with the highly pathogenic strain of the avian flu, the virus quickly spreads and is fatal in the vast majority of birds. When a flock becomes infected, farmers and veterinarians are supposed to notify the [USDA](), which will kill the entire flock and decontaminate the facilities. The federal government reimburses the farmers for the live birds that are culled in the process. 

Public health researchers have said the Biden administration didn’t react quickly enough to stop the spread of the virus among dairy cattle after it was first detected in herds in March. It wasn’t until December that the [Agriculture Department]() rolled out a national milk testing program, and [three of the country’s](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/push-detect-virus-milk-supply-testing-bird-flu-cows-rcna188612) top milk-producing states still aren’t a part of that federal surveillance effort.

The Trump administration will have to work with officials in states that still aren’t regularly testing their milk to try to get them on board, said Morrison. [Texas’ state agriculture commissioner, Sid Miller](), told [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/push-detect-virus-milk-supply-testing-bird-flu-cows-rcna188612) that surveillance milk testing was unnecessary in [Texas]() since there weren’t any active cases of bird flu in the state’s commercial cattle or poultry.

“From April until the end of the Biden administration, the response was slow and sluggish,” said Morrison. “We are still not testing animals and humans at the level that is needed, we still don’t have a coherent strategy and a system of accountability, and we still don’t have in place the kind of compensation mechanisms needed for those dairy farmers who suffer losses because of infections in their herds.”

Researchers worry the U.S. is running out of time to strengthen its response.

“If we don’t act now, we’re only giving the virus more opportunity to continue to adapt and potentially evolve into something more dangerous in a human population,” said [Erin Sorrell](), a senior scholar at the [Johns Hopkins]() [Center for Health Security](). “Now is the time to act.”

[Trader Joe’s]() is dealing with the shortages by limiting the amount of eggs customers can buy.

“Due to ongoing issues with the supply of eggs, we are currently limiting egg purchases to one dozen per customer, per day, in all [Trader Joe’s]() stores across the country,” a spokesperson said in a statement. “We hope these limits will help to ensure that as many of our customers who need eggs are able to purchase them when they visit [Trader Joe’s]().”

[Walmart]() is limiting bulk buyers to two 60-count cartons per purchase “to help ensure more customers can have access to eggs,” a spokesperson said.

“Although supply is very tight, we’re working with suppliers to try and help meet customer demand, while striving to keep prices as low as possible.”

At [Sam’s Club](), purchasers are allowed to buy two cartons of each brand of eggs on the shelves, a spokesperson said.

But at [Kroger]() and Aldi there is a two dozen eggs per trip limit, while [Whole Foods]() and [Costco]() are capping egg purchases at three one-dozen cartons per person in select stores.

[Congressional Dads Caucus](https://gomez.house.gov/dadscaucus/) said in a letter Thursday to [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/):
- “Over the last several weeks, you have done nothing to address these rising costs. Moreover, your flurry of executive actions has hampered the government’s response to effectively address the underlying causes of this crisis. Eggs are a basic necessity for families in our districts, and the financial burden caused by these surging prices must be resolved.”
In [New York City](), some bodegas have taken to selling eggs one at a time because their customers can't afford to shell out $10 or more to buy a dozen eggs, a price that is not unusual in the very expensive city.

“These people don’t have enough money to buy a dozen eggs, so I have to sell them separately,” Fernando Rodriguez, 62, owner of [Pamela’s Green Deli](https://www.pamelasproducts.com/) in The Bronx, told the [New York Post](https://nypost.com/2025/02/12/us-news/nyc-bodegas-selling-loosie-eggs-as-prices-of-cartons-skyrocket/).

[President Donald J. Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)
The White House
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
Washington, D.C. 20500

Dear [President Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/),

As members of the [Congressional Dads Caucus](https://gomez.house.gov/dadscaucus/), we write to demand immediate action from your [administration]( to address the skyrocketing price of eggs. Over the last several weeks, you have done nothing to address these rising costs. Moreover, your flurry of executive actions has hampered [the government's response]() to effectively address the underlying causes of this crisis. Eggs are a basic necessity for families in our districts, and the financial burden caused by these surging prices must be resolved.

Under the [Trump administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), families are spending more than 11% of their disposable income on food—the highest level in more than three decades. This week, the average price of a dozen eggs nationwide has reached $5.00, with some retailers even limiting purchases. The [U.S. Department of Agriculture](https://www.usda.gov/) predicts prices could rise another 20% this year, further straining small businesses and consumers alike. The [National Restaurant Association]() reports that producer costs for eggs have increased by 134% year over year. Traditionally, eggs are an inexpensive, high-quality protein that can help feed families when the price of beef or chicken is too costly. But now, this modest staple has families and small businesses struggling to keep up. Further inaction will only cause families to fall further behind, straining other parts of their budget, such as child care, rent, or mortgage.

A factor contributing to this price increase is the [outbreak of avian flu among chickens](). Since February 2022, 140 million birds have been affected nationwide, and nearly 13 million birds have been infected or culled in just the past month alone. This outbreak is causing a massive shortage of egg-producing chickens. This [novel strain of avian flu]() could threaten other parts of our food system if not properly managed. For example, nearly 1,000 cattle herds across 16 states have recently been affected, which could lead to future dairy impacts if inadequately controlled. Simply put, this flu will continue to disrupt the food supply chain until the outbreak is under control.

Because the price of eggs is inextricably linked to the avian flu, we are deeply concerned by your previous statements calling to disband the [Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR)](). Furthermore, your decision to pause communications coming from [federal health agencies has exacerbated the situation](). We are aware that your administration has already shut down the [OPPR website](), further limiting transparency and access to crucial information, making it harder for farmers and public health officials to respond effectively. Furthermore, the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's]() inability to produce its weekly report delayed two publications related to the bird flu since your order. Your actions are directly contributing to this affordability crisis facing American families.

Given the urgent need to bring down egg prices, we ask for a speedy reply to the following questions on what actions your administration is taking to address this problem

1.	_**Roll Back Harmful Executive Actions and Take Immediate Steps to Control the Spread of Avian Flu**_: What specific steps is your [administration]() taking to stop the spread of the [avian flu](), support [poultry farmers](), and stabilize the egg supply? How will you take decisive action to protect the health of our agricultural industry and ensure food security?

1.	_**Provide Clarity on the Future of the [Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR)]()**_: How will [your administration]() ensure that the [OPPR’s]() vital functions continue? Shutting down resources critical to controlling pandemics during a food crisis is a failure of leadership, and we deserve clear answers about whether these efforts will be maintained or abandoned.

[Mr. President](), you've promised the American people that you would lower grocery prices. It's time to deliver. Families across the country cannot afford more delays or inaction. This is about the health, nutrition, and financial stability of millions of Americans who are already struggling.

We expect a prompt response outlining your administration's actions to lower egg prices, protect farmers, and prevent further strain on families. The American people need leadership and solutions—now.

Sincerely,

### [Rep. Jimmy Gomez Leads 32 Dads Caucus in Calling on President Trump to Take Immediate Action to End the Egg Price Crisis / U.S. Representative Jimmy Gomez](https://gomez.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=3238)

Washington, February 14, 2025

WASHINGTON, D.C. – [Congressman Jimmy Gomez (CA-34)]() is leading 32 members of the [Congressional Dads Caucus](https://gomez.house.gov/dadscaucus/) in calling for immediate action from [President Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) to tackle the skyrocketing price eggs, which is placing a significant financial strain on working families and small businesses alike. With retailers rationing eggs, restaurants adding surcharges to consumers, and even reports of egg theft, the crisis is worsening—yet [President Trump and his administration]() remain silent and missing in action.

Established through bipartisan legislation, the [Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR)]() coordinates federal efforts to manage pandemics and crises. On the campaign trail, [President Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) vowed to disband the [OPPR](). Within days of returning to office, he downsized the [OPPR](), shut down its website, and paused communications from [federal health agencies]()—raising concerns about the nation's ability to respond to health emergencies like the [current avian flu outbreak]() driving up egg prices. In a [letter](), [Rep. Gomez]() and his colleagues demand answers on what steps the Trump administration is taking to control the spread of avian flu, provide clarity about the [OPPR’s]() future, and bring down egg prices.

“As members of the [Congressional Dads Caucus](https://gomez.house.gov/dadscaucus/), we write to demand immediate action from your administration to address the skyrocketing price of eggs. Over the last several weeks, you have done nothing to address these rising costs. Moreover, your flurry of executive actions has hampered the government's response to effectively address the underlying causes of this crisis. Eggs are a basic necessity for families in our districts, and the financial burden caused by these surging prices must be resolved,” wrote the lawmakers.

“[Mr. President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), you've promised the American people that you would lower grocery prices. It's time to deliver. Families across the country cannot afford more delays or inaction. This is about the health, nutrition, and financial stability of millions of Americans who are already struggling. We expect a prompt response outlining your administration's actions to lower egg prices, protect farmers, and prevent further strain on families,” concluded the lawmakers.

In addition to [Gomez](), the letter was also signed by Representatives [Suhas Subramanyam (VA-10)](), [Sylvester Turner (TX-18)](), [Raul Ruiz](), [M.D. (CA-25)](), [Gil Cisneros (CA-31)](), [Seth Magaziner (RI-02)](), [Chris Deluzio (PA-17)](), [Eric Swalwell (CA-14)](), [Eugene Simon Vindman (VA-07)](), [Mike Levin (CA-49)](), [Brad Sherman (CA-32)](), [Rashida Tlaib (MI-12)](), [Jimmy Panetta (CA-19)](), [Brittany Pettersen (CO-07)](), [Seth Moulton (MA-06)](), [Jason Crow (CO-06)](), [Johnny Olszewski](), [Jr. (MD-02)](), [Dan Goldman (NY-10)](), [Robert J.
