## [Attorney General James Leads Multistate Coalition in Suing to Stop Elon Musk and DOGE’s Attacks on Americans](https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2025/attorney-general-james-leads-multistate-coalition-suing-stop-elon-musk-and-doges)

February 7, 2025
NEW YORK – [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) [Attorney General](https://ag.ny.gov/) [Letitia James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james) today led a coalition of [18 other attorneys general](https://dems.ag/) in [filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration to stop the unauthorized disclosure of Americans’ private information and sensitive data](https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/court-filings/state-of-new-york-et-al-v-trump-doge-temporary-restraining-order-memo-2025.pdf). [Attorney General](https://ag.ny.gov/) [James’](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james) lawsuit asserts that the [Trump administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) illegally provided [Elon Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/) and the so-called “[Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)](https://doge.gov/)” unauthorized access to the [Treasury Department’s](https://home.treasury.gov/) [central payment system](https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/), and therefore to Americans’ most sensitive personal information, including bank account details and [Social Security numbers](https://www.ssa.gov/). This expanded access could allow [Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/) and his team to block federal funds to states and programs providing health care, childcare, and other critical services. With this lawsuit, [Attorney General](https://ag.ny.gov/) [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james) and the [coalition of attorneys general](https://dems.ag/) are seeking to stop the [Trump administration’s](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) new policy that illegally grants [DOGE](https://doge.gov/), [Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/), and others access to Americans’ confidential information and the [U.S. Treasury’s](https://home.treasury.gov/) [payment systems](https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/).

“As the richest man in the world, [Elon Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/) is not used to being told ‘no,’ but in our country, no one is above the law,” said [Attorney General](https://ag.ny.gov/) [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james). “[President Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) does not have the power to give away Americans’ private information to anyone he chooses, and he cannot cut federal payments approved by [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/). [Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/) and [DOGE](https://doge.gov/) have no authority to access Americans’ private information and some of our country’s most sensitive data. I am taking action to keep our information secure, and to prevent any unconstitutional freeze on essential funding that Americans rely on every day.”

Beginning February 2, 2025, the [Trump administration’s](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Treasury Department](https://home.treasury.gov/) adopted a new policy that grants “special government employees,” including [Elon Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/) and members of [DOGE](https://doge.gov/), access to its [central payment system](https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/) operated by the [Bureau of Fiscal Services (BFS)](http://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/). This [central payment system](https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/) controls vital funding that millions of Americans depend on, including [Social Security payments](https://www.ssa.gov/), [veteran’s benefits](https://www va gov/), [Medicare](https://www.medicare.gov/) and [Medicaid](https://www.medicaid.gov/) payments, and more. The payment system also controls billions of dollars that states rely on to support essential services like law enforcement, public education, and infrastructure repairs.

Access to [BFS](http://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/) is limited by federal law to a select group of career civil servants with the appropriate security clearances. [Attorney General](https://ag.ny.gov/) James and the coalition assert the [Treasury Department’s](https://home.treasury.gov/) new policy, which expands access to [BFS’s payment system](https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/), violates the law, jeopardizes Americans’ most sensitive personal information, and would allow [Elon Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/) and other unauthorized political appointees to access a system that could permit them to freeze federal funds with the click of a button in violation of the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov).

With this lawsuit, [Attorney General](https://ag.ny.gov/) [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james) and the [coalition of [attorneys general](https://doge.gov/) are seeking an injunction preventing the [Trump administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) from continuing its new policy of expanded access to [BFS’s payment system](https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/), as well as a declaration that the [Treasury Department’s](https://home.treasury.gov) policy change is unlawful and unconstitutional.

Joining [Attorney General](https://ag.ny.gov/) James in filing the lawsuit are the [attorneys general](https://doge.gov/) of [Arizona](https://www.azag.gov/), [California](), [Colorado](), [Connecticut](), [Delaware](), [Hawaii](), [Illinois](), [Maine](), [Maryland](), [Massachusetts](), [Minnesota](), [Nevada](), [New Jersey](), [North Carolina](), [Oregon](), [Rhode Island](), [Vermont](), and [Wisconsin]().

This matter is being handled by Special Counsel Andrew Amer, Special Counsel for Complex Litigation Colleen Faherty, and Special Counsel for Federal Initiatives Rabia Muqaddam, under the supervision of First Deputy Attorney General Jennifer Levy.


## [Attorney General James and 11 Attorneys General Release Joint Statement on Lawsuit to Protect Americans from Elon Musk’s DOGE](https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2025/attorney-general-james-and-11-attorneys-general-release-joint-statement-lawsuit)

February 14, 2025
NEW YORK – [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) [Attorney General](https://ag.ny.gov/) [Letitia James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james) today led a [coalition of 11 other attorneys general](https://dems.ag/) in releasing the following statement ahead of a court hearing in their case against the [Trump administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) for illegally granting [Elon Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/) and members of the [Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)](https://doge.gov/) access to Americans’ private information:

“Last week, [Elon Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/) and his team got into our nation’s [central payment system](https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/) in the [Treasury Department](https://home.treasury.gov/), giving them unauthorized access to the [Social Security numbers](https://www.ssa.gov/), bank account information, and other private data of tens of millions of Americans.

“To protect our states’ residents, we filed a lawsuit to stop the madness. Just a few hours later, we won a court order blocking [Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/) and [DOGE](https://doge.gov/) from accessing Americans’ personal information and ordering the destruction of all the copies of records they had obtained.

“[Elon Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/) may be the richest man in the world, but the law is clear: he has no authority to access your private information. The [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/) gives [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) – not the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) – primary control over federal spending."

On February 7, [Attorney General](https://ag.ny.gov/) [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james) [led a coalition of 18 other attorneys general in filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/links-1.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:*2F*2Fag.ny.gov*2Fpress-release*2F2025*2Fattorney-general-james-leads-multistate-coalition-suing-stop-elon-musk-and-doges/1/0100019505af0aec-9612a18b-4c6a-4d84-ae22-f52e57c39124-000000/qiWMlCM6dYTi558-AVjyUPZuYsOuu3g0VrmLhOC3G8g=392__;JSUlJSU!!Ke5ujdWW74OM!-uK6F1-2mIefZ4niyf83H3HtkBUFcAY6UoVyPE3AD9lImki6EV-mWfWr-97u_7ZwxOCi_ZzylBlWnUE_wFo_lr17xcFJGZR9oMjclabAtR_8$) to stop the unauthorized disclosure of Americans’ private information. [Attorney General](https://ag.ny.gov/) [James’](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james) lawsuit asserts that the [Trump administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) illegally provided [Elon Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/) and [DOGE](https://doge.gov/) unauthorized access to the [Treasury Department’s](https://home.treasury.gov/) [central payment system](https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/), and therefore to Americans’ most sensitive personal information. On the morning of February 8, a federal judge in the [Southern District of New York](https://www.uscourts.gov/federal-court-finder/location/1708) [granted Attorney General James’ motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO)](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/links-1.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:*2F*2Fag.ny.gov*2Fpress-release*2F2025*2Fattorney-general-james-releases-statement-swift-victory-lawsuit-stopping-doges-0/1/0100019505af0aec-9612a18b-4c6a-4d84-ae22-f52e57c39124-000000/G9N9CmwMH4iKpIlNwAjfL3tmsCAt4lkMkNFrSVkqvJc=392__;JSUlJSU!!Ke5ujdWW74OM!-uK6F1-2mIefZ4niyf83H3HtkBUFcAY6UoVyPE3AD9lImki6EV-mWfWr-97u_7ZwxOCi_ZzylBlWnUE_wFo_lr17xcFJGZR9oMjclQeSVpMH$)
 blocking [Elon Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/) and his [DOGE](https://doge.gov/) employees from accessing Americans’ most sensitive personal information and ordering them to immediately destroy any and all copies of records they had already obtained.

[Attorney General](https://ag.ny.gov/) [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james) and the coalition are today seeking a preliminary injunction to continue to bar the unauthorized access to Americans’ personal data through the Treasury’s payment system.

Joining [Attorney General](https://ag.ny.gov/) [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james) in releasing this statement are the [attorneys general](https://dems.ag) of [Arizona](https://www.azag.gov/,), [California](), [Colorado](), [Connecticut](), [Delaware](), [Illinois](), [Maine](), [Maryland](), [Massachusetts](), [New Jersey](), and [Oregon]().s
