In an effort to not only rewrite the history of his January 6 insurrection but to exact revenge on the agents and lawyers who worked to hold him and his rioting supporters accountable, [Donald Trump](https:www.whitehouse.gov/) appears to be in the midst of a massive purge of the [FBI](https://.www.fbi.gov/) and the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/), turning them into agencies that cater to his interests and concerns instead of the law. Rachel Maddow explains.
