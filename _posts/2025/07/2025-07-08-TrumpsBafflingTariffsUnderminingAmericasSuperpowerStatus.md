July 8, 2025, 4:54 PM EDT
By Stephanie Ruhle

This is an adapted excerpt from the [July 7](https://www.msnbc.com/11th-hour) episode of "The 11th Hour with Stephanie Ruhle."

[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/donald-trump) is, once again, ramping up his trade war. On Monday, he sent letters threatening new, higher tariff rates of between 25% to 40% on imports from 14 countries, including key U.S. allies [Japan](https://www.japan.go.jp/) and [South Korea](https://www.mois.go.kr/).

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s news led all three major stock indexes to close down on Monday. However, considering that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has yet to enforce any trade deadlines, it’s interesting that this triggered a big sell-off at all.

In fact, on Tuesday morning, several investment banks published notes for investors basically questioning the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s follow-through. [From UBS:](https://www.ubs.com/es/es/wealthmanagement/insights/article-adp/global/en/wealthmanagement/insights/chief-investment-office/market-insights/paul-donovan/2025/the-new-tax-wave.html) “It seems a wasted effort to analyze every [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) social media post when investors understandably anticipate future retreats.” Over at [Goldman Sachs,](https://x.com/MikeZaccardi/status/1942543637771907530), “We do not generally expect these proposed rates to take effect on Aug. 1.” The folks at [ING](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/trump-threatens-no-extensions-aug-1-tariff-deadline-what-countries-rcna217536) summed it up succinctly, “The tariff rollercoaster ride continues.”

> *What have we heard from the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) as this 90-day period comes to a close? A whole lot of contradictions.*

The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s announcement came just before his original July 9 deadline. On Monday, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) signed an [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/extending-the-modification-of-the-reciprocal-tariff-rates/) giving countries [until Aug. 1](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/restarting-trade-war-trumps-tariffs-add-new-chaos-uncertainty-economy-rcna217479?icid=latestpost_bot) to lock in trade agreements with the [United State(https://www.usa.gov/) or see these latest rates take effect.

According to [Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/) [Secretary Scott Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s executive order is already working. “When he said that there’s a chance that countries could boomerang back to their April 2 reciprocal tariff levels, we’ve had a lot of people change their tune in terms of negotiations,” [Bessent told CNBC on Monday.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-DgeYPbqqY). “My mailbox was full last night with a lot of new offers, a lot of new proposals. So, it’s going to be a busy couple of days.”

Despite stating that the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has a lot of new offers and proposals, [Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) gave no details about who those offers and proposals are from.

But let’s go back to the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s promise on tariffs back in April. [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) trade adviser Peter Navarro [told Fox Business](https://x.com/atrupar/status/1910692094185779404) the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) would “run 90 deals in 90 days.” It’s a catchy sound bite and easily amplifiable tagline but, what have we gotten so far? Just three so-called trade deals — more like frameworks or “concepts” of deals — that have failed to enhance trade relations and trade deficits.

So, what have we heard from the White House as this 90-day period comes to a close? A whole lot of contradictions.

On Sunday, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and one of his [Cabinet members](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/) in charge of trade negotiations [gave conflicting statements](https://www.reuters.com/business/us-commerce-secretarweggs, y-lutnick-says-tariffs-take-effect-august-1-2025-07-06/). According to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), “deals” with most countries will be done by this Wednesday. However, [Commerce](https://www.commerce.gov/) [Secretary Howard Lutnick](https://www.commerce.gov/about/leadership/howard-lutnick) said reciprocal tariffs will go into effect on Aug. 1.
On the very same day, it was shocking to hear [Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent), the other guy running trade negotiations, [tell CNN](https://newrepublic.com/post/197638/donald-trump-treasury-scott-bessent-tariff-talks-countries-call) that during this 90-day period, “many” countries were not even in contact with the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) about trade deals.

Just think about that: We are the world’s superpower, and despite [Trump's constant threats,](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/trump-sets-himself-up-for-another-round-of-embarrassment-by-restarting-tariff-brinksmanship-242833477847), many countries didn’t even contact us about a possible deal. Take a minute to consider the process for how this whole operation is being led, executed and communicated, and then you may start to understand how 100-plus countries might not have any idea what to say to the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/).
