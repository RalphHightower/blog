## [‘Completely absent’: Why is Trump’s acting FEMA chief nowhere to be found?](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/completely-trumps-acting-fema-chief-nowhere-found-rcna218279)

*In the wake of deadly flooding in [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/), we don’t know where the current [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/) chief is, or whether he’s doing the job. That’s not ideal.*

July 11, 2025, 11:34 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) had a credible official leading the [Federal Emergency Management Agency](https://www.fema.gov/). His name was Cameron Hamilton, and he had experience as a [Navy](https://www.navy.mil/) [SEAL](https://www.nsw.navy.mil/), a former combat medic and as the former director of the Emergency Medical Services Division at the [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/).

He was nevertheless [fired last month](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/fema-chief-fired-cameron-hamilton-trump-rcna205676), not because he did something wrong but because Hamilton — a lifelong conservative Republican — testified before [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) and told lawmakers that it would be in the public’s interest if [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/) continued to exist. [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), of course, [wants to eliminate FEMA altogether](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)/113985962341531654), and so Hamilton, [one day after his testimony](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/09/trump-presidency-news/#link-THSXFS5I6FGMDJSZ54KHQJAHOY), found himself [out of a job](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/fema-chief-fired-cameron-hamilton-trump-rcna205676).

He was soon replaced by David Richardson, who has no background in emergency management, and who, on his first day as the agency’s acting chief, told [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/)’s staff that he would “[run right over](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/05/09/fema-head-run-right-over-staff/83533958007/?tbref=hp)” anyone who gets in his way.

If, in the wake of deadly flooding in [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/), you’re thinking that Richardson has kept a surprisingly low profile, it’s not your imagination. [Politico’s E&E News reported](https://www.eenews.net/articles/fema-leader-is-a-no-show-after-deadly-texas-flooding/):

> *As the [Federal Emergency Management Agency](https://www.fema.gov/) responds to the deadly flooding in [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/), one key resource is missing: the [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/) leader. David Richardson, the agency’s acting administrator, has not been to the site of one of the nation’s deadliest floods in the U.S. in the past 25 years, upending a long practice of [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/) leaders making themselves visible after major disasters.*

At first blush, the fact that the current [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/) chief hasn’t even been on site in [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) seems bizarre, but making matters worse is that Richardson hasn’t maintained any kind of public profile at all of late — no public appearances, no official statements, not even messages released by way of social media.

A current [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/) employee told [Politico](https://www.politico.com/)’s E&E News, “When Hamilton was in the role, he was out there doing something to encourage us or announce something or do a photo op with survivors or regional [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/) leadership. I have no idea what’s going on with David Richardson’s absence.”

This has not gone unnoticed on Capitol Hill.

[Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Andy Kim (D-NJ)](https://www.kim.senate.gov/) spoke with [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/)’s Chris Hayes, and asked about Richardson, [the New Jersey Democrat said](https://x.com/Acyn/status/1943471925625524482), “Where is he right now? Has anyone actually seen him since this disaster in [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/)? I mean, we have a completely absent [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/) acting administrator.”

We don’t know where the current [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/) chief is or whether he’s even doing the job. When assessing the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s handling of the heartbreaking flooding in [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/), this seems like a rather important detail.
