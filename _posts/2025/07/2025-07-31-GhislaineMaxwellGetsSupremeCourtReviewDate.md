## [Supreme Court sets date to consider whether to review Ghislaine Maxwell’s appeal](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-ghislaine-maxwell-review-private-conference-rcna221981)

*Alongside other pending petitions, Maxwell’s will be considered in the high court’s private conference Sept. 29. It takes four justices to grant review.*

July 30, 2025, 1:41 PM EDT
By [Jordan Rubin](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jordan-rubin-ncpn1301611)

The [Supreme Court](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/consumer-product-safety-commission-decision-supreme-court-trump-rcna220673) has officially set a date — Sept. 29 — to consider at a private conference whether it will review [Ghislaine Maxwell’s challenge](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/ghislaine-maxwell-supreme-court-appeal-brief-epstein-trump-rcna221567) to her sex trafficking convictions.

This typical scheduling development might not normally be relevant to national political news. But Maxwell is at the center of [a controversy](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-jolts-epstein-scandal-new-comments-virginia-giuffre-mar-lago-spa-rcna221827) stemming from the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s refusal to release all information related to Jeffrey Epstein, the late disgraced financier. Maxwell was convicted of conspiring with Epstein to sexually abuse minors.

Indeed, her lawyers referenced her pending petition [in a letter Tuesday](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/ghislaine-maxwell-pardon-congress-testimony-rcna221803) Tuesday to the [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Oversight Committee](https://oversight.house.gov/). Responding to the committee’s bid to depose her, the lawyers said they wanted to put off any congressional testimony until after [her petition](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-1073/355252/20250424150144637_24-__PetitionForWritOfCertiorari.pdf) is resolved (or if President [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [grants her clemency](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/ghislaine-maxwell-trump-pardon-sentencing-doj-rcna221449) first).

To be clear, this [scheduling development](https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/24-1073.html) is normal. It might be the only normal thing to happen in the [Epstein saga](https://www.npr.org/2025/07/29/nx-s1-5484129/todd-blanche-epstein-ghislaine-maxwell-trump). All it means is that the justices will consider her petition alongside others as the court returns from summer break ahead of the [new term](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-campaign-finance-first-amendment-rcna215931) that starts in October.

The court has regularly scheduled private conferences [throughout the term](https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/2025TermCourtCalendar.pdf), and it adds new cases to the docket on a rolling basis. It takes [four justices](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/alito-thomas-abortion-parental-consent-supreme-court-rcna216771) to grant review, and the court rejects most petitions.

Keep in mind that a case being put on for conference on a given day doesn’t mean we will hear that day whether the justices are taking a given case. The justices don’t always immediately announce such decisions, and they sometimes consider petitions at multiple conferences before deciding. There’s no deadline for the court’s decision.
