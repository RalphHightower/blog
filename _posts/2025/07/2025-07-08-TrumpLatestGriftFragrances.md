## [Trump’s ’Victory 45-47' fragrance may smell good. But its existence stinks.](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-victory-fragrance-45-47-rcna217349)

*Shilling products while in office has become common for Trump.*

July 7, 2025, 7:23 PM EDT
By Hannah Holland, [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) producer

Last week, while much of the country was focused on [the sweeping legislative bill](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-final-vote-trump-big-beautiful-bill-republicans-rcna216626) that will affect every single American in one way or another, [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) debuted a fragrance that he calls [Victory 45-47](https://gettrumpfragrances.com/products/victory-47-the-trump-perfume-for-women). [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) made the announcement on [Truth Social](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)/posts/114774905224497775), where he urged Americans to go buy it: “Get yourself a bottle, and don’t forget to get one for your loved ones too. Enjoy, have fun, and keep winning!”

> *Get yourself a bottle, and don’t forget to get one for your loved ones too. Enjoy, have fun, and keep winning!* <br /><br />[Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/,)'s pitch for victory 45-47 fragrance on truth social

This is far from [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s first foray into the fragrance market; it’s at least his third. In 2012, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), then the star of [NBC](https://www.nbcnews.com/)’s reality show “The Apprentice,” released a cologne called Success. When [asked about Success and fragrances in GQ](https://www.gq.com/story/a-qa-with-donald-trump-scent-enthusiast), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) confirmed that he had, in fact, “never fired anybody for the wrong cologne—but I have fired people that, and maybe it wasn’t the main reason, didn’t exactly smell good.”

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) debuted a second perfume, called Fight, Fight, Fight, last summer after surviving an assassination attempt in [Butler](https://www.butlercountypa.gov/), [Pennsylvania](https://www.pa.gov/en.html). Still for sale today, Fight, Fight, Fight bears a photo of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) with his fist raised in triumph, likely in reference to the [infamous photo](https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/the-trump-shooting) captured from that moment.

Now there’s Victory 45-47 for “men who lead with strength, confidence, and purpose.” The description of the women’s fragrance says that it “captures confidence, beauty, and unstoppable determination” and that it is a “sophisticated, subtly feminine scent that’s your go-to signature for any occasion.”

From [Muhammad Ali](https://gulfbusiness.com/muhammad-ali-fragrances-now-available-dubai/) to [Ariana Grande](https://www.billboard.com/culture/product-recommendations/ariana-grande-lovenotes-fragrance-set-where-to-buy-online-1235939402/), there’s a very long history of celebrities and public figures who have capitalized on the lucrative fragrance industry. [Paris Hilton](https://wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/fragrance/paris-hilton-fragrance-launch-electrify-entrepreneur-1203317204/), who released her 30th fragrance in April, [has reportedly sold more than \$2.5 billion in perfume since 2004](https://wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/fragrance/paris-hilton-iconic-fragrance-ulta-beauty-1237070202/). Of course, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is not a mere celebrity, but the [president of the United States of America.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)

That’s why this whole enterprise stinks. Shilling products as a candidate or [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has become de rigueur for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). Victory 45-47 is the latest in a long list of items he’s hawked including [watches](https://gettrumpwatches.com/?srsltid=AfmBOop2aM8djDH5rWxgEfl6fRqZvOuF2XwZlyzni6H0yw8xUS8QU01H), [guitars](https://gettrumpguitars.com/), [sneakers](https://gettrumpsneakers.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqVMrWxziqLbwV1h7XwX3wIDDDjz1m7LY9U7m2wMMwN4AJVD989) and [Bibles](https://godblesstheusabible.com/?srsltid=AfmBOor2zBeMaDitaMYv3SmwZNFwXCBO4oPinE_QpC2KTh4687Tpsr7r). According to [financial disclosures](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)-Donald-J.-Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).pdf) released in June, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has \$1.6 billion in assets including his branded items.

Fragrance, [the fastest-growing sector](https://www.glossy.co/beauty/the-fragrance-boom-is-nowhere-near-over/) in the massive beauty industry, is projected to hit \$9 billion in [annual sales](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/07/fragrance-sales-prestige-viral/) by 2026. There has been a [proliferation of social media posts](https://www.tiktok.com/tag/perfumetok?lang=en) dedicated to finding a “signature scent” with an emphasis on mixing more than one brand-name perfume. Perfume is no longer regarded as a luxury, but a necessity where price matters little. Rihanna, for example, who has a [reputation for smelling good](https://www.businessinsider.com/what-perfume-does-rihanna-wear-2019-7), [reportedly wears a fragrance that sells for up to \$1,020](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/celebrities-cant-stop-talking-good-142600012.html). She is inspirational, not aspirational, for perfume devotees.

> *So, how does Victory 45-47 smell? Apparently, not bad.*

So, how does Victory 45-47 smell? Apparently, not bad. [Fragrantica, which reviewed the cologne and the perfume](https://www.fragrantica.com/news/TRUMP-VICTORY-45-47-For-Men-Review-GIVEAWAY-22868.html#cc305783), described the perfume as “very safe, fresh, and pleasant fougère […] simple and inoffensive, rather quiet, office-safe, with a sweetish and smooth amber-woody finish.” The cologne was similarly described as “an average, passing casual masculine scent without remarkable details.” This inoffensive type smell is common for celebrity perfumes nowadays: Pedestrian smells sell more units.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) supporters, though, may care less about the scent than they do the limited edition Victory 45-47 bottle, which is clearly intended as a collector’s item. The bottle is composed of a rose gold figurine of a remarkably slim [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) that looks like a cross between a Little League trophy and the massive statue that Turkmenistan’s former [dictator erected of himself in 2015](https://www.businessinsider.com/turkmenistans-dictator-just-built-a-huge-golden-statue-of-himself-riding-a-horse-2015-5). The figurine sits atop a base adorned with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s signature.

The 2012 GQ item about [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s Success fragrance said it would be “sold as a four-piece collection and range from \$14 to \$55.” It seems he went higher-end this time around. At \$250 for 3.3 ounces, Victory 45-47 is far more expensive than the ubiquitous Chanel No. 5, but cheaper than [Brooklyn](https://www.brooklynbp.nyc.gov/)’s most cliché scent Le Labo Santal 33.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has deftly tapped into one of the most damning parts of contemporary American culture: conspicuous consumption. He has proven, again and again, that his fans will buy anything that bears his likeness. He, like so many celebrity perfumers before him, is not creating fragrance out of artistry or passion, but out of a seemingly insatiable desire for wealth.

That kind of avarice in a [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) should worry us. After all, no matter how good, or “safe,” Victory 45-47 might smell, a [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) selling it at all is a sign that we’re losing something as a country.
