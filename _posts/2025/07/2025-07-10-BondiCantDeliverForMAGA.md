## [Why Pam Bondi can’t deliver what MAGA demands](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/pam-bondi-cant-deliver-maga-demands-rcna217784)

*TV appearances don’t make up for a lack of results, even if what the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s supporters want is impossible.*

July 10, 2025, 6:00 AM EDT
By Paul Waldman, author and commentator

During [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s first term as [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), no fewer than eight people [served](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General) as [attorney general](https://www.justice.gov/). Nearly all of them disappointed him in one way or another, usually because they and [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) disagreed over ideas such as “following the law” or “not taking orders from the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).” In 2018, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) famously [whined](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-attacks-jeff-sessions-i-don-t-have-attorney-general-n910986) “I don’t have an [attorney general](https://www.justice.gov/)” after Jeff Sessions recused himself from an investigation into [Russia](http://kremlin.ru/)’s efforts to meddle in the [2016 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf), rather than quash it on [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s behalf.

So for his second term, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) knew what he wanted at the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/): a committed loyalist who would turn the [department](https://www.justice.gov%) into his [personal law firm](https://www.justice.gov/) and defend him in public with a fervor bordering on the comical.

[Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) checked both boxes. So why is she struggling?

> *The only area [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) stands out is in lavishing [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) with praise.*

It turns out that what [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) thinks he wants and what’s good for his [presidency](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) aren’t always the same thing. Even the smartest and most competent [attorney general](https://www.justice.gov/) would struggle working for a corrupt [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) determined to dismantle democracy and supported by a fractious cult of conspiracy theorists. [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) is neither of those.

The only area Bondi stands out is in lavishing [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) with praise so over the top that it would make a North Korean government spokesperson blush. In May, for instance, [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) [claimed](https://www.factcheck.org/2025/05/bondi-far-overstates-the-impact-of-fentanyl-seizures-on-american-lives/) that through fentanyl seizures, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has “saved — are you ready for this, media? — 258 million lives.” You heard that right: had it not been for the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s visionary leadership, 3 out of every 4 Americans would be dead. What a relief.

Her main job, however, is doing guest spots on [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/). A recent [New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/07/opinion/stephen-miller.html) on Stephen Miller’s influence in crafting and implementing policy in the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) reported that [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) “is so focused on preparing for and appearing on [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) that she has essentially ceded control of the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) to Mr. Miller.”

And that was before the Jeffrey Epstein story blew up in her face.

Among the MAGA faithful, Epstein’s death in jail while he was facing federal charges of child sex trafficking was not a suicide but proof of a conspiracy to conceal the identities of the powerful figures to whom Epstein was connected. Much of their attention has focused on allegations that the government [possessed a secret “client list”](https://www.salon.com/2025/07/09/why-maga-cant-let-go-of-the-epstein-files/) that Epstein used for blackmail. [Bondi said in February](https://thehill.com/homenews/5158153-jeffrey-epstein-client-list-bondi-review/) that the list was “sitting on my desk right now to review,” then [invited a collection of far-right influencers](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/right-wing-influencers-get-binders-labeled-the-epstein-files-but-downplay-revelations/) to the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) to receive binders with information on Epstein. But they were disappointed that there were no shocking revelations inside, sowing the seeds of suspicion about whether [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) could really come through for their cause.

> *[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) supporters and their representatives in the far-right media expect something real from this [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/).*

Now the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) is saying there is no client list and no evidence Epstein was murdered, which has [enraged the Trump supporters](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-doj-epstein-files-memo-maga-conspiracies-rcna217457) who were certain [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/,) would reveal the sweeping conspiracy they all know was afoot. [Many are calling](https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/maga-media-eat-their-own-after-trump-administration-denies-their-epstein-conspiracy), convinced that she must be part of the cover-up. What exactly [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) is covering up is often left unsaid, but the fact is that [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) can’t deliver what the MAGA faithful wanted, because there is nothing to deliver. And that’s her whole problem.

To understand why, compare [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) to White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt. Like [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general)’s, Leavitt’s job is to frame [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) in the most hagiographic terms possible, insist that all his lies are true and insult the media. Unlike [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general), Leavitt doesn’t have to deliver anything; her job is just about the performance. But [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) supporters and their representatives in the far-right media — who have promised Epstein-related bombshells for years — expect something real from the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/). You can’t just acknowledge their conspiracy theories; you have to unmask the conspirators.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) can tell [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) to investigate his critics and she can obey, which is what [appears to be happening](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/trump-administration-targets-comey-brennan-new-investigation-rcna217713) with former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) Director James Comey and former [CIA](https://www.cia.gov/) Director John Brennan. And she can continue helping [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) degrade and [corrupt](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/14/politics/bondi-justice-department-trump-qatar-747) her department, which will surely earn her a harsh judgment from history. But to preserve her good standing with MAGA, she’ll have to produce the results MAGA demands. And that looks increasingly impossible.
