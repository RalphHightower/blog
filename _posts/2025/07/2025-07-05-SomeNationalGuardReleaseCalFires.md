title: "Trump Released Some of His 'Toy Soldiers', CalGuard (National Guard) From Los Angeles Police Duty to Fight California Wildfires"
---


## [Some National Guard troops from Trump’s illiberal publicity stunt in L.A. are being reassigned](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/los-angeles-national-guard-firefighting-wildfires-ice-raids-rcna216280)

(A [National Guard commander](https://www.nationalguard.mil/) had requested that some of the troops [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) deployed for his [Los Angeles](https://lacity.gov/) crackdown be allowed to return to firefighting.*

July 1, 2025, 3:40 PM EDT
By [Ja'han Jones](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jahan-jones-ncpn371241)

At the [National Guard](https://www.nationalguard.mil/)’s request, the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) is reassigning some of the [troops](https://calguard.ca.gov/) deployed to Los Angeles as part of [Donald Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-racism-bigotry-ogles-zohran-mamdani-maga-rcna215644)’s [authoritarian publicity stunt](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) so they can instead address a real crisis — rather than the fake crisis of unrest that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has tried to fabricate.

The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) deployed [thousands of guard members](https://calguard.ca.gov/,) to [California](https://www.ca.gov/) last month in an illiberal show of force against demonstrators opposed to his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s disturbing immigration raids. In dictatorial fashion, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said the deployment [was intended to “liberate” Los Angeles](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-mark-army-milestone-troops-deployed-los-angeles-2025-06-10/).

The deployment [was against the wishes](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/06/11/president-trump-agrees-hes-breaking-the-law-in-california-heres-the-evidence/) of [California](https://www.ca.gov/)’s [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [governor](https://www.gov.ca.gov/), [Gavin Newsom](https://www.gov.ca.gov/about/), and the [chief](https://www.lapdonline.org/office-of-the-chief-of-police/) of the [Los Angeles](https://lacity.gov/) [Police Department](https://www.lapdonline.org/) framed it as unnecessary, saying his officers [were fully equipped to handle any issues](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-california-national-guard-police-chief-rcna212582).

In other words, top officials in [California](https://www.ca.gov/) correctly portrayed this deployment as a waste of resources.

In other words, top officials in [California](https://www.ca.gov/) correctly portrayed this deployment as a waste of resources. And there’s been mounting criticism of the [troops](https://calguard.ca.gov/) being pulled from other duties, such as firefighting and drug enforcement work, as well as the expensive deployment of [thousands of guard members](https://calguard.ca.gov/) — when only a fraction of them have actually been on the ground in [L.A.](https://lacity.gov/)

With wildfire season in full swing, The [Associated Press](https://www.apnews.com/) reported Monday that the [Guard](https://www.nationalguard.mil/) had requested that [200 of the troops](https://calguard.ca.gov/) be allowed to return to their firefighting work — essentially, that [some of the troops](https://www.nationalguard.mil/) be relieved from acting as [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s toy soldiers. And it appears the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) is partially fulfilling that request.

According to a [news release](https://www.northcom.mil/Newsroom/Press-Releases/Article/4232021/task-force-51-releases-150-members-of-the-california-national-guard/) sent out Tuesday:

> *At the recommendation of [Gen. Gregory M. Guillot](https://www.northcom.mil/Leadership/Article-View/Article/3666098/general-gregory-m-guillot-usaf/), Commander, [U.S. Northern Command](https://www.northcom.mil/), and approved by the [Secretary of Defense](https://www.defense.gov/), Task Force 51 will release approximately 150 members of the [California National Guard](https://calguard.ca.gov/) from the Federal Protection mission today.*

The press release added that there will still be enough troops to “conduct our Federal Protection Mission” in [California](https://www.ca.gov/), meaning there will still be a large contingency of [National Guard troops](https://calguard.ca.gov/) and [Marines](https://www.marines.mil/) basically occupying [Los Angeles](https://lacity.gov/) at the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s direction.

But the fact that this request was made at all, and that the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) acknowledged these troops aren’t essential to their so-called mission, adds to the heap of evidence that this entire undertaking has been a massive waste of resources.
