## [Targeting Epstein's 'sweetheart' deal, Senate Trumpian forgets who was president in 2008](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/targeting-epsteins-sweetheart-deal-senate-republican-forgets-was-presi-rcna221432)

*[Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Markwayne Mullin (T-OK](https://www.mullin.senate.gov/) tried to rope [Barack Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) into [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s Jeffrey Epstein scandal. It went horribly awry.*

July 28, 2025, 8:00 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

It’s been a little weird to see just how many [Trumpians](https://www.gop.com/) have, in recent years, [forgotten who was president in 2020](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-keep-forgetting-was-president-2020-rcna168496) — a problem that [Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/)’s critics make [with surprising frequency](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3ltx6abp25k24). Last week, [Secretary of]() [Housing and Urban Development](https://www.hud.goc/) [Scott Turner]() went even further, suggesting that the former Democratic [president was also in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [in 2018](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/interest-rates-fed-trump-powell-republicans-economy-rcna221155). (He wasn’t.)

The problem, however, isn’t limited to [Trump Party](https://www.gop.com/) officials and [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/).

[Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Markwayne Mullin (T-OK)](https://www.mullin.senate.gov/) routinely appears in the media in order to defend[Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and the incumbent [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/), and on Sunday, the [Oklahoman](https://www.mullin.senate.gov/) did his best to peddle partisan talking points to CNN’s Jake Tapper related to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s Jeffrey Epstein scandal. Part of his pitch, however, went horribly awry. From his on-air comments:

> *Remember, there was a plea deal that was struck in 2009, way before I was in office, way before [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was even considering to be in office, way before [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) was in office, way before [Kash Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) was director — 2009, there was a sweetheart plea deal that was made underneath the [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) with Epstein. And that sweetheart [deal] has not been exposed.*

It fell to the “State of the Union” host to remind his guest and his viewers, “No, that’s not right.”

Unfortunately for the confused senator, Tapper was correct. Epstein did get a “sweetheart” deal, but it was in 2008; [Barack Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) wasn’t [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) in 2008; and the “sweetheart” deal was exposed years ago. The [Oklahoman](https://www.mullin.senate.gov/) made some specific points, each of which was plainly false.

Confronted with reality, [Mullin](https://www.mullin.senate.gov/) nevertheless again said [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) was [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) when Epstein got his plea deal, indifferent to the fact that he was obviously and demonstrably wrong.

Alas, the [Trump Party](https://www.gop.com/) lawmaker has plenty of company. [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Ted Cruz (T-TX)](https://www.cruz.senate.gov/) once blamed [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) [for the economic crash that happened in 2008](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/cruz-tries-blame-obama-2008-crash-msna586036), despite the fact that the [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) wasn’t in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) at the time. Similarly, there was a poll released several years ago that found that [nearly a third](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/21/obama-hurricane-katrina_n_3790612.html) of [Trumpians](https://www.gop.com/) in [Louisiana](https://www.louisiana.gov/) blamed [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) for the poor federal response to Hurricane Katrina — a storm that hit in August 2005, nearly four years before [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/)’s inauguration.

But what made [Mullin](https://www.mullin.senate.gov/)’s error even more notable was the fact that it offered a fresh opportunity to remind the public that it was [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) who [rewarded Alex Acosta](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/labor-secretary-alex-acosta-resigns-under-cloud-scandal-msna1251871) — the guy who [helped orchestrate](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/following-epsteins-arrest-trump-cabinet-sec-faces-resignation-calls-msna1250571) Epstein’s deal — with a [Cabinet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/) position in the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s first term.

This hasn’t played a prominent role in the public conversation about [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and Epstein, but the [Oklahoma Trumpian](https://www.mullin.senate.gov/) inadvertently reminded everyone about this, while trying and failing to smear [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) with an obvious calendar failure.

Oops.
