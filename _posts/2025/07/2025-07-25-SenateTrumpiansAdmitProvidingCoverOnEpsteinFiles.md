## [On Epstein, Senate Republican admits the party is trying to give Trump ‘cover’](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/epstein-senate-republican-admits-party-trying-give-trump-cover-rcna221110)

*As observer asked, in reference to the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, “What exactly do [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) need cover for?”*

July 25, 2025, 12:51 PM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

When it comes to transparency and disclosures in the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, arguably no [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) has been as aggressive as [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Ruben Gallego](https://www.gallego.senate.gov/). In fact, last week, the [Arizonan](https://www.gallego.senate.gov/) became the first senator to push a resolution to formally demand the release of documents from the [Justice Department](https://www.senate.gov/).

But because [Gallego](https://www.gallego.senate.gov/) is in the [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) minority, he had limited options to force a vote. He took the only credible step available to him: Last Thursday, [Gallego](https://www.gallego.senate.gov/) went to the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) floor and sought unanimous consent on his proposal. He knew, of course, that the effort would fail if only one [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) objected, [and one did](https://bsky.app/profile/fritschner.bsky.social/post/3lu6is5x2pc2x): Oklahoma’s [Markwayne Mullin](https://www.mullin.senate.gov/), an ardent [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) ally, balked.

Seven days later, as [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-epstein-maxwell-powell-tariffs-immigration-live-updates-rcna219894/rcrd85397?canonicalCard=true), the two faced off again:

> *[Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Ruben Gallego (D-AZ)](https://www.gallego.senate.gov/), reintroduced a resolution [Thursday] afternoon calling on the [Justice Department](https://www.senate.gov/) to release its files related to the Epstein probe. [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Markwayne Mullin (T-OK)](https://www.mullin.senate.gov/) also on the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) floor, objected to [Gallego](https://www.gallego.senate.gov/)’s resolution and introduced his own nonbinding measure calling for unsealing all grand jury materials in the investigation of Epstein — which [Gallego](https://www.gallego.senate.gov/) then objected to.*

In other words, [Gallego](https://www.gallego.senate.gov/) rejected a narrow and toothless [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) alternative after [Mullin](https://www.mullin.senate.gov/) rejected a more meaningful [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) effort. (The [Arizonan](https://www.gallego.senate.gov/) offered to back both resolutions, but the [Oklahoman](https://www.mullin.senate.gov/) wouldn’t take the deal.)

As part of the back and forth, however, [Mullin](https://www.mullin.senate.gov/) made an off-hand comment that stood out.

“I’m sure this would be handled just like any other thing \[the [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/)] have tried to go after like the baseless impeachments. Or the baseless special counsels. Or the unbelievable amount of charges they tried to file against the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/),” [Mullin said](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/lawmakers-leave-washington-democrats-epstein-recess-politics-desk-rcna220944). “I’m sure this would be handled the exact same way. What we’re simply wanting to do here is give [[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)] cover.”

For now, let’s not dwell on the fact that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s impeachments weren’t “baseless.” Let’s also skip past the fact that the incumbent [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) faced investigations from two special counsels — Robert Mueller and Jack Smith — and neither was “baseless.”

Rather, I’m interested in the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) senator’s acknowledgement that “we” are trying to give the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) “cover” in the Epstein scandal.

As [The New Republic asked](https://newrepublic.com/post/198410/republican-senator-mullin-killed-epstein-resolution-give-trump-cover), “What exactly do [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) need cover for?”

For now, the party has not tried to answer the question, though [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT)](https://www.murphy.senate.gov/) [noted via Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/chrismurphyct.bsky.social/post/3luqcjhgzhs2w) around the same time as the [Gallego](https://www.gallego.senate.gov/)/[Mullin](https://www.mullin.senate.gov/) exchange, “The number one priority of [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s is protecting [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). It’s not protecting you. It’s protecting him.”
