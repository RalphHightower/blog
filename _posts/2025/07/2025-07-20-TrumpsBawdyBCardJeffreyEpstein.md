## [As Trump threatens the WSJ over new Epstein report, his 'picture' claim looks sketchy](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-threatens-wsj-new-epstein-report-picture-claim-looks-sketchy-rcna219545)

Responding to a report about his former relationship with Epstein, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said, “I never wrote a picture in my life.” The record suggests otherwise.*

It’s not as if the political world needed an excuse to keep focusing on the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, but [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/) advanced the controversy [with its new report](https://www.wsj.com/politics/trump-jeffrey-epstein-birthday-letter-we-have-certain-things-in-common-f918d796) on a 2003 birthday album, collected by former Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, which reportedly included a letter bearing [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s name.

The letter, the [Journal](https://www.wsj.com/) reported, was “among the documents examined by [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) officials who investigated Epstein and Maxwell years ago, according to people who have reviewed the pages.” From the article:

> *The letter bearing [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s name, which was reviewed by the [Journal](https://www.wsj.com/), is bawdy — like others in the album. It contains several lines of typewritten text framed by the outline of a naked woman, which appears to be hand-drawn with a heavy marker. A pair of small arcs denotes the woman’s breasts, and the future president’s signature is a squiggly ‘Donald’ below her waist, mimicking pubic hair. The letter concludes: ‘Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret.’*

The fact that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and the late millionaire pedophile had a relationship is not new. In fact, not only have we all seen the [video footage](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/OrCdLnd_It8) of the two men hanging out, but as my MSNBC colleague [James Downie noted](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/epstein-trump-wall-street-journal-letter-rcna219501), in 2002, a year before the birthday album came together, [Trump told New York magazine](https://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/n_7912/#print), “I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.” Years later, [he said](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-epstein-called-epstein-files-say-relationship-rcna161354) the two had a falling out and that they hadn't been in touch for 15 years before Epstein's death in 2019.

But in light of the ongoing controversy, [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/)’s reporting about the 2003 letter — which has not been independently verified by MSNBC — delivered another jolt to the political world about a story the White House desperately wants to go away.

For his part, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has had quite a bit to say about the newspaper’s reporting, publishing separate items to his social media platform, explaining that he initially [tried to convince](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)/114871422727186590) the [Journal](https://www.wsj.com/) not to publish the report, and after his appeals were ignored, he [announced plans to file a lawsuit](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)/114871752316281496).

In the latter missive, the [president](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wrote, in reference to the letter attributed to him, “These are not my words, not the way I talk. Also, I don’t draw pictures.” The [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) made similar on-the-record comments to the [Journal](https://www.wsj.com/), which quoted him saying, “This is not me. This is a fake thing. It’s a fake [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/) story. I never wrote a picture in my life. I don’t draw pictures of women. It’s not my language. It’s not my words.”

I won’t pretend to know where this story is headed, but if a core element of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s defense is that he’s never before drawn a picture, this sounds a bit sketchy.

[The New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/28/us/trump-manhattan-skyline-drawing-auction.html) during the [president](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s first term, for example, on a 2005 sketch of the [Manhattan](https://www.nyc.gov/site/cau/community-boards/manhattan-boards.page) skyline that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) drew and signed, which sold at auction for more than $29,000. He signed other drawings [that also sold](https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/11/donald-trump-drawing-sold-for-thousands) for considerable sums.

What’s more, in his 2008 book, “Never Give Up,” [Trump wrote](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-drawings-scrutiny-jeffrey-epstein-birthday-letter-2100562) about his annual habit of donating autographed “doodles” to be auctioned for charity.

All of which suggests the first draft of the [president](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s defense still needs some work.
