title: "America Under Trump’s Autocracy Is Not the America That I Know and Love"

[America](https://www.usa.gov/) under [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s autocratic rule is not the [America](https://www.usa.gov/) that I know and love.

I use [5 Calls](https://www.5calls.org/)[^11] to contact my legislators, but I feel like I'm *"beating a dead horse"*.

## [Americans are feeling less patriotic during Trump’s second term](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/american-proud-patriotism-gallup-poll-trump-racism-rcna216616)

*A new poll showed fewer [Americans](https://www.usa.gov/) than ever feel “very” or “extremely” proud to be [Americans](https://www.usa.gov/). That got me thinking about my own sense of patriotism.*

July 5, 2025, 6:00 AM EDT

By Anthony L. Fisher, Senior Editor, [MSNBC Daily](https://www.msnbc.com/)

A [new Gallup poll](https://news.gallup.com/poll/692150/american-pride-slips-new-low.aspx) shows just 58% of [Americans](https://www.usa.gov/) say they’re “extremely proud” or “very proud” to be [Americans](https://www.usa.gov/) — the lowest level recorded since [Gallup](https://www.gallup.com/) first asked this question in January 2001, when 87% self-described as extremely or very proud. That number would bump up to over 90% after the 9/11 terrorist attacks eight months later and stay roughly at that level until 2004, when the tragedy, folly and national shame of the [Iraq](https://ur.gov.iq/) [War](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/iraq-war) became too evident for even the most patriotic [Americans](https://www.usa.gov/) to ignore.

> *The ‘my country, right or wrong’ brand of patriotism never made sense to me.*

To be sure, a sizable majority of [Americans](https://www.usa.gov/) still says they’re super-proud to be [Americans](https://www.usa.gov/). And [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) currently poll at 92% as extremely or very proud, having never dropped below 84% (in 2022) during the 24 years of polling available. But just 36% of [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) and 53% of independents are at least very proud, a sharp drop from 87% and 84%, respectively, in early 2001.

I rarely ask myself questions like “How proud are you to be an [American](https://www.usa.gov/)?” but in the spirit of [America](https://www.usa.gov/)’s birthday weekend, I’ll give it the old frontier try.

First off, the “my country, right or wrong” brand of patriotism never made sense to me. Why couldn’t I be ashamed of some of [America](https://www.usa.gov/)’s immutable sins — centuries of chattel slavery and the ethnic cleansing of [Native Americans](https://www.bia.gov/) come to mind — while also feeling a sense of pride in the country’s ability to consistently evolve for the better? Why can’t I be both mortified at the bloody, history-changing stupidity that was [George W. Bush](https://www.georgewbushlibrary.gov/)’s [Iraq](https://ur.gov.iq/) [War](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/iraq-war) and proud that both of my grandfathers fought the Nazis in World War II?

But I still can’t really get a sense of where I fall on the patriotism spectrum based strictly on historical events. When I think of what makes me uniquely proud to be an [American](https://www.usa.gov/), it’s things like the generally accepted reverence for the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/). We don’t do kings. Our government has checks and balances. Bad actors can be removed from office.

I’m proud of [America](https://www.usa.gov/)’s tradition of freedom of speech that to this day is considered radical even in much of the “free world.” Our [First Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/) protects the right to express so-called offensive speech — be it worthless, rancid hate speech or politically unpopular agitation for civil rights. The freedom to express both poles of thought and everything in between is what makes the [First Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/) so radical — and so just.

It also protects the right to [freedom of the press](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/), which has been buttressed by [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) rulings that make it very plain that the onus to prove defamation is on the complainant — not the journalist or publisher. That’s how we report on the [government](https://www.usa.gov/) and the rich and powerful without being automatically destroyed by said forces.

And I’m proud of how [America](https://www.usa.gov/) — though it is often painfully slow to progress — regularly makes massive leaps in tolerance and expanding human rights.

But in July 2025, all those things that make me proud of [America](https://www.usa.gov/) are under threat. Worse, they’re under threat from [Americans](https://www.usa.gov/).

[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), an unrepentant racist, has helped re-normalize rank bigotry. To cite one of innumerable examples, his close confidant [Laura Loomer](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/laura-loomers-white-house-access-erases-line-fringe-mainstream-rcna210863) commented this week on [X](https://x.com/) that the so-called Alligator Alcatraz migrant detention center in the [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/) [Everglades](https://www.nps.gov/ever/) could provide “[at least 65 million meals](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/laura-loomer-alcatraz-alligator-lives-matter-trump-b2782150.html)” to the alligators. (That figure [roughly corresponds](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11292280/) to the Latino population of the U.S.)

And at an event Thursday meant to kickoff a year's worth of festivities commemorating [America](https://www.usa.gov/)'s Semiquincentennial, the [president used an ancient antisemitic slur](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/jewish-leaders-decry-president-trumps-use-shylocks-describe-money-lend-rcna216950) when referring to unscrupulous bankers. At the same event, he [he said of congressional Democrats](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5385217-trump-on-democrats-who-voted-against-gop-megabill-i-hate-them/) who didn't vote for his megabill: “I hate them, too. You know that? I really do, I hate them. I cannot stand them, because I really believe they hate our country.”

I can’t say the renaissance of shameless expressions of hate and racism makes me proud to be an [American](https://www.usa.gov/).

In July 2025, all those things that make me proud of [America](https://www.usa.gov/) are under threat. Worse, they’re under threat from [Americans](https://www.usa.gov/).

The same goes for the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) and MAGA movement’s war on the press — including the [blackmailing of corporate parent companies to settle bogus lawsuits with blatant shakedown money](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/paramount-settles-trump-cbs-news-60-minutes-lawsuit-rcna203667), threats to imprison reporters for [reporting on government documents](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/pete-hegseth-press-conference-trump-iran-nuclear-rcna215387) and [brain-poisoning of their followers](https://www.rawstory.com/tulsi-gabbard-2672599058/) into believing that things like asking for comment are “harassment.”

The fact that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) of the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) [attempted a self-coup](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-jan-6-rioters-pardons-back-the-blue-rcna188849) based on a completely made-up and thoroughly discredited lie, escaped prosecution because his lawyers used due process to delay the proceedings until the election and then was re-elected after promising the same kind of tyranny he’s dutifully doling out on the country — those don't really make me all that proud, either.

If asked the same question [Gallup](https://www.gallup.com/) asked of its poll subjects, I’d probably answer that I was “moderately” proud to be an American. Whether my fellow [Americans](https://www.usa.gov/) willfully tolerate the growing authoritarianism under which we live — or whether we refuse to be ruled by a [dim despot](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) — will surely determine which direction on that spectrum I’ll land in the future. I haven’t given up on [America](https://www.usa.gov/). I’m just not sure yet if America has given up on itself.
