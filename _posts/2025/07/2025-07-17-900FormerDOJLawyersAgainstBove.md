title: "Trump’s Sycophantic Defense Lawyer, Emil Bove, Is Unfit For a Lifetime Judgeship"

## [Why Emil Bove's nomination has driven hundreds of lawyers to speak out](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/emil-bove-trump-federal-judge-nomination-senate-letter-rcna219169)

*The nominee for a lifetime federal judgeship has demonstrated a total disregard for the high ethical standards to which most federal prosecutors hold themselves.*

July 17, 2025, 6:00 AM EDT
By Mimi Rocah, former district attorney of Westchester County, New York

Well over 300 federal, [Article III](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/article-3/) judges across the country are [former federal prosecutors](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/watch/-the-worst-conceivable-nominee-hear-federal-prosecutors-sound-off-on-trump-s-judicial-choice-242891333639). They have been nominated by [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) and [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [presidents](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) in larger numbers than any other group of lawyers. And yet I cannot recall [such fierce](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/analysis/emil-bove-whistleblower-justice-department-email-confirmation-rcna218110) and [widespread opposition](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/emil-bove-trump-doj-judge-nomination-rcna214722) to a [former prosecutor’s nomination](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/prosecuting-donald-trump/not-normal-rcna218663) — not just [from a range](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/emil-bove-senate-questions-third-circuit-eric-adams-danielle-sassoon-b0d10693?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAisaiqKSk7122pcBe1GVuQINinyNiNyg8_PhMx8vXoEqw_TGa4ziXYV3K8LGlI%3D&gaa_ts=686f2754&gaa_sig=8y1Hg-tFmbPzVMLNIoSbSI2S0WCJ2DVxBgdSei3qxL0eeleDL9WE-WhvLo1FRuK0rFLmW2ZB5wWrAOXWPHg8RA%3D%3D) of [ideological backgrounds](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/29/opinion/bove-trump-judges-confirmation.html), not just from the [legal community](https://societyfortheruleoflaw.org/wp-content/uploads/Emil-Bove-Letter-Society-for-the-Rule-of-Law-Institute-.pdf) [generally](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/16/opinion/emil-bove-trump-loyalty.html), but from [more than 900](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/hundreds-doj-alumni-warn-senate-against-trumps-appellate-judge-nominee-2025-07-16/) former [Justice Department](https://www.thejusticeconnection.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Bove-Nomination-DOJ-Letter.pdf) [attorneys and](https://www.yahoo.com/news/former-doj-prosecutors-seek-derail-233020639.html) [former judges](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25997817-former-judges-call-on-senate-committee-to-reject-emil-boves-nomination/) — until the nomination of [Emil Bove](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emil-bove-0113347/).

> *[Bove](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emil-bove-0113347/) has demonstrated a total disregard for the high ethical standards to which most federal prosecutors hold themselves.*

[Bove](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emil-bove-0113347/) is a former [Southern District of [
New York](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny) prosecutor-turned-[Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) defense lawyer, now serving as the principal associate deputy attorney general at the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/), and he previously was the acting deputy attorney general. He has been nominated by [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) for a lifetime seat on the [3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals](https://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/), and the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Judiciary Committee](http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/) is set to vote this week on whether to advance his nomination to the full [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/).

Since his nomination, former federal prosecutors and judges have been ringing alarm bells with rare intensity and in great numbers opposing his nomination. Why? The short answer: [Bove](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emil-bove-0113347/) has demonstrated a total disregard for the high ethical standards to which most federal prosecutors hold themselves, and, perhaps worse, he has shown a complete disregard for other lawyers who refuse to do the same.

First, there was [Bove](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emil-bove-0113347/)’s conduct undoing the prosecutions of [Jan. 6 Capitol rioters]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}) and punishing those public servants who had been part of the prosecutions. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s pardon dismissals — which [Bove](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emil-bove-0113347/) helped make happen — of thousands of prosecutions by a prior [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) that included trial verdicts, guilty pleas, lengthy sentencing proceedings by judges, months of hard work and sweat by prosecutors and federal agents, is not just bad practice by the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/); it’s a slap in the face to those public servants who worked on these cases and the law enforcement officers injured and traumatized by the events of that day.


Even more shocking, [Bove](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emil-bove-0113347/) led a politically motivated purge of law enforcement professionals who worked on the cases. [He was instrumental](https://www.sidebarsblog.com/p/the-bove-nomination) in the firing of prosecutors who worked on cases because of the claim that they could not be trusted to carry out “[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s agenda” — something that should have no place in employment decisions of federal prosecutors — and he was behind the firing [of FBI agents](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/05/g-s1-46641/fbi-january-6-fired-justice) who had done nothing more than work on cases to which they were assigned. [He claimed](https://apnews.com/article/emil-bove-trump-fbi-enforcer-firings-3f85887e92154b14f7e04cfc521a0399) that these public servants participated “in what the president appropriately described as a ‘grave national injustice’ that has been perpetrated upon the American people.” And [Bove](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emil-bove-0113347/) did all of this despite the fact that as a national security prosecutor in the [Southern District of New York](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny), he had [worked on](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/trumps-feared-doj-enforcer-secret-investigated-jan-6-rcna191796) these very same cases.
In his role as acting deputy attorney general, [Bove](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emil-bove-0113347/) orchestrated a brazen dismissal of criminal charges against [New York Mayor Eric Adams](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/nyregion/danielle-sassoon-quit-eric-adams.html), in what appeared to be a quid pro quo, in exchange for his cooperation with the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) in immigration enforcement efforts. As if that were not bad enough, he tried to force other prosecutors into compliance.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s interim U.S. attorney in [SDNY](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny), as well as several other prosecutors in [New York](https://www.ny.gov/), resigned over the episode, stating that it would violate [their ethical](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-doj-danielle-sassoon-sdny-eric-adams-rcna192273) and [legal obligations](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/22/nyregion/prosecutor-letter.html) to be part of this dismissal. [Bove](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emil-bove-0113347/) [then reportedly assembled](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/justice-department-office-prosecutes-public-corruption-slashed-size-so-rcna195928) members of the [Public Integrity Section](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-pin) at the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) and threatened disciplinary action, including possible firing, if one of them did not sign the motion to dismiss — something I have never heard of happening under any [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) leader prior to this. One career attorney who was near retirement ultimately agreed to sign the motion in order to save his colleagues.

> *In his role as acting deputy attorney general, [Bove](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emil-bove-0113347/) orchestrated a brazen dismissal of criminal charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams.*

[Judge Dale Ho](https://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/hon-dale-e-ho) ultimately dismissed the [Adams](https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/index.page) case, noting that he could not force the government to prosecute, but he dismissed it with prejudice, meaning the charges cannot be refiled, rather than without prejudice as the government had requested (which would have allowed the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) to continue to hold the charges over [Adams](https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/index.page)’ head). The judge wrote a [blistering opinion](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/nyregion/eric-adams-case-dismissed.html?unlocked_article_code=1.WE8.JWrY.-vzXiqvqm_fl&smid=url-share) and [agreed that](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/eric-adams-corruption-charges-dismissed-judge-dale-ho-rcna199403) the attempted dismissal by [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) and [Bove](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emil-bove-0113347/) appeared to be part of a corrupt deal between [Adams](https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/index.page) and the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/). He also found, contrary to [Bove](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emil-bove-0113347/)’s representations, there was absolutely no evidence prosecutors had done anything improper by bringing the case and called [Bove](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emil-bove-0113347/)’s argued reasons for dismissal “pretextual.”

This kind of critique by a federal judge of one’s integrity would humble if not shame most federal prosecutors — but not [Bove](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emil-bove-0113347/).

Most recently, a [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) whistleblower has made serious allegations about [Bove](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emil-bove-0113347/)’s role in deliberate defiance of the very federal bench that he now seeks to join.

[Erez Reuveni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erez-reuveni-5b796b18/), a 15-year veteran [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) prosecutor who litigated some of the most divisive cases the department has ever defended and was promoted under [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), was then fired because he dared to tell a [federal judge the truth](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/justice-department-prosecutor-erez-reuveni-put-on-leave-maryland-mistaken-deportation-case-el-salvador/): that Kilmar Abrego Garcia was deported to [El Salvador](https://www.gob.sv/)’s CECOT prison by mistake.

[Reuveni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erez-reuveni-5b796b18/) has filed a [whistleblower complaint](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25982164/file-2477.pdf), which includes a great deal of [damaging information](https://www.justsecurity.org/116777/bove-criminal-contempt-boasberg/) about the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s disregard for due process and defiance of the courts and about [Bove](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emil-bove-0113347/)’s leadership of those efforts. The complaint discusses a meeting at the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) in mid-March — after the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) decided to rely upon the [Alien Enemies Act](https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/alien-and-sedition-acts) to deport the [Venezuelan](https://gob.ve/) immigrants — at which [Bove](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emil-bove-0113347/) said that the deportations were a “highest priority” for the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and that the planes with the [Venezuelans](https://gob.ve/) would be taking off in the next 24 to 48 hours “no matter what.”

In the most explosive allegation, [Reuveni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erez-reuveni-5b796b18/) reported that [Bove](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emil-bove-0113347/) said that if they were confronted with a court order to halt the deportations, they would need to consider telling the court “fuck you” and continuing anyway — which is exactly what happened. During an emergency hearing as the flights were about to take off, [Chief U.S. District Judge Boasberg](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/chief-judge-james-e-boasberg) of the [District of Columbia](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/) ordered that the deportations be halted and that any planes already on their way be ordered to turn back. The government defied that order, the planes landed, and the immigrants were sent to the supermax prison. During his confirmation hearing, [Bove denied](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/25/us/politics/emil-bove-confirmation.html) advocating defiance of the courts and claimed he could not recall using vulgar language, [but emails](https://www.justsecurity.org/116777/bove-criminal-contempt-boasberg/) strongly corroborate [Reuveni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erez-reuveni-5b796b18/)’s description.

When [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) nominated [Bove](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emil-bove-0113347/), [the president said](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)/posts/114587010981213926) said [Bove](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emil-bove-0113347/) would “do anything else that is necessary to, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.” That is not a qualification for prosecutors or federal judges, who should do everything they can to uphold the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/) and act with integrity and candor consistent with legal ethics, even if it conflicts with a political agenda. Violating these principles is bad enough, but trying to coerce other attorneys of integrity to do so for your own political gain, as Bove has, is unforgivable.
