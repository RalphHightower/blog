## [Trump clings to discredited claim while announcing new Canada tariffs](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-clings-discredited-claim-announcing-new-canada-tariffs-rcna218260)

*The American [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is intensifying his trade war against an generational ally because of a misguided claim about fentanyl.*

July 11, 2025, 11:15 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

The plan, by all appearances, was for trade representatives from the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) and [Canada](https://www.canada.ca/) to continue with trade negotiations in the hope of reaching a compromise both countries could accept. Then [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) decided to make [a dramatic announcement](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-us-canada-imports-35-tariff-trade-war-mark-carney-rcna218182) in the midst of the talks. [The New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/10/us/politics/trump-canada-tariffs.html):

> *[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) threatened on Thursday to impose a 35 percent tariff on [Canadian](https://www.canada.ca/) imports, upending negotiations between the countries that had [Canada](https://www.canada.ca/)’s representatives hopeful that a trade deal could be reached in a matter of weeks. Mr. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) posted a letter to [Prime Minister](https://www.pm.gc.ca/) [Mark Carney](https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/about) of [Canada](https://www.canada.ca/) on social media outlining his latest threat. He said the new, higher tariff rate for [Canada](https://www.canada.ca/) would go into effect on Aug. 1.*

As is often the case with announcements from the American [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), plenty of questions do not yet have answers. Will [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) abandon [this new threat](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)/posts/114831716625825473), as he’s done repeatedly in recent months? Would the tariffs apply to all [Canadian](https://www.canada.ca/) goods? Would these new tariffs violate existing trade treaties and our obligations under the [World Trade Organization](https://www.wto.org/)? For now, it’s not entirely clear, though there's been [some reporting](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/11/trump-announces-35percent-tariffs-on-canada-starting-aug-1.html) that the policy wouldn't apply to the existing North American trade agreement.

We do know, however, how the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) tried to justify his latest move.

“If [Canada](https://www.canada.ca/) works with me to stop the flow of Fentanyl, we will, perhaps, consider an adjustment to this letter,” [Trump wrote at the end of his correspondence](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-us-canada-imports-35-tariff-trade-war-mark-carney-rcna218182).

In recent months, the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has struggled to come up with a consistent rationale for the tariffs [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) apparently wants to impose. Sometimes, it’s about immigration; other times, the trade deficit. Occasionally, the focus has been on drugs, other times tax policies.

The problem with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s latest claim about fentanyl, however, is that it’s plainly false — as he really ought to know by now.

“The excuse that he’s giving for these tariffs today of fentanyl is completely bogus, completely unjustified, completely false,” then-[Prime Minister](https://www.pm.gc.ca/) [Justin Trudeau declared](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/world/canada/trump-trudeau-canada-51st-state.html) declared earlier in the year. “What he wants is to see a total collapse of the [Canadian](https://www.canada.ca/) economy, because that’ll make it easier to annex us.”

That was an extraordinary comment for a variety of reasons, but his assessment about fentanyl rang true. In fact, according to [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/), [only 43 pounds of fentanyl](https://newrepublic.com/post/192379/donald-trump-press-secretary-karoline-leavitt-tariff-defense) were found crossing the northern border in 2024 — in contrast to 21,100 pounds seized at the southern border.

It’s obviously silly to think a country would launch a trade war against a neighbor — and generational ally — over fentanyl that could fit in a single suitcase, but [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) apparently has this misguided idea stuck in his head.
