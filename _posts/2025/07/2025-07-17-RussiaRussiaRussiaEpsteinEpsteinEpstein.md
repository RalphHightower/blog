## [Why Trump shouldn’t try to draw parallels between his Epstein and Russian scandals](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-shouldnt-try-draw-parallels-epstein-russian-scandals-rcna219377)

*If the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) believes the [Russia](http://government.ru/) scandal and the Epstein scandal are of equal validity, then the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has a real problem on its hands.*

July 17, 2025, 1:07 PM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

At an [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) event on Wednesday, [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) fielded some questions from [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) reporters, many of whom pressed the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) on the major topic of the day. “[Mr. President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), will you ask [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jeffrey-epstein-files-trump-pam-bondi-briefing-rcna218948) to release more documents to finally put this controversy to an end?” one asked, referring to the Jeffrey Epstein controversy.

As part of his response, the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) eventually got around to saying the story is “no different than [Russia](http://government.ru/), [Russia](http://government.ru/), [Russia](http://government.ru/).”

It was a familiar refrain. In fact, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) made a nearly identical claim [earlier in the day](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)/114863203348237352). And [the day before](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-press-gaggle-before-marine-one-departure-july-15-2025/). And [a few days before that](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-interview-lara-trump-my-view-fox-news-july-12-2025/). And [two days before that](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)/114829111657785430).

The point, evidently, is relatively straightforward: The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is facing allegations related to the late alleged sex trafficker, which has led him to effectively argue that if the [Russia](http://government.ru/) scandal was fake, the Epstein scandal should necessarily be seen as fake, too.

For those who’ve read [my second book](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/ministry-of-truth-steve-benen?variant=42060890374178), this probably sounds familiar. Indeed, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has made this same pitch repeatedly in recent years. When he was accused of illegally bringing classified documents to [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/), he said the case was “just like [RUSSIA](http://government.ru/), [RUSSIA](http://government.ru/), [RUSSIA](http://government.ru/).” When the [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) [attorney general](https://ag.ny.gov/)’s office accused the [Trump Organization](https://www.trump.com/) of [fraudulent business practices on a systemic scale]({% link NuisanceTelephoneCalls.md %}), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) declared: “This is like [Russia](http://government.ru/), [Russia](http://government.ru/), [Russia](http://government.ru/).” When the [Jan. 6 committee](https://www.govinfo.gov/committee/house-january6th?path=/browsecommittee/chamber/house/committee/january6th/collection/CRPT)’s report came out, he said the panel’s members were not to be trusted — because they believed “the [RUSSIA](http://government.ru/), [RUSSIA](http://government.ru/), [RUSSIA](http://government.ru/) HOAX.”

For the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), this line has been a get-out-of-trouble-free card for years, to be played ad nauseam: If the [Russia](http://government.ru/) scandal wasn’t real, the argument goes, then voters should necessarily discount every other controversy related to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).

There are two rather important flaws with the argument. The first is that logic doesn’t work this way: If someone is falsely accused of wrongdoing, it doesn’t mean that all future accusations must necessarily be seen as false.

The second problem is that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Russia](http://government.ru/) scandal is still real, no matter how many times he pretends otherwise.

Indeed, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s timing could be better: It was literally just last week when [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s handpicked [CIA](https://www.cia.gov/) director released the findings of an internal investigation that concluded, once again, that [Russia](http://government.ru/) attacked the U.S. political system in 2016 because [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/)’s regime wanted to put [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).

But if the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is determined to keep talking about this on a near-daily basis, perhaps now is a good time to review some basic truths about the [Russia](http://government.ru/) scandal, many of which are too often overlooked.

[Russia](http://government.ru/) attacked the American elections in 2016

Every U.S. intelligence agency and lawmakers from both parties have long agreed that the [Kremlin](http://kremlin.ru/) launched an [expansive and expensive](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trumps-dubious-pitch-russian-interference-was-inconsequential) covert military intelligence operation that targeted the U.S. political system in 2016. This basic fact is no longer contested — except by [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), who [publicly declared](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/even-now-trump-trusts-putin-over-leading-u-s-officials-n1270454) that he found [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/) more reliable than his own administration’s officials — and its importance is too often overlooked.

[Russia](http://government.ru/)’s goal was to put [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) in power

The [Kremlin](http://kremlin.ru/)’s operation was not politically neutral: [Moscow](http://kremlin.ru/) attacked our elections in the hopes of helping dictate the outcome. According to the findings of U.S. intelligence agencies, special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, and the multi-step investigation from the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/)-led [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Intelligence Committee](http://www.intelligence.senate.gov/), [Russia](http://government.ru/) saw [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) as a prospective ally and believed [it would be in its interests](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/obama-orders-review-of-russian-hacking-during-presidential-campaign/2016/12/09/31d6b300-be2a-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html) if the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) were in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).

[Russia](http://government.ru/) and [Team Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) were political allies

As regular readers [know](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/ron-johnson-tries-fails-blame-dems-crisis-ukraine-rcna18142), investigations from Mueller’s team and the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/)-led [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Intelligence Committee](http://www.intelligence.senate.gov/) documented the extent to which [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his team [welcomed, received and benefited from](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/report-details-team-trump-s-connections-russia-s-2016-scheme-n1237264) [Russian](http://government.ru/) campaign assistance. (They also obstructed the investigation into this assistance — by some measures, [10 times](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-ap-top-news-elections-james-comey-north-america-e0d125d737be4a21a81bec3d9f1dffd8).)

The evidence also showed there was coordination and high-level connections between [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s political operation and those responsible for the attack on our elections. The [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Intelligence Committee](http://www.intelligence.senate.gov/)’s report at one point literally described a “direct tie between [senior Trump Campaign officials](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and the [Russian](http://government.ru/) intelligence services.”

[Team Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) lied about its communications with [Russia](http://government.ru/)

No, really, [Team Trump lied about its communications with Russia](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/russian-contacts-team-trump-highlight-foundational-lie-msna1173316). A lot. Out loud and on record. Over and over again, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his spokespeople insisted there were absolutely no interactions between the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/), his political operation and their [Russian](http://government.ru/) benefactors. We now know definitively that [they were lying](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/russian-contacts-team-trump-highlight-foundational-lie-msna1173316) — and they’ve never been forthcoming about why.

The [Russia](http://government.ru/) scandal led to a series of felony convictions and prison sentences

For an alleged “hoax,” the [Russia](http://government.ru/) scandal led to an amazing number of federal prosecutions. In fact, the investigation [led to the convictions of](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/20/17031772/mueller-indictments-grand-jury), among others, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) national security adviser, campaign chairman, deputy campaign chairman, foreign policy adviser and personal lawyer, and to the indictment of [13 Russian nationals who interfered in our elections](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/special-counsel-mueller-charges-13-russians-interfering-2016-election-n848686) as part of the larger plot.

I realize, of course, that there are all kinds of contentious details and personalities related to the controversy, which are still being debated, years later, as part of the broader conversation about the story. But these core truths remain unambiguous: [Russia](http://government.ru/) attacked our elections to help [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). The [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)’s political operation welcomed, received, benefited from and lied about [Russia](http://government.ru/)n campaign assistance. Many key players from [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s inner circle were charged, prosecuted and convicted.

These aren’t opinions. They’re conclusions drawn from multiple, bipartisan investigations, conducted across several years.

If the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is of the opinion that the [Russia](http://government.ru/) scandal and the Epstein scandal are of equal validity, then the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) should prepare for the ongoing controversy to become even more dramatic.
