## [New Trump polls are in and his deportation and economic agendas are backfiring](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-polling-disapproval-rating-immigration-economy-rcna220922)

*[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) ran on immigration and the economy. Polls show most Americans don't like how either are going.*

Right now, the biggest political story in America is the [Jeffrey Epstein saga](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/epstein-files-trump-house-mike-johnson-rcna220266). But the most important political story in America is something else altogether — the [cratering popularity](https://www.msnbc.com/chris-jansing-reports/watch/poll-trump-s-approval-rating-drops-to-42-243567685760) of [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).

Look at any polling aggregator you want, [Real Clear Politics](https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/favorability/donald-trump), [Nate Silver](https://www.natesilver.net/p/trump-approval-ratings-nate-silver-bulletin) or [Elliott Morris](https://www.gelliottmorris.com/p/trumps-approval-hits-new-low-as-epstein). They all agree: [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is more unpopular than at any other point in his [presidency](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), and the numbers are getting worse.

Indeed, according to a new [Gallup](https://www.gallup.com/) poll that dropped Thursday morning, [Trump’s approval is at a rock bottom 37%](https://news.gallup.com/poll/692879/independents-drive-trump-approval-second-term-low.aspx) — and a measly 29% among independents.

But what is most striking about [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s sinking approval ratings are the reasons he’s unpopular. During the 2024 campaign, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) ran on a platform of anti-immigrant zealotry and mass deportation. He boasted that he was the man who could fix the U.S. economy and build support over public anger about rising inflation under [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/).

Yet, on both issues, the American people are souring on the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).

> *What is most striking about [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s sinking approval ratings are the reasons he’s unpopular.*

Take immigration, which was the centerpiece of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s 2024 campaign message and arguably the previous [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s most significant political vulnerability.

A recent [Gallup](https://www.gallup.com/) poll [gives Trump a 35% approval rating](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/13/politics/deportations-backfiring-trump-analysis) on immigration policy — with 62% disapproving. In fact, twice as many U.S. adults strongly disapprove of his handling of the issue as approve of it.

According to a recent [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/)/[YouGov](https://www.yougov.com/) poll, [there’s been a 20-point shift in support of Trump’s mass deportations policy since February](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-poll-trump-deportation-program-prices/) — with approval of the policy dropping from 59% to 49% and disapproval rising from 41% to 51%. Even more notable is a 10-point shift against the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) on mass deportations since June. It appears that as Americans see and hear more and more news stories about the excesses of [ICE agents](https://www.ice.gov/) and the tales of those caught up in [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s deportation dragnet, the less they like it.

[CNN polling](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/20/politics/cnn-poll-trump-deportations) finds a similar result, with nearly 6 in 10 U.S. adults opposed to deporting noncriminal undocumented immigrants and 57% balking at the construction of “detention facilities” like the so-called Alligator Alcatraz facility in [Florida](https://www.myflorida.com/).

But as bad as [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s numbers are on immigration, they are arguably worse on the economy.

A [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/)/[YouGov poll](https://data.ddhq.io/polls/2025/07/20/YouGov/CBS%20News-National-2025-07-16-2025-07-18) from earlier in the week asked U.S. adults how [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s policies were affecting them financially — 18% said better off, 32% said the same, and half, 50%, said worse.

As inflation steadily rises, there are signs that people are holding [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) responsible for the increasing prices. The same poll found that [a whopping 62%](https://x.com/JesseFFerguson/status/1947095826569863312) believe [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s policies are making food and groceries more expensive.

Indeed, when it comes to tariffs, the centerpiece of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s economic agenda, voters — even those who previously supported [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) — aren’t buying what he’s selling. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s numbers on inflation and rising prices have been among his worst-polling policy issues. [A Faux News poll](https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/07/fox_july-18-21-2025_national_topline_july-23-release.pdf) released Tuesday found 62% of voters disapprove of Trump’s handling of inflation.

What about the [“Big Beautiful Bill,”](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text) which was enacted earlier this month? For the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), perhaps the less said, the better, [but when 6 in 10 Americans — and even 1 in 5 Republicans — oppose the bill](http://youtube.com/live/ZLwJQvVMqAE?pp=0gcJCZYAKgI3ePta) — oppose the bill, that’s never a good sign.

Keep in mind, this isn’t even taking into account the Jeffrey Epstein controversy, which is a polling abyss for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). [Quinnipiac University survey from last week showed 63% of voters disapproved](https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3928) of how the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has handled the emerging scandal. Even among Republicans, only 40% gave [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) high marks on the issue.

If there’s one story that has the potential to weaken [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s bedrock support in MAGA world, it is the Epstein scandal. However, even if [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) can maintain his support among this seemingly unmovable cohort, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and his party are wading into treacherous political waters.

During his first term in office, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was often where he is today in public opinion polling — the low to mid-40s. Keep in mind, however, those lousy numbers contributed to the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) wipeout in the 2018 midterms and [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s re-election defeat in 2020.

The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and his party are wading into treacherous political waters.

If [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) can’t move the needle between now and next year, the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) could be looking at a midterm repeat defeat at the ballot box. And there’s little reason to expect the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) to shift course. With the infusion of billions of dollars to [Immigration and Customs Enforcement](https://www.ice.gov/) in the tax bill, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is looking to double down on his agenda of mass deportations. There’s no indication that he’s backing off his tariff threats, and the worst elements of the Big, Beautiful Bill have yet to trickle down to voters.

If the [Republican Party](https://www.gop.com/)’s political prospects continue to look dire, one can expect to see the impact play out in [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) fundraising and recruitment of candidates and potentially more retirements. Conversely, [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) will have a far easier time recruiting viable candidates to challenge [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) and raise the money they need to compete effectively.

For much of the past year, political pundits have been focused on the [Democratic Party](https://www.democrats.org/)’s need to find a new message after the trauma of the 2024 election. However, it seems increasingly clear that — as was the case in [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s first term — “we’re not [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)” will likely have a pretty good ring to it.
