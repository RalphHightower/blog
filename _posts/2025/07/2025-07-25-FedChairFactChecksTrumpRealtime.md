## [Trump struggles with facts as Fed Chair Jerome Powell corrects him in real time](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-struggles-facts-fed-chair-jerome-powell-corrects-real-time-rcna221052)

*It was not a flattering moment for a [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) who routinely makes up figures but who is rarely fact-checked by his appointees on camera.*

July 25, 2025, 9:52 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

To an unprecedented degree, [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has lobbied his handpicked [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) chairman, [Jerome Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm), to lower interest rates. The heavy-handed tactics, which have unfolded in recent months in public and private, haven’t had much of an effect, which in turn has generated no shortage of frustration in the [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).

Indeed, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has resorted to [juvenile taunts and name-calling](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/inflation-picked-june-trumps-trade-tariffs-pushed-prices-higher-rcna218891), publicly condemning [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) as, among many other things, a “moron” for failing to follow [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s misguided demands.

Having exhausted his usual bullying tactics, the [Trumpian](https://www.gop.com/) and his team began exploring alternative ways to gain leverage over the largely independent [Fed chair](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm). Recently, this led the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) in an unexpected direction: [Team Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) decided to [focus on building renovations](https://apnews.com/article/powell-trump-federal-reserve-16a3a78bab27f44e058d69829a8dcfa9) at the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/), with the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) suggesting that cost overruns might constitute grounds to fire [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm), who has ignored calls to resign.

So on Thursday [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) made [a historically unusual visit](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-epstein-maxwell-powell-tariffs-immigration-live-updates-rcna219894/rcrd85375?canonicalCard=true) to the [Fed’s headquarters](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) in Washington, D.C., presumably to add a fresh round of pressure. This did not go as well for the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) as it could have.

During the visit, for example, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [flubbed basic details](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/07/24/us/trump-federal-reserve-powell/a68b03fd-017b-59ce-99cd-e07f1ccebf1c?smid=url-share) about developments at the [European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html), which he pretended to know something about. Around the same time, the [Trumpian](https://www.gop.com/) made specific boasts about the impact of a rate cut, [which were quickly discredited](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/07/24/us/trump-federal-reserve-powell/fac76c17-6fc6-557c-9df8-b30a174061d1?smid=url-share).

But those comments only set the stage for the pièce de résistance. As [The New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/24/us/politics/trump-powell-real-estate.html):

> *The chair of the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) closed his eyes and shook his head. He was about to do something that few senior government officials ever do, at least in public: fact-check [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) in real time.*

This is one of those stories in which [watching the video](https://bsky.app/profile/sahilkapur.bsky.social/post/3luqgkem3lc26) is necessary to fully appreciate what transpired.

During brief remarks with reporters, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), with [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) standing just inches away, declared that cost overruns on the project have reached “about $3.1 billion.” The [Fed chair](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) could be seen immediately and rapidly shaking his head, making clear to those in attendance that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was citing a number that wasn’t true.

“I’m not aware of that,” [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) interrupted. The figure, the [Trumpian](https://www.gop.com/) responded, “just came out.”

Moments later, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) tried to justify his claim, pulling a document from his jacket pocket and handing it to the [Fed chair](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm). [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) quickly reviewed the data and noticed an important flaw.

“You just added in a third building,” [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) said.

“It’s a building that’s being built,” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) replied.

“No, it was built five years ago,” the [Fed chair](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) reminded him. “It’s not new.”

Oops.

Jul 25, 2025  [#JoeScarborough](https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe) [#JeromePowell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) [#Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)
[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) visited the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) with [Chair Jerome Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) and [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Tim Scott](https://www.scott.senate.gov/) amid weeks of claims that the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/)’s renovation costs were fraudulently inflated. But during the tour, [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) corrected [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s $3.1B figure on camera, pointing out the project included a building completed years ago. The [Morning Joe](https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe) panel breaks down the awkward exchange, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s push to lower interest rates, and what it reveals about the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s broader strategy.

It was not a flattering moment for a [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) who routinely makes up figures but who is rarely fact-checked by his own appointees on camera. Indeed, one of the more notable elements of the exchange was that [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) didn’t seem to care at all about [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s delicate ego or fear of public humiliation.

As for the underlying issue, it’s true that the renovation project is over budget, but as [The Associated Press reported](https://apnews.com/article/powell-trump-federal-reserve-16a3a78bab27f44e058d69829a8dcfa9) last week, it was [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) appointees, not [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm), who pushed for elements that raised costs.
