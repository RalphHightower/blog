July 30, 2025

Federal Reserve issues FOMC statement
For release at 2:00 p.m. EDT

Although swings in net exports continue to affect the data, recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year. The unemployment rate remains low, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated.

The [Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated. The [Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.

In support of its goals, the [Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the [Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The [Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) will continue reducing its holdings of [Treasury securities](https://home.treasury.gov/services/bonds-and-securities) and agency debt and [agency mortgage‑backed securities](https://home.treasury.gov/services/bonds-and-securities). The [Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.

In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the [Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The [Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the [Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm)'s goals. The [Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm)'s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.

Voting for the monetary policy action were [Jerome H. Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm), Chair; [John C. Williams](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/federal-reserve-system-new-york.htm), Vice Chair; [Michael S. Barr](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/barr.htm); [Susan M. Collins](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/federal-reserve-system-boston.htm); [Lisa D. Cook](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/cook.htm); [Austan D. Goolsbee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/federal-reserve-system-chicago.htm); [Philip N. Jefferson](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/jefferson.htm); [Alberto G. Musalem](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/federal-reserve-system-st-louis.htm); and [Jeffrey R. Schmid](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/federal-reserve-system-kansas-city.htm). Voting against this action were [Michelle W. Bowman](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/bowman.htm) and [Christopher J. Waller](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/waller.htm), who preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point at this meeting. Absent and not voting was [Adriana D. Kugler](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/kugler.htm).

Implementation Note issued July 30, 2025

## [Federal Reserve Board - Implementation Note issued July 30, 2025](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20250730a1.htm)

### Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation

The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy stance announced by the [Federal Open Market Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) in its statement on July 30, 2025:

- The [Board of Governors](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/default.htm) of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to maintain the interest rate paid on reserve balances at 4.4 percent, effective July 31, 2025.
- As part of its policy decision, the [Federal Open Market Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) voted to direct the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:

    "Effective July 31, 2025, the [Federal Open Market Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) directs the Desk to:

    - Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 4-1/4 to 4‑1/2 percent.
    - Conduct standing overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 4.25 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of \$160 billion per day.
    - Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 4.5 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of \$500 billion.
    - Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of [Treasury securities](https://home.treasury.gov/services/bonds-and-securities) maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of \$5 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap.
    - Reinvest the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and [agency mortgage‑backed securities](https://home.treasury.gov/services/bonds-and-securities) (MBS) received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of \$35 billion per month into [Treasury securities](https://home.treasury.gov/services/bonds-and-securities) to roughly match the maturity composition of [Treasury securities](https://home.treasury.gov/services/bonds-and-securities) outstanding.
    - Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons."
- In a related action, the [Board of Governors](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/default.htm) of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to approve the establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 4.5 percent.

This information will be updated as appropriate to reflect decisions of the [Federal Open Market Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) or the [Board of Governors](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/default.htm) regarding details of the Federal Reserve's operational tools and approach used to implement monetary policy.
