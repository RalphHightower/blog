## [Republicans caving on the megabill reflects Trump’s growing control over the GOP](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-caving-megabill-reflects-trumps-growing-control-gop-rcna216788)

*It’s not enough to say, “[Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) always cave,” because before [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) took dominion over the party, [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) [lawmakers](https://www.congress.gov/) weren’t quite this embarrassing.*

July 3, 2025, 2:48 PM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

Immediately after [Senate Republicans](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/senate-republicans-advance-far-right-megabill-can-pass-house-rcna216257) advanced their party’s domestic policy megabill — the inaptly named [One Big Beautiful Bill Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text) — attention quickly shifted to the House, where the far-right legislation faced an uncertain future.

In theory, there was a real chance that the bill would be, at a minimum, changed upon its arrival in the lower chamber. After all, quite a few [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) declared, publicly and in no uncertain terms, that they considered the [Senate version](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/senate-republicans-megabill-even-brutal-houses-version-cbo-says-rcna215900) completely unacceptable. If just four of them stuck to their guns, GOP leaders would have to regroup and work out a new solution.

But in practice, those intraparty critics did exactly what most observers expected them to do: One by one, [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) caved. [The New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/02/us/politics/trump-bill-holdout-republicans.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&) on part of the process that led so many GOP members to collapse under pressure:

> *A conga line of angsty [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [lawmakers](https://www.congress.gov/) filed through the [West Wing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) on Wednesday, hemming and hawing about the [big domestic policy bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text) that [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wants them to pass by Friday. They walked out with [signed merchandise](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), photos in the [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and, by some accounts, a newfound appreciation for the bill — targets all of a blunt-force charm offensive waged with precision by the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).*

“The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) was wonderful, as always,” [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Tim Burchett (T-TN2)](https://burchett.house.gov/) said in a video he released documenting his [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) visit. “Informative, funny, he told me he likes seeing me on TV, which was kind of cool.” In the same clip, [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Byron Donalds (T-FL)](https://donalds.house.gov/) asks [Burchett](https://burchett.house.gov/), “Did you show them what he signed for you?” The [Tennessean](https://burchett.house.gov/) replied, “Yeah, he signed a bunch of stuff. ... It’s cool.”

Well, it was something, though “cool” isn’t the first adjective to come to mind.

Part of the problem, of course, is that many [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) [lawmakers](https://www.congress.gov/), who claimed to have principled objections to the package, took direction from a [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [doesn’t appear to know much](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/gops-hawley-says-trump-was-unaware-key-element-republican-megabill-rcna213751) about the legislation he’s desperate to sign. As recently as Wednesday, the day before the final vote, [NOTUS reported](https://www.notus.org/congress/reconciliation-timeline-slipping-trump): “[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) still doesn’t seem to have a firm grasp about what his signature legislative achievement does.”

Another part of the problem is that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), despite his ignorance, was able to sway skeptical members with smoke and mirrors. When he wasn’t scoring cheap points with autographed merchandise, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was offering [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) [assurances about executive orders](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3lt2ovznwun24) that might exist — someday, in some form, with some contents that’ll be worked out later, which might overcome legal challenges.

But stepping back, it’s equally important to appreciate the degree to which [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) [lawmakers](https://www.congress.gov/) have devolved of late. In the aftermath of the [Capitol Hill](https://www.congress.gov/) vote, a great many observers repeated an understandable complaint: “[Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) always cave under pressure.”

That’s not, however, entirely true. In fact, in recent years, many of these same [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) members didn’t cave, much to the chagrin of [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Speaker](https://www.speaker.gov/) [Mike Johnson (T-LA4)](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/), his predecessors and his fellow party leaders.

Around this time a year ago, [we talked about](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/speaker-johnson-fails-republicans-confront-pure-chaos-rcna147334) the incredible dysfunction among [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/), who [struggled mightily](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/mike-johnsons-hapless-speakership-reaches-new-embarrassing-low-rcna138955) to complete basic tasks in the last [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/), slowing legislative progress to a pace [unseen in nearly a century](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/least-productive-congress-since-great-depression_n_65553d38e4b0e4767012b6df). A [Punchbowl News](https://punchbowl.news/) [report](https://punchbowl.news/article/johnson-leadership-tough-week-house-gop/) concluded at the time, “This is the most chaotic, inefficient and ineffective majority we’ve seen in decades covering Congress.”

The chaos was the direct result of [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) [members](https://www.congress.gov/) sticking to their guns and shrugging off the demands of party leaders.

It routinely created dynamics in which [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) had to sheepishly turn to the [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [minority](https://www.congress.gov/,), hat in hand, to secure the votes necessary to advance must-pass legislation, precisely because so many rank-and-file [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) [members](https://www.congress.gov/) didn’t back down under party pressure.

The pitiful [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) conference that Americans are watching in 2025, in other words, is a relatively new phenomenon — and a reminder that the contemporary [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) is less of a political party and more of an embarrassing personality cult.

“A functioning [House](https://www.house.gov/) leadership team would work the members, make changes as necessary and bring this bill to the floor once they knew they could pass it,” [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Sean Casten (D-IL)](https://casten.house.gov/) [wrote online](https://x.com/SeanCasten/status/1940510796238532865) in the midst of a multi-hour delay on Wednesday. “But [Mike Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) is not a leader. He does what Daddy says, and Daddy said pass it before July 4.”

The day before the final vote in the [House](https://www.house.gov/), [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Derrick Van Orden (T-WI3)](https://vanorden.house.gov/), acknowledging the partisan impressions, [told reporters](https://newrepublic.com/post/197561/maga-republican-rep-van-orden-not-trump-little-bitches), “The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) of the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) didn’t give us an assignment. We’re not a bunch of little bitches[^11] around here, OK? I’m a [member](https://www.house.gov/) of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/). I represent almost 800,000 [Wisconsinites](https://www.wisconsin.gov/Pages/home.aspx).”

[^11]: @RalphHightower: Yes you are, little bitches. 

A day later, [Van Orden](https://vanorden.house.gov/) voted for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s radical bill, at [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s behest, ahead of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s arbitrary and unnecessary deadline.
