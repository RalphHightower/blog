## [Trump firing Fed Chair Jerome Powell won’t get him what he wants](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-firing-jerome-powell-fed-chair-interest-rates-rcna219333)

*The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has only himself to blame for interest rates being where they are.*

July 17, 2025, 12:50 PM EDT
By Jared Bernstein, former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers

[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), who made a television career out of saying “You’re fired!” to people, wants to say those words to [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) [Chair Jerome Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm). On Wednesday, [White](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) officials told media outlets that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) would [likely fire Powell “soon,”](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/16/trump-powell-fed-fire.html) only for [the president to back off later in the day](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/watch/trump-firing-fed-chair-powell-is-highly-unlikely-243342405803) after the stock market started to nose-dive. I’ve written before why that’s a terrible idea: It undermines the independence of the central bank, and history is brimming with examples of that invariably turning out badly. And there’s another factor for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to consider: Just firing [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) won’t get him what he wants.

The reason for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s anger comes down to different goals. The Fed’s goal is to engage in the balancing act of maximizing employment at stable, low inflation. The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has two goals. One, he wants to preside over a hotter economy and believes that if [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) and the Fed would lower the interest rate they control as their key tool of monetary policy, that will get him there. Two, he and the [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) just blew out the deficit, and lower rates would make servicing the growing debt burden easier.

> *Unless there’s a big economic shock, the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) neither slams the brake nor pounds the accelerator.*

The problem is that central banks that must follow their [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)s’ orders tend to floor the accelerator until the engine overheats and the car shuts down. Independent central banks, conversely, speed up and slow down as needed to keep the car running.

What, specifically, is [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) doing that’s making [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) so unhappy? After all, though [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said Wednesday that[“I was surprised he was appointed,”](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-says-was-surprised-jerome-powell-fed-chair-appointed-was-appoint-rcna219162) it was [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) himself who appointed him [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) then extended [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm)’s appointment).

The answer is clear: [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) won’t lower the interest rate fast or far enough. And you can be sure neither he nor anyone else on the [Fed board](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/default.htm) will lower it anywhere close to the 3 percentage-point cut [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has most recently called for, a move that would bring the rate from about 4.3% to 1.3%.

These days, unless there’s a big economic shock, the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) neither slams the brake nor pounds the accelerator. Instead, they lower rates by a quarter point at a time. From their public guidance, it sounds like they might do so, but not until their meeting in mid-September.

Only replacing [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) wouldn’t be enough to change that course. [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) is just one vote of 12 on the [Federal Open Market Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) that votes every six weeks or so on whether to raise, lower or hold rates. The majority of the [FOMC](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) would not vote to suddenly cut rates at the level [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) demands. Of course, it’s always possible that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) could just fire more FOMC members, but such a move would only destabilize the markets further.

Economically, the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/)’s current policy is highly defensible. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s right that the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/)’s interest rate is high relative to where it was in his first term, and low rates (along with stimulus spending) were especially essential during the pandemic-induced recession. But, as [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) has pointed out in public statements, given where the economy is right now, holding the rate around 4% makes sense. There’s a lot of uncertainty about where both inflation and growth are headed, all of which, for the record, stems not from the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) but from the [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). Trade wars that weaponize sweeping tariffs push inflation up and growth down. This is a challenge for the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) because it implies contradictory needs to hit the brake (to offset higher inflation) and the accelerator (to offset slower growth).

> *This [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) creates its own reality. The [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/), however, must live and work in the actual reality.*

So, their best play is to stay in wait-and-see mode until they have a clearer take on where the tariffs land, how much they raise prices and what effects they have on growth. Under these conditions, it would be malpractice to lower rates by 3 percentage points. It would be like driving into a fog and accelerating from 30 to 90 mph: reckless, foolish and sure to cause an accident. And because it would push inflation up, it would lead investors to demand an “inflation premium,” i.e., a higher interest rate in exchange for their [loans](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/17/business/trump-powell-federal-reserve-higher-rates.html), i.e., the opposite of what Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is looking for.

Now, consider this bit of irony: If there was no trade war, the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) would have already lowered interest rates. If [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wants the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) to lower the interest rate, end the trade war. Or at least stop negotiating, pushing back dates, and settle and stick to a set of tariff rates. He doesn’t need [Congress](https://www.whitehouse.gov/); he doesn’t need to fire [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm). He can do that himself.

But the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) almost certainly doesn’t make this connection, because neither he nor his team seems to understand how these parts fit together. They don’t believe the tariffs have any impact on inflation, despite the fact that we saw those effects earlier this week in the release of [the latest consumer price index](https://www.msnbc.com/ana-cabrera-reports/watch/new-report-shows-inflation-accelerated-in-june-signals-impacts-of-trump-tariffs-243252805542). They see no inflationary risk to sharply lowering rates, and no damage to the economy’s future by compromising Fed independence.

That’s another way to understand this problem. This administration creates its own reality. The Fed, however, must live and work in the actual reality.

So, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) continues to harangue [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) and threaten to replace him with someone who will do what he tells him to do. He’s clearly champing at the bit to revert to his “You’re fired” schtick and take control of interest rates. I hope I’m wrong, but from what I’ve seen of this [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), I fear he won’t be able to resist much longer.
