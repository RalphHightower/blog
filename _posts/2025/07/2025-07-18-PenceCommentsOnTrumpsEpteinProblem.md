## [With new comments on Epstein files, Mike Pence says what Trump didn’t want to hear](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/new-comments-epstein-files-mike-pence-says-trump-didnt-want-hear-rcna219588)

*In an unprecedented dynamic, one of the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s key intraparty detractors is the [former vice president](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/people/mike-pence/) who served at his side for four years.*

July 18, 2025, 11:27 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

To hear [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) tell it, Republicans who take the Jeffrey Epstein scandal seriously, and resist [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) pressure to treat the controversy as a “hoax,” are “[stupid](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-lashes-backers-epstein-debacle-dont-want-support-anymore-rcna219125),” “[foolish](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-lashes-backers-epstein-debacle-dont-want-support-anymore-rcna219125)” and “[naïve](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-jeffrey-epstein-ghislaine-maxwell-maga-live-updates-2099602#live-blog-60622).” Evidently, the president’s [former vice president](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/people/mike-pence/) came to a different conclusion. [HuffPost reported](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mike-pence-wants-epstein-files-release_n_6878f767e4b0b08368f50f34):

> *[Former Vice President Mike Pence](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/people/mike-pence/) has joined calls for the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) to release all files related to the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking investigation, saying anyone associated with the late sex offender ‘ought to be held up to public scrutiny.’ ‘I think the time has come for the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) to release all of the files regarding Jeffrey Epstein’s investigation and prosecution,’ [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [former VP](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/people/mike-pence/) said in an interview Wednesday with [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/)’ Major Garrett.*

While the Indiana Republican insisted that victims’ names should obviously be redacted, [Pence](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/people/mike-pence/) added, in reference to the late alleged sex trafficker, “I think that anyone who participated or was associated with this despicable man ought to be held up to public scrutiny. ... I just think that we ought to get the facts to the American people.”

And while it’s probably fair to say that the [former vice president](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/people/mike-pence/)’s influence in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is minimal, his comments stood out, in part because [Pence](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/people/mike-pence/) was saying what [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) didn’t want to hear, and in part because this wasn’t an isolated incident.

In May, for example, the [former vice president](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/people/mike-pence/) [criticized Trump’s trade tariffs](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-[administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)/mike-pence-criticizes-trump-tariffs-key-foreign-policy-issues-watches-rcna206755) during an appearance on [NBC](https://www.nbcnews.com/)’s [“Meet the Press.”](https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press-full-episodes)

In the same interview, [Pence](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/people/mike-pence/) took issue with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s criticisms of U.S. foreign policy during the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s recent trip to [Saudi Arabia](https://my.gov.sa/). “I’ve never been a fan of American [presidents](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) criticizing America on foreign soil,” [Pence said](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/18/pence-trump-foreign-policy-00356074). “And to have the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) in [Saudi Arabia](https://my.gov.sa/) questioning America’s global war on terror, and describing it as nation-building and interventionist, I thought was a disservice to generations of Americans who wore the uniform and who took the fight to our enemy, you know, in [Afghanistan](https://moi.gov.af/) and in [Iraq](http://mop.gov.iq/).”

“And particularly giving that speech in [Saudi Arabia](https://my.gov.sa/), where 15 of the 19 9/11 hijackers hailed from, not including Osama bin Laden, I thought was unfortunate,” he continued.

Two months earlier, after [Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/) [Secretary Scott Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) publicly chided Americans’ interest in affordable consumer goods, [Pence criticized him](https://thehill.com/homenews/5183177-pence-bessent-american-dream-cheap-goods-tariffs/), too.

The month before that, the [former vice president](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/people/mike-pence/) [took issue with](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/pence-positions-one-trumps-last-remaining-republican-critics-rcna192961) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s bizarre effort to blame [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/) for [Russia](http://government.ru/)’s 2022 invasion, which came on the heels of separate Pence comments in which he [raised concerns](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/pence-positions-one-trumps-last-remaining-republican-critics-rcna192961) about the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) abandoning our [Ukrainian](https://www.gov.ua/) allies.


All of this, of course, came on the heels of a 2024 campaign season in which [Pence](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/people/mike-pence/) — whose life [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) put in danger on Jan. 6, 2021 — [refused to back](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/finish-line-trumps-former-president-still-isnt-backing-rcna178459) his party’s presidential ticket, [urged](https://www.semafor.com/article/09/26/2024/mike-pence-quietly-lays-the-groundwork-for-a-post-trump-future) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) to reject the “protectionist tariffs” that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is so fond of, and told a group of voters in [New York](https://www.ny.gov/): “I have real concerns about the direction of the [Republican Party](https://www.gop.com/) today.”

It’s not exactly a secret that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has achieved a dominant level of power and control over the contemporary [GOP](https://www.gop.com/), but he still faces some pockets of partisan resistance. In a dynamic without precedent in the American tradition, one of the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s most notable intraparty detractors is the vice [president](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/people/mike-pence/) who served at his side for four years.
