## [Seeking transparency on the Epstein files, Senate Democrats invoke the ‘rule of five’](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-epstein-files-schumer-senate-democrats-rule-five-rcna221954)

*[Chuck Schumer](https://www.schumer.senate.gov/) came up with a new way to force the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) to release the Jeffrey Epstein files, but will the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) comply?*

July 30, 2025, 11:28 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

[Congressional](https://www.congress.gov/) [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org//) have been focusing quite a bit on [Donald Trump and the Jeffrey Epstein scandal](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-jolts-epstein-scandal-new-comments-virginia-giuffre-mar-lago-spa-rcna221827) scandal in recent weeks, though party leaders and officials are still coming up with new angles to the controversy. In fact, this week, [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Minority Leader](https://bioguide.congress.gov/search/bio/S000148) [Chuck Schumer](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/chuck-schumer-republican-party-future-trump-rcna197092) highlighted a national security element that I hadn’t heard before.

“Whatever may be in the Epstein files is clearly troubling enough that [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) doesn’t want to touch this issue with a 10-foot pole,” the [New York DemocratSchumer](https://www.schumer.senate.gov/) said. “So it’s natural to ask: What happens if America’s adversaries use cyberattacks or other means to access investigative materials into Jeffrey Epstein that are embarrassing — or worse — for [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and the people around him? What happens if Epstein materials end up in the hands of the Chinese government, or Russia, or North Korea?”

[Schumer](https://www.schumer.senate.gov/), while calling on the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) to immediately conduct a counterintelligence threat assessment, concluded: “Unless the Epstein files are released, and made fully transparent to the public, could our adversaries use that information to blackmail someone like the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)? Or other senior leaders in government? What kind of risk could that pose to our national security?”

This was a fresh approach to an existing story, though it’s likely the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) won’t be overly eager to respond to the senator’s appeal. That said, as [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-[administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)/live-blog/trump-bove-hegseth-epstein-maxwell-giuffre-immigration-live-updates-rcna221293#rcrd85665), the [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) leader also had a related idea that’s intended to force the issue.

> *[Senate](https://www.senate.gov) [Minority Leader](https://www.senate.gov/about/parties-leadership/majority-minority-leaders.htm) [Chuck Schumer (D-NY)](https://www.schumer.senate.gov/), is leading all seven senators on the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee](http://www.hsgac.senate.gov/) in invoking a rarely used law to request files in the Jeffrey Epstein case and have them delivered to the committee next month. In a letter sent to [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/), the group says it is requesting the files under the law, which says an ‘Executive agency, on request of ... the [Committee on \[Homeland Security and\] Governmental Affairs](http://www.hsgac.senate.gov/) of the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/), or any five members thereof, shall submit any information requested of it relating to any matter within the jurisdiction of the committee.’*

As Capitol Hill watchers know, members of the minority party have very limited power and cannot issue subpoenas. But as [The New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/30/us/politics/democrats-trump-epstein-files.html), there is a rather obscure policy known as the [“rule of five”](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title5-section2954&num=0&edition=prelim) that says federal agencies are required to provide relevant information if any five members of the [Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee](http://www.hsgac.senate.gov/) request it.

“That provision — which became law in 1928 and sets a seven-member rule for the [House](https://www.house.gov/)’s [oversight committee]([Committee on Oversight and Government Reform](https://oversight.house.gov/)) — effectively offers a way for members of the minority party to compel information from the executive branch because they cannot issue congressional subpoenas,” the [Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) report added. “But it has been infrequently used, and it has not faced significant tests in court, raising questions over whether it can be enforced.”

[NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/) similarly added, “It’s not clear what enforcement mechanism Democrats would use if the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) refuses to comply.”

In other words, [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) appear to be properly applying the law in order to force transparency on the Epstein files, but if the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) ignores the effort — which appears quite likely — it’s not altogether clear what recourse would be available.

It’s not as if they could refer the matter to the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) for further review.

Nevertheless, [the Senate Democrats’ letter concluded:](https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/d1193ded99f0a9a9/ced71823-full.pdf): “Please provide these documents and information as soon as possible, but no later than August 15, 2025. Additionally, please arrange to provide a briefing to Committee staff as soon as possible, but no later than August 29, 2025.”
