## [Trump‚Äôs Texas flood response reflects glaringly different approach to aid for GOP-led states](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/texas-flooding-trump-response-republican-states-fema-rcna217259)

*The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) quickly committed vital funding for [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)-led [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) after last week's deadly flooding. But [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/)-led states haven‚Äôt always received the same treatment.*

July 7, 2025, 3:40 PM EDT
By [Ja'han Jones](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jahan-jones-ncpn371241)

The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)‚Äôs [politicization of federal disaster aid](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/fema-north-carolina-washington-recovery-funds-rcna201417) was on display over the weekend.

[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-racism-bigotry-ogles-zohran-mamdani-maga-rcna215644)‚Äôs provision of disaster aid to help [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) respond to [deadly flooding in Kerr County](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/live-blog/texas-floods-live-updates-search-for-survivors-rcna217165) ‚Äî the conservative-leaning region that helped elect [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Chip Roy](https://roy.house.gov/) ‚Äî was appropriately urgent. His approach to recent catastrophes in states led by [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/)? Not so much.

The [federal government](https://www.usa.gov/) should urgently provide all aid necessary to stricken areas. So there was nothing wrong with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs announcement that he had authorized a ‚Äúmajor disaster declaration‚Äù that will unlock federal funding for Texas.

[Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/) [Secretary Kristi Noem](https://www.dhs.gov/person/kristi-noem) shared the announcement in a social media post, vowing that [Texans](https://www.texas.gov/) will ‚Äúget the support they need as search efforts continue and recovery begins.‚Äù

But [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) have taken a [markedly different approach](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/fema-north-carolina-washington-recovery-funds-rcna201417) to [federal assistance](https://www.fema.gov/) for various [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/)-led states ‚Äî slashing, stalling or outright denying money for disaster aid, sometimes for nakedly political purposes.

In fact, just hours before [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) aid announcement, the advisor he tapped to lead the [U.S. government‚Äôs response](https://www.fema.gov/) to deadly wildfires in [Los Angeles County](https://lacounty.gov/) earlier this year, [Ric Grenell](https://x.com/RichardGrenell/), posted a political attack on [California](https://www.ca.gov/) [Gov.](https://www.gov.ca.gov/) [Gavin Newsom](https://www.gov.ca.gov/about/), a [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/). Grenell said he had told [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) not to give aid to [California](https://www.ca.gov/) unless the state meets certain political demands related to its water supply and forestation policies ‚Äî essentially peddling [Trump‚Äôs false claims that the devastating fires stemmed from liberal policymaking](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/09/politics/fact-check-trump-california-wildfires-fema).

‚ÄúThe fires will happen again. I‚Äôve told [DJT](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) we shouldn‚Äôt spend federal money on [California](https://www.ca.gov/) if the problems aren‚Äôt fixed first,‚Äù [Grenell](https://x.com/RichardGrenell/) [wrote on X](https://x.com/RichardGrenell/status/1941844216629354535?) on Sunday morning.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) himself has said that [California](https://www.ca.gov/) instituting a restrictive voter identification law is a [‚Äúcondition‚Äù for him to administer more money](https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-wants-california-institute-restrictive-voter-id-law-receiving-wi-rcna189458), so he clearly doesn‚Äôt think politicization of disaster aid is a problem ‚Äî despite his [lie-filled allegations about President Joe Biden‚Äôs administration after Hurricane Helene last fall](https://www.vox.com/politics/376982/trump-hurricane-helene-fema-lies-debunked).

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) also has [denied a request from another Democrat](https://washingtonstatestandard.com/briefs/for-a-second-time-fema-rejects-wa-request-for-bomb-cyclone-disaster-aid/), [Washington]() state [Gov.]() [Bob Ferguson](), to issue a major disaster declaration that would unlock funds to help his state recover from a bomb cyclone in November. The [Federal Emergency Management Agency](https://www.ca.gov/) concluded that such a declaration is [‚Äúnot warranted.‚Äù](https://www.murray.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WA-ATD-Letter.pdf)

And the administration has [denied North Carolina Democratic Gov. Josh Stein‚Äôs request](https://governor.nc.gov/news/press-releases/2025/05/23/statement-governor-josh-stein-femas-denial-north-carolinas-reimbursement-request) to get fully reimbursed for Helene cleanup, a move that could severely undermine the state‚Äôs years-long recovery efforts. [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/) similarly determined that the request is ‚Äúnot warranted.‚Äù

The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has been outspoken about his goal of [shutting down FEMA by the end of hurricane season](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-says-fema-wound-hurricane-season-rcna212307) and giving states a greater share of the financial burden of disaster recovery. In the meantime, the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) seems to be using the [agency](https://www.ca.gov/) as a means to assist people and places seen as friendly to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) ‚Äî and to punish those that aren‚Äôt.
