title: "Department of Justice Is Investigating Trump’s Perceived Enemies: Former FBI James Comey, Former CIA John Brennan"

## [DOJ says Comey and Brennan, perceived Trump foes, are under criminal investigation](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/doj-says-comey-brennan-perceived-trump-foes-are-criminal-investigation-rcna217731)

*When it comes to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)'s perceived enemies facing investigations, the former [CIA](https://www.cia.gov/) director and former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director have plenty of company.*

July 9, 2025, 11:21 AM EDT / Updated July 9, 2025, 11:40 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

[Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) raised a few eyebrows Tuesday night with [an unexpected report](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/john-brennan-james-comey-under-criminal-investigation-doj-sources): Former [CIA](https://www.cia.gov/) Director John Brennan and former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) Director James Comey, the network said, are facing criminal investigations from [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/). Another conservative media outlet, [The Washington Times](https://www.washingtontimes.com/), published [a similar report](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/jul/8/fbi-launches-criminal-investigations-brennan-comey-trump-russia-probe/) soon after.

Asked about the reporting, [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) press secretary Karoline Leavitt didn’t confirm the investigations, but the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s chief spokesperson cheered the news during a [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) appearance, calling Comey and Brennan “disgraceful individuals” who “lied to Congress.” Leavitt said she's "glad to hear it," referencing the reporting on the probes, and added that “the truth must come out. ... That’s what the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) believes in.”

And while those comments were difficult to take seriously, given [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s record of breathtaking dishonesty, the underlying issue is apparently quite real. [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/trump-administration-targets-comey-brennan-new-investigation-rcna217713):

The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has put two repeated targets of [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) under criminal investigation, although details of what exactly they are being investigated for or how far the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) intends on taking the probes are unclear. [Brennan and Comey] are facing criminal investigations, according to a statement that a [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) spokesperson provided to reporters.

Comey did not respond to a request for comment. Brennan, who is a paid contributor to [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) and [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/), had no immediate comment. The [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) declined to comment.

Time will tell what, if anything, comes of these investigations, and it’s worth emphasizing that criminal probes often don’t lead to criminal charges.

But let’s not miss the forest for the trees: Brennan and Comey have long been targets, not just of the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s far-right base — both men appeared, for example, on [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Director Kash Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s [so-called enemies list](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/dem/releases/radical-extremists-kash-patel-would-weaponize-the-fbi-to-target-enemies-of-trump-not-enemies-of-america), filled with those he identified as “government gangsters” — but also of the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) himself.

What’s more, they join a long and growing list.

In April, for example, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) signed two [first-of-their-kind executive orders](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/authoritarian-fashion-trump-orders-probes-two-ex-officials-defied-rcna200574) targeting a pair of officials from his [first term](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/) who defied him. There was barely a pretense in the orders that the targeted former officials — Christopher Krebs, who led the [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency](https://www.cisa.gov/), and Miles Taylor, a former high-ranking [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/) official — had done anything wrong. Indeed, the closer one looked at the stated rationales in support of the directives, [the more ridiculous they appeared](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/04/10/trump-krebs-election-denialism/).

Nevertheless, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) directed [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) and the [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/) to launch a “review” into Krebs, while simultaneously ordering [DHS](https://www.dhs.gov/) to investigate Taylor.

Weeks later, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) broke new ground again, directing the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) to launch [a wide-ranging investigation into Joe Biden](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-targets-biden-new-investigation-republican-endgame-comes-focus-rcna211131) and officials in the [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)’s [administration](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/), based on [Republican](https://www.dhs.gov/) conspiracy theories about the [former president](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/)’s mental health. It was an unprecedented move: An [incumbent American president](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) had never before publicly ordered a federal probe of his predecessor.

There was a degree of irony to the circumstances. After his defeat in the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) spent years insisting that [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) had ordered an investigation into him — an odd conspiracy theory for which there is literally no evidence — but [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) then [did exactly what he falsely accused](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-targets-biden-new-investigation-republican-endgame-comes-focus-rcna211131).

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) also [endorsed California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s arrest](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-endorses-arrest-newsom-sees-unmistakable-step-authoritarianism-rcna211894), before demanding that [CNN face criminal prosecution](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/bizarre-reason-trump-team-say-may-try-prosecute-cnn-rcna216447) for running reports the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) didn’t like.

And did I mention that, over the last several weeks, a [Democratic mayor](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/newark-mayor-ras-baraka-sues-alina-habba-ice-arrest-rcna210629), a [Democratic U.S. House member](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/rep-lamonica-mciver-arrested-ice-new-jersey-alina-habba-rcna207334), the [staffer](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/31/nyregion/nadler-aide-handcuffed-federal-agents.html) of a different [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) U.S. [House](https://www.house.gov/) member, a [sitting judge](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/fbi-arrests-judge-wisconsin-ag-pam-bondi-directs-new-threats-judiciary-rcna203061) and [a labor leader](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/live-blog/la-unrest-live-updates-crowds-protesting-immigration-raids-rcna211757/rcrd81284?canonicalCard=true) have all been criminally charged, detained or taken into custody by [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) administration officials? Because that happened, too.

There are also ongoing [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) investigations into [Media Matters](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-admin-regulators-launch-investigation-media-matters-adding-patte-rcna208780), [ActBlue](https://newrepublic.com/post/194450/donald-trump-attack-actblue-donations), former [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) [Gov.](https://www.governor.ny.gov/) [Andrew Cuomo](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/cuomo-investigation-trump-justice-department-doj-rcna208209), [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) [Attorney General](https://ag.ny.gov/) [Letitia James](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-doj-prosecute-new-york-ag-letitia-james-rcna201554) and [New Jersey](https://www.nj.gov/) [Gov.](https://www.nj.gov/governor/) [Phil Murphy](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/alina-habba-new-jersey-phil-murphy-matthew-platkin-immigration-rcna200902).

[Axios recently reported](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/21/trump-retaliation-revenge-biden-security-clearance), “In the final days of the [2024 campaign](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/2024presgeresults.pdf), [Axios](https://www.axios.com/) [identified a list of perceived adversaries](https://www.axios.com/2024/11/01/trumps-enemies-within-list) who fit what [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) ominously described as ‘the enemies from within.’ As [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), he has taken steps to retaliate against virtually all of them.”

That was four months ago. The problem is vastly worse now, and there’s no reason to believe conditions will improve anytime soon.
