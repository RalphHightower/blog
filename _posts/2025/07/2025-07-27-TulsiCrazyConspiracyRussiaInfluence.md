*[Gabbard](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) is scrambling to find red meat for the base.*

As [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) tries to quiet a rebellion from his own base over his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s [decision to withhold the release of the complete Jeffrey Epstein files](https://www.msnbc.com/the-briefing-with-jen-psaki/watch/reports-say-doj-told-trump-you-re-in-the-epstein-files-243745349787), his [director of national intelligence](https://www.odni.gov/), [Tulsi Gabbard](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence), [is going on offense](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/gabbards-unprecedented-claim-president-led-treasonous-conspiracy-rcna217151?cid=eml_mrd_20250724).

Through memos and documents released both last week and this week, [Gabbard](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) is attempting to advance the evidence-free claim that officials in [former President Barack Obama’s administration](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/dni-gabbard-concocts-odd-treasonous-conspiracy-theory-eyes-russia-prob-rcna219985) engaged in a “treasonous conspiracy” and “coup” attempt in 2016. [Gabbard](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) alleges the [Obama administration](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) manipulated intelligence assessments that found that [Russia](http://government.ru/) sought to tip the election in favor of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), with the purported goal of destroying [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) politically. [Gabbard](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) has recommended criminal charges, [including against Obama himself, while pushing this nonsensical narrative](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/24/justice-department-obama-2016-election), while pushing this nonsensical narrative.

> *The sloppiness of what [Gabbard](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) is presenting only confirms what has been widely suspected about her actions: that it’s a weapon of distraction.*

While the reports bring a bit of new information to light about U.S. intelligence operations, they don’t dislodge the many well-substantiated assessments indicating [Russia](http://government.ru/) intervened in 2016 to hurt Hillary Clinton and boost [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). The timing of the release does suggest, however, that [Gabbard](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) is scrambling to find some way to satisfy people in the MAGA base hungry for a new conspiracy theory as the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) tries to leave the Epstein story behind.

[Gabbard](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence)’s maneuvering appears to be an attempt to put meat on the bones of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s longtime narrative that all the investigations showing [Russia](http://government.ru/) tried to help [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) win the 2016 election were a “hoax.” On Friday, she released a memo, emails and intelligence documents that she effectively claimed were proof that [Russia](http://government.ru/) didn’t try to interfere in the 2016 election. But [as CNN points out](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/22/politics/tulsi-gabbard-russia-trump-obama-analysis), her main argument rested on a sleight of hand:

She cited an intelligence document that purportedly said [Russia](http://government.ru/) ‘did not attempt to affect the outcome of the election.’ In fact, that document — a [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s Daily Brief, or his daily intelligence report — merely said [Russia](http://government.ru/) hadn’t impacted the election results ‘by conducting malicious cyber activities against election infrastructure.’ “It was referring narrowly to a very specific (and severe) type of potential election interference. The [Obama administration](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) never alleged such interference took place or that [Russia](http://government.ru/) manipulated actual votes that were cast.”

In other words, [Gabbard](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) used a cherry-picked quote to conflate the idea that [Russia](http://government.ru/) didn’t actually target election infrastructure and attempt to alter vote counts with the idea that Russia didn’t interfere at all.

On Wednesday, [Gabbard](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) announced a new document release, which included a declassified report put together by [Republicans](https//www.gop.com/) on the [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Intelligence Committee](https://intelligence.house.gov/) in 2020 about the 2017 intelligence community assessment of [Russian](http://government.ru/) interference. As [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/) reports, “The [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) report was emphatically rejected at the time by [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) lawmakers on the panel who played no role in its creation.”

[NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/) explains that the report found that even the deeply partisan [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) report found most of the 2017 intelligence community assessment on [Russian](http://government.ru/) interference in the election “sound,” but it took issue with the reliability of the sources it depended on to come to the conclusion that [Russian](http://government.ru/) [President Vladimir Putin](http://kremlin.ru/) “aspired” to help [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). That’s fine to document for the historical record, but it’s hardly some kind of smoking gun of a conspiracy.

And [Gabbard](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) conveniently skips over the fact that an incredibly rigorous bipartisan Senate investigation released the same year landed somewhere different. As [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/) summarizes it:

> *The 2020 Senate investigation, which spanned three years, involved more than 200 witnesses and reviewed more than a million documents, endorsed the intelligence agencies’ assessment that Russia had spread disinformation online and leaked stolen emails from the [Democratic National Committee](https://www.democrats.org/) to undermine Clinton’s candidacy and bolster [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s prospects. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s current [secretary of](https://www.state.gov/biographies/marco-rubio/) [state](https://www.state.gov/), [Marco Rubio](https://www.state.gov/biographies/marco-rubio/), was the acting chair of the [Intelligence Committee](http://www.intelligence.senate.gov/) at the time. He and every other member of the committee, both [Republicans](https//www.gop.com/) and [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/), endorsed the report’s findings.”*

The [Obama administration](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) and intelligence community’s approach to the matter was [also covered extensively](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/22/gabbard-trump-obama-fact-checker/) through a [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/  ) report in 2019, special counsel Robert Mueller’s report in 2019 and a report by special counsel John Durham in 2023. If there was some grand conspiracy by Obama officials to mess with the intelligence assessment and destroy [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), both [Republicans](https//www.gop.com/) and [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) [had plenty of opportunity to find it](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/gabbards-claims-anti-trump-conspiracy-supported-declassified-documents-124023434).

The sloppiness of what [Gabbard](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) is presenting only confirms what has been widely suspected about her actions: that it’s a weapon of distraction. And it doesn’t seem like a coincidence that she claims to have uncovered evidence of a shadowy “conspiracy” at the exact moment that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is being accused by both [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) and [Republicans](https//www.gop.com/) of covering one up. It all looks like an attempt to find some red meat for the base. [Faux News](https://www foxnews.com/) [appears to be taking the bait](https://x.com/mmfa/status/1948114089860878441), pushing the unsubstantiated [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov=) conspiracy theory on its shows at a far greater rate than the Epstein story. The appetite of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s base, however, is less predictable on this story.

At the same time, [Gabbard](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence)’s new anti-[Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) offensive also functions as an opportunity for her to move to the center of things in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), particularly after she [clashed with Trump](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/17/gabbard-trump-00411685). As my colleague [Steve Benen noted](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/dni-gabbard-concocts-odd-treasonous-conspiracy-theory-eyes-russia-prob-rcna219985), “If the [DNI](https://www.odni.gov/) were looking for a way to return to the president’s good graces, she apparently found one.”

What better way to excite her boss than with a brand-new conspiracy theory?
