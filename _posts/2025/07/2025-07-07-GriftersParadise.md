title: "Grifters Paradise"
---


🎶 As I stroll through the shadow of my [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) land,<br />
I take a look at my deals and my [meme coin](https://gettrumpmemes.com/)’s got no demand.<br />
Been spending most my life living in a Grifter’s Paradise—<br />
Tariffs on my nachos, while I dodge the legal device. 🎶<br />
<br />
🎶 Got a TACO plan, you know it's wild and spicy,<br />
[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) Always Chickens Out—yeah, not exactly dicey.<br />
From steaks to university, casinos that went bust,<br />
My ventures sparkle briefly... 'til they crumble into dust. 🎶<br />
<br />
🎶 Power moves and mugshot memes,<br />
[$TRUMP coin](https://gettrumpmemes.com/) climbing high on libertarian dreams.<br />
Wall Street’s trembling, but I’m just tweeting fast,<br />
Bankruptcy’s a badge now—call it presidential class. 🎶<br />
