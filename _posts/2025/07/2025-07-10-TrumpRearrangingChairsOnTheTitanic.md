Jen Psaki is calling out [Donald Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/donald-trump) over the shocking vanity of comments he made during a [Cabinet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/) meeting Tuesday.

“Have you ever heard the expression ‘rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic’?” Psaki asked viewers at the top of Tuesday night’s show. “It’s supposed to be an unbelievable exaggeration of someone engaging in a trivial task during a crisis. Today, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) one-upped it.”

Psaki spoke about ongoing rescue efforts in [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) following last weekend’s [devastating and deadly floods](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/devastating-texas-floods-highlight-need-for-coordination-experience-amid-trump-era-service-cuts-242828357581) that set the backdrop to [Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8-LREhtn4).

While [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) did speak briefly about the ongoing [federal response,](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/texas-flooding-trump-response-republican-states-fema-rcna217259), including his plan to visit [All In with Chris Hayes on MSNBC / The Chris Hayes Show](https://www.msnbc.com/all)
[Chris Hayes](https://www.msnbc.com/all-in/chris-hayes-biography-n1157641) on Friday, as Psaki noted, “He also had another pressing matter he felt the need to address in that meeting.”

“He spent almost 15 minutes talking about how he [redecorated the Cabinet room](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/07/08/trump-redecorates-white-house-cabinet-room/84511386007/) of the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/),” Psaki said, before playing several clips of the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) boasting about his interior decorating efforts, including his choice to hang a portrait of Andrew Jackson and to fit the room with new drapes and lamps. The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) also mused about adding gold leaf to the walls.

“Painting the ceilings gold isn’t exactly a pressing issue for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Cabinet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/) right now,” Psaki quipped. “But it does tell you a little bit about where [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s head is at.”
