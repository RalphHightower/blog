## [Mike Johnson perfectly explains the flaws in the GOP’s Ghislaine Maxwell gambit](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/ghislaine-maxwell-mike-johnson-murkowski-epstein-trump-rcna220816)

*[Sen.](https//www.senate.gov/) [Lisa Murkowski](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/) also expressed skepticism over the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/)’s questioning of Maxwell as [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s try to quell backlash to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com%) over the Epstein files.*

July 24, 2025, 2:32 PM EDT
By [Ja'han Jones](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jahan-jones-ncpn371241)

[House](https://www.house.gov/) [Speaker](https://www.speaker.gov/) [Mike Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) explained — with perfect clarity — the obvious pitfalls in [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)-led efforts to [question Ghislaine Maxwell](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/ghislaine-maxwell-blanche-meeting-doj-epstein-trump-rcna220219), the convicted child sex trafficker and [Jeffrey Epstein accomplice](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/jeffrey-epstein-grand-jury-transcripts-florida-rcna220605), as [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his allies try to quell the outcry over his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s handling of the Epstein case.

[Deputy Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Todd Blanche](https://www.linkedin.com/in/toddblanche/), formerly [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s criminal defense attorney, is meeting with Maxwell — [for whom Trump expressed his well wishes in 2020 —](https://x.com/axios/status/1290648181752107008) on Thursday. And a [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Oversight Committee](https://oversight.house.gov/) spokesperson said that the committee, led by [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [James Comer (T-KY1)](https://comer.house.gov/), intends to subpoena Maxwell for a deposition as soon as possible.

Speaking to reporters Wednesday, [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) said he backed [Comer](https://comer.house.gov/)’s plan — but raised what he called an “obvious” caveat:

> *I will note the obvious concern, the caveat, that [Chairman](https://oversight.house.gov/) [Comer](https://comer.house.gov/) and I and everyone has, that — could she be counted on to tell the truth? Is she a credible witness? I mean, this is a person who’s been sentenced to many, many years in prison for terrible, unspeakable, conspiratorial acts, and acts against innocent young people. I mean, can we trust what she’s going to say?*

Even [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/), [a lawyer who tried to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/mike-johnson-january-6-house-speaker-nominee-rcna122081), understands what seemingly every reputable lawyer understands: the obvious incentive for Maxwell to lie.

And [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) isn’t the only [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) to raise this concern. [Sen.](https//www.senate.gov/) [Lisa Murkowski (T-AK)](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/) of [told CNN’s Kaitlin Collins](https://x.com/kaitlancollins/status/1948196361775804664) that it seems [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is trying to “move to other news” when it comes to his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s handling of the Epstein files — and that the tactic isn’t working. When [Collins](https://www.cnn.com/profiles/kaitlan-collins#about) asked the senator whether she thinks Maxwell is credible, [Murkowski](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/) took a long pause before answering.

“I don’t know that I find her credible,” she said.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and some of his allies seem to think that questioning Maxwell will quiet the storm of controversy surrounding the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/), its handling of Epstein-related documents — and [the growing appearance of a cover-up](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/doj-reportedly-told-trump-may-name-epstein-files-rcna220630) designed to shield the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) from potentially damning allegations about his personal ties to Epstein.

[Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) and [Murkowski](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/) just explained the flawed logic in that strategy.
