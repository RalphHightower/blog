## [Trump's favorite lines of defense aren't working in the Epstein controversy](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-epstein-files-conspiracy-controversy-defense-arguments-maga-rcna220009)

*He's skated past previous controversies by changing his arguments.*

July 23, 2025, 6:00 AM EDT
By Ryan Teague Beckwith, Newsletter Editor

An editor once asked me [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s position on an issue I was writing about. "On which day?" I replied.

Since he burst onto the political scene in 2015, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has made claims, dropped them, adopted a new argument that contradicts the old one, casually admitted something he long denied, changed the subject and generally just thrown every possible argument at the wall to see what would stick.

He [spent years](https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-birther-timeline-20160916-snap-htmlstory.html) arguing that [Barack Obama](https://www.democrats.org/) wasn’t born in the United States, [simply admitted that wasn’t true](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/donald-trump-obama-was-born-united-states-n649501) and [falsely blamed Hillary Clinton](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/ap-fact-check-trumps-bogus-birtherism-claim-clinton) for starting the rumor. He swore his 2016 campaign had only [only low-level contacts](https://time.com/5290531/donald-trump-robert-mueller-russia-investigation-arguments/) with [Russia](https://government.ru/); then [admitted his son, son-in-law and campaign head](https://time.com/5290531/donald-trump-robert-mueller-russia-investigation-arguments/) met at [Trump Tower](https://www.trump.com/residential-real-estate-portfolio/trump-tower-new-york) with a [Russian](http://government.ru/) woman claiming to have dirt on Hillary Clinton — and argued that anyone would do the same.

Even his defense attorneys adopted this tactic, arguing during his impeachment trial over the [Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}) that he could be tried instead on [criminal charges](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/09/us/politics/bruce-castor-trump-lawyer.html), then claiming when he faced criminal charges that he had [presidential immunity](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/the-arguments-trumps-attorneys-are-making-to-claim-hes-immune-from-jan-6-prosecution).

It’s all reminiscent of [Bart Simpson](https://www.disneyplus.com/browse/page-e68fa3ee-0f68-402d-9cb8-56883ae4c9dd)’s infamous defense when confronted with a note from school: [“I didn’t do it. Nobody saw me do it. You can’t prove anything.”](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5179010/quotes/)

Faced with controversy over the release of any records related to the late pedophile and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has again tried the same defenses, but they don't seem to be working as well.

By his own admission, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) had a long history with Epstein that included [socializing with him at a Mar-a-Lago party](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/tape-shows-donald-trump-jeffrey-epstein-discussing-women-1992-party-n1030686), [attending a Victoria's Secret party together](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/17/us/politics/timeline-trump-epstein.html) and [flying on his private jet](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article256740662.html). ([Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has denied allegations of sexual misconduct and has denied any impropriety related to Epstein’s crimes.)

But after [spreading a conspiracy theory](https://www.factcheck.org/2019/08/the-epstein-connections-fueling-conspiracy-theories/) related to Epstein's death in 2019, suggesting that his death [may not have been a suicide](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-jeffrey-epstein-years-including-2024-campaign-trail/story?id=123778541) in 2020 and promising in 2024 that he would [declassify the Epstein files](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-pre-election-comments-epstein-files-resurface-edited-fox-news-i-rcna218840) if re-elected, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has found himself in a bit of a pickle. The [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) and [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) released [a memo](https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1407001/dl?inline) on July 7 concluding that there was no evidence of an “incriminating ‘client list,’” but that just fanned the flames.

There’s nothing interesting in the files: [“I don’t understand why the Jeffrey Epstein case would be of interest to anybody. It’s pretty boring stuff.”](https://x.com/Acyn/status/1945254821482914162?)

Epstein is old news: [“Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein? This guy has been talked about for years.”](https://www.tiktok.com/@cnbc/video/7524769230823132471?lang=en)

This is a bad time to talk about it: [“I can’t believe you’re asking a question on Epstein at a time like this, where we’re having some of the greatest success and also tragedy, with what happened in Texas, too.”](https://www.tiktok.com/@cnbc/video/7524769230823132471?lang=en)

If there was anything incriminating about [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) in the files, the [Biden administration](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) would have released it: [“If there was ANYTHING in there that could have hurt the MAGA Movement, why didn’t they use it?”](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/14/politics/epstein-fallout-trump-maga)

The [Biden administration](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) might have added false information to the files: [“You know, the Biden administration ran that for four years. I can imagine what they put into files.”](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-interview-john-solomon-amanda-head-real-americas-voice-july-16-2025/)

Or maybe the [Obama administration](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/): [“These files were made up by Comey, they were made up by Obama, they were made up by the Biden.”](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/maurene-comey-daughter-james-comey-fired-sean-combs-ghislaine-maxwell-rcna219236)

It’s all a hoax: [“I call it the Epstein hoax.”](https://www.rev.com/transcripts/trump-welcomes-prince-of-bahrain)

> *Either the files are boring but true, or they are salacious but a hoax.*

As before, these arguments abound with contradictions. Either there's incriminating information in the Epstein files, or there isn't. Either the files are boring but true, or they are salacious but a hoax. He can't simultaneously argue that the files are not very interesting but also hint that a secret cabal of [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) planted explosive information in them. (At one point, he literally said of the records "it's sordid, but it's boring.")

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) put birtherism to rest by admitting he was wrong. It worked because as its chief proponent, he could effectively exonerate [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) of his baseless claims. Once again, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was one of the superspreaders of the Epstein conspiracy theories. But this time, he can't exonerate himself, and there's no one else who has the credibility to do it either.

If we wait a few days, he may even have a new argument.
