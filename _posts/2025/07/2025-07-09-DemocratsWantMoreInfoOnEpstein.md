## [As Trump tries to shut down Epstein questions, more Democrats starting asking them](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-tries-shut-epstein-questions-democrats-starting-asking-rcna217707)

*The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) wants to end the public conversation about the late millionaire pedophile as quickly as he can. Those efforts appear to be failing.*

July 9, 2025, 9:01 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

There’s no great mystery as to how and why much of [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s base has focused obsessively on conspiracy theories surrounding the late millionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, who died behind bars in 2019 while facing federal charges of child sex trafficking. The right has fixated on the story because members of the president’s team, for all intents and purposes, told them to.

Some made the comments before they took office, others during their tenure, but from [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) to [Vice President JD Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) to [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Director Kash Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel), some of the high-profile and powerful figures in [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s orbit [stoked these fires for years](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/08/jeffrey-epstein-bondi-patel-trump/).

Now, they’re [trying to put that fire out](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/team-trump-struggles-control-epstein-client-list-fire-helped-create-rcna217441), telling the right that [the conspiracy theories aren’t true](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/08/us/politics/trump-epstein.html), and rank-and-file conservatives [clearly aren’t pleased with the reversals](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/doj-memo-jeffrey-epstein-theories-angers-conservatives-rcna217272).

It was against this backdrop that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) held another [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Cabinet meeting](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet), where a reporter asked about the controversy. As [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-netanyahu-congress-ukraine-iran-gaza-tariffs-live-updates-rcna217064/rcrd84595?canonicalCard=true), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) tried his best to shut down the entire line of inquiry.

> *[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) criticized a reporter for asking a question about Jeffrey Epstein after the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) put out a memo saying there was no evidence that there was an ‘incriminating ‘client list,’ which prompted anger from right-wing personalities. ‘Are people still talking about this guy, this creep?’ [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said, seemingly frustrated by the attention being paid to the subject over others he and his Cabinet members were emphasizing. ‘That is unbelievable.’*

The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) went on to suggest that the reporter was wasting time with his question, given that there were more important things to talk about.

It was a curious response. For example, the idea that the Q&A should focus exclusively on more pressing matters was contradicted by [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) using the same gathering to talk about [Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/)’s handling of the [Afghanistan](https://moi.gov.af/) withdrawal four years ago and his thoughts on interior decorating at the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).

For that matter, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) made it sound as if there was no point in relitigating the recent past, despite the inconvenient fact that (a) the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/)’s memo on the Epstein investigation came out [just one day earlier](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/team-trump-struggles-control-epstein-client-list-fire-helped-create-rcna217441), making it quite timely; and (b) there’s little [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) loves more than relitigating the recent past (see his near-constant focus on his 2020 election defeat, for example).

That said, the underlying point of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s overly defensive reaction to a reporter’s question seemed to be part of an unsubtle strategy: He apparently wants the public discussion to end as quickly as possible. As [The New Republic reported](https://newrepublic.com/post/197718/house-democrats-demand-release-epstein-files-naming-trump), several congressional Democrats apparently have a different approach in mind.

> *[House](https://www.house.gov/) [Judiciary Committee](https://judiciary.house.gov/) Ranking Member [Jamie Raskin](https://raskin.house.gov/), along with 15 more of the 19 Democrats on the committee, demanded in a letter Tuesday that [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) release ‘Epstein file’ documents mentioning [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). The letter, which rails against [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) for potentially withholding information that would embarrass the president, comes as the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) earlier this week released a memo closing the case of Jeffrey Epstein, and concluding — to the chagrin of many MAGA hard-liners — that there was no list of clients maintained by the sex offender and disgraced financier.*

The correspondence came one day after [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [Sen.]() [Ron Wyden]() of [Oregon]() said online that [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general)’s handling of this mess “[reeks of a coverup](https://bsky.app/profile/wyden.senate.gov/post/3ltfxcuf4y22y).”

I don’t imagine [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) will respond to the [House Democrats]()' request in a constructive way, but the effort is itself notable because the story is crossing partisan and ideological lines in ways we don’t often see.

The loudest pushback to this week’s developments in the story has come from the right, but it’s not congressional [Republicans](), who are usually aligned with the [GOP]() base and its interests, demanding more information. Rather, it’s progressive [Democrats]() in the [House](https://www.house.gov/) who are seeking answers to the questions conservatives are asking.

All of which suggests [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s efforts to end the conversation aren’t going as well as he’d like.
