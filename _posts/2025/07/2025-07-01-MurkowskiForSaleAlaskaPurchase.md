## [Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski criticizes megabill after voting for it: ‘We’re not there yet’](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/alaskas-lisa-murkowski-criticizes-megabill-voting-re-not-yet-rcna216281)

*The [Republican senator](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/) tried to explain why she advanced a far-right megabill despite serious reservations, but her reasoning doesn’t make sense.*

July 1, 2025, 1:43 PM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

Around this time eight years ago, [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) had already passed a right-wing heath care bill intended to “repeal and replace” the [Affordable Care Act](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf), but [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) were struggling to keep their members in line. [Lisa Murkowski (T-AK)](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/), in particular, said she simply couldn’t get on board.

To win her over, [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) leaders came up with a variety of ideas intended to help [Alaskans](https://www.alaska.gov/) so they wouldn’t feel the punishments that [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) were eager to impose on the rest of the country. The [proposed carve-outs and schemes](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/gop-eyes-special-side-deal-buy-key-senators-health-care-vote-msna1023011) were even given memorable, albeit unflattering, nicknames: “Alaska Purchase,” “Klondike Kickback” and, my personal favorite, “Polar Payoff.”

The core of the party’s offer was simple: If [Murkowski](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/) let [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) repeal [Obamacare](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf), [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) leaders would agree to let [Alaska](https://www.alaska.gov/) keep [Obamacare](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf).

It didn’t work. [Murkowski](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/) remained unconvinced, and she ultimately helped derail the gambit and rescue the country’s health care system.

Eight years later, [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) once again launched a far-right endeavor, once again relied on the budget reconciliation process, once again struggled to nail down intraparty support, once again faced skepticism from [Murkowski](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/), and once again offered carve-outs and schemes that would help shield [Alaska](https://www.alaska.gov/) from the effects of the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/)’s own agenda.

This time, however, it did work. [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-final-vote-trump-big-beautiful-bill-republicans-rcna216096):

> *[Murkowski](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/), who had expressed concerns throughout the process about the bill’s cuts to social safety net programs, was a key vote for [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Majority Leader](https://bioguide.congress.gov/search/bio/T000250) [John Thune (T-SD)](https://www.thune.senate.gov/), to win over. ‘I struggled mightily with the impact on the most vulnerable in this country, when you look to [Medicaid](https://www.medicaid.gov/) and [SNAP](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program),’ [Murkowski](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/) told reporters after the vote, adding that she didn’t get ‘everything’ she wanted but ‘I had to look on balance.’*

Even more striking, however, was something the [Alaska Republican](https://www.gop.com/) said after the dust settled on the dramatic vote: [Murkowski](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/) said she hopes [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) make changes to the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/)’s version of the bill.

“We do not have a perfect bill by any stretch of the imagination,” she told reporters. “My hope is that [House](https://www.house.gov/) is going to look at this and recognize that we’re not there yet.”

In a separate interview, Murkowski [explicitly said](https://x.com/ryanobles/status/1940093824212046118), “Do I like this bill? No."

Asked why she voted for a bill that she believes needs to be improved before passage, the senator added that she simply hoped to keep the process moving. “Kill it and it’s gone,” [Murkowski concluded](https://x.com/BrendanPedersen/status/1940084085562528074).

This is quite odd, even by congressional standards. [Murkowski](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/) is apparently under the impression that the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/)’s version of the inaptly named [One Big Beautiful Bill Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text) is simply the latest iteration in an ongoing series, and that the package will continue to evolve in the coming days. By this reasoning, the [Alaskan](https://www.alaska.gov/)’s vote was less of an endorsement of this specific proposal and more of a way to keep the process going.

But that’s a difficult position to take seriously. For one thing, if she’d joined the bipartisan minority that opposed this bill, it wouldn’t have “killed” the legislation; it would’ve opened the door to a new round of negotiations in the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) — where [Murkowski](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/) could’ve exercised enormous influence. By giving up her leverage, she’s apparently hoping to see [House](https://www.house.gov/) members do the work she could’ve been involved in directly.

For another, [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) leaders fundamentally disagree with her entire vision of the process. [Murkowski](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/) apparently believes it’ll be up to the [House](https://www.house.gov/) to “recognize that we’re not there yet,” but as far as the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) leaders are concerned, the negotiations are over. There’s nothing left to talk about. The bill is done. The [House](https://www.house.gov/)’s job is to approve it, as is, quickly and with as little fuss as possible.

If, [as expected](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/senate-republicans-advance-far-right-megabill-can-pass-house-rcna216257), [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) do as they’re told and approve the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) version of the bill without changes, it means [Murkowski](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/) will have made it possible to implement the most regressive piece of legislation in modern history — a bill she admits remains flawed and in need of changes — and that will further mean that she bears responsibility for the consequences the package imposes on the nation.
