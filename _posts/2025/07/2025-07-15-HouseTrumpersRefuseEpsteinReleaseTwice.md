## [House Republicans reject effort to release Jeffrey Epstein files — twice](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/epstein-files-house-republicans-vote-rcna218971)

*As congressional [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) say they’d like to see more meaningful transparency related to the Epstein case, their votes suggest otherwise.*

July 15, 2025, 3:55 PM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

[Congressional](https://www.congress.gov/) [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) have traditionally taken little interest in the Jeffrey Epstein saga, but as [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his team struggle to defend their handling of the matter, and the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s base expresses outrage, the party appears now to be operating under the axiom “when your foes are drowning, throw them an anvil.”

[NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/conservatives-congress-break-trump-handling-epstein-files-rcna218850) on the first [Democratic](https,://www.democrats.org/) effort to force the release of the investigatory files surrounding the late millionaire pedophile.

> *On Monday night, [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) offered an amendment in the [House Rules Committee](https://rules.house.gov/) to require a floor vote on releasing the Epstein files. [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/), who control the Rules panel, voted it down 7-5. Notably, [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Ralph Norman (T-SC5)](https://norman.house.gov/), a member of the conservative [House Freedom Caucus](https://freedomcaucus.org/), voted for the [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) amendment. And another [HFC](https://freedomcaucus.org/) member, [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Chip Roy (T-TX23)](https://roy.house.gov/), didn’t vote.*

Less than 24 hours later, as [The New Republic noted](https://newrepublic.com/post/197987/house-republicans-vote-block-epstein-files), it happened again, this time on the [House](https://www.house.gov/) floor.

> *[House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) on Tuesday blocked a rule to release the Epstein files, with zero [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) supporting the measure. The final vote was 211 to 210. One [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) with a spine would have tipped the scale and given the American people greater transparency on the Epstein saga. [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) attempted to force a vote on releasing the Epstein files, after [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) struck down an amendment in the [House Rules](https://rules.house.gov/) committee on Monday evening. The procedural maneuver, which would have triggered a vote on the amendment requiring [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) to release the files within 30 days, was rejected yet again with all 211 ‘no’ votes coming from [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/).*

It’s worth noting that eight [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) chose not to participate in the vote: [Barry Loudermilk (T-GA11)](https://loudermilk.house.gov/), [Buddy Carter (T-GA1)](https://buddycarter.house.gov/), [Monica De La Cruz (T-TX15)](https://delacruz.house.gov/), [Wesley Hunt (T-TX38)](https://hunt.house.gov/), [Morgan Lutrell (T-TX8)](https://luttrell.house.gov/) and [Michael McCaul (T-TX19)](https://mccaul.house.gov/), [Thomas Massie (T-KY4)](https://massie.house.gov/) and [Andy Ogles (T-TN5)](https://ogles.house.gov/).

[Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Jim McGovern (D-MA2)](https://mcgovern.house.gov/), the ranking member on the [House Rules Committee](https://rules.house.gov/), [told Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/15/epstein-house-democrats-republicans-trump-doj), “These guys have [trafficked] in conspiracy theories for as long as I can remember, and it’s coming home to bite them in the ass, and they don’t know how to deal with it.”

[McGovern](https://mcgovern.house.gov/) added that additional votes like these are probably on the way. “That was probably not the last time that you’re going to see us deal with this issue,” [McGovern](https://mcgovern.house.gov/) said after Tuesday afternoon’s close vote.

Or put another way, as many congressional [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) [suggest they’d like to see more meaningful transparency](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/conservatives-congress-break-trump-handling-epstein-files-rcna218850) related to this debacle, they’ll have other opportunities to prove they mean it.
