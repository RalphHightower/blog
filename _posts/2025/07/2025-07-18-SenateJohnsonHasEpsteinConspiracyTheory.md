## [GOP’s Ron Johnson brings his conspiratorial focus to the Jeffrey Epstein files](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/gops-ron-johnson-brings-conspiratorial-focus-jeffrey-epstein-files-rcna219597)

*The Wisconsin senator has “chain of custody” concerns regarding the Epstein files. The closer one looks at this, the less sense that makes.*

Shortly after [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) grudgingly left the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) following his 2020 defeat, he was effectively banned from most major social media platforms and made few television appearances. In his absence, [The New York Times described](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/21/us/politics/ron-johnson-wisconsin-misinformation.html) [Wisconsin](https://www.wisconsin.gov/Pages/Home.aspx) [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Ron Johnson](https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/) as [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s successor as the [Republican Party](https://www.gop.com/)’s “foremost amplifier of conspiracy theories and disinformation.”

[Ron Johnson (T-WI)](https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/) is the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/)'s conspiracy theories crackpot equivalent of the [House](https://www.house.gov/) of [Marjorie Taylor Greene (T-GA14)](https://greene.house.gov/). Johnson's conspiracy theories include:

 1. [Covid-19](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/ron-johnson-tries-rope-god-his-bizarre-take-vaccines-n1286987)
 2. [Jan. 6 attack](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/ron-johnson-eyes-his-own-investigation-capitol-attack-n1268052)
 3. [vaccines](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/ron-johnsons-line-vaccines-takes-decidedly-weird-turn-rcna27300)
 4. [climate change](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/ron-johnson-suggested-windmills-are-killing-whales-rcna104335)
 5. [the 2020 presidential election](https://americanbridgepac.org/johnson-fact-check-big-lie/)
 6. [the 2024 presidential election](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/finish-line-trump-gop-push-baseless-cheating-claims-rcna178787).
 7. [peddling 9/11 truther claims](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/gops-ron-johnson-peddles-fringe-911-conspiracy-theories-reaches-new-lo-rcna202221)

So it probably didn’t surprise anyone when [Johnson](https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/) sat down with [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/)’s [Jake Tapper](https://www.cnn.com/profiles/jake-tapper-profile#about) and brought a conspiratorial focus to the Jeffrey Epstein files.

“I don’t know what’s in the Epstein files,” [Johnson said](https://transcripts.cnn.com/show/cg/date/2025-07-17/segment/02), before quickly adding, “You know, I do know that the Epstein files are in the custody of the [Biden administration](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/). You know, I don’t know to what extent they’ve added or deleted things.”

The senator went on to express concern about the “chain of custody” with the files.

This didn’t stand out for me because the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) lawmaker is looking at the Epstein story through a conspiratorial lens — for all intents and purposes, [Johnson](https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/) looks at every story through a conspiratorial lens — but rather because his take has come up quite a bit in recent days, especially among [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) aligned with the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).

Indeed, the morning after the [senator](https://www.senate.gov/)’s on-air comments, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) himself [emphasized](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)/114874138131177867) the fact that [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) “controlled the ‘files’ for four years.”

As best as I can tell, the argument is that the Epstein files should be seen as inherently suspect because of possible mischief and political manipulation. It was the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) that investigated, arrested and charged Epstein, who [died while in custody](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/jeffrey-epstein-died-suicide-manhattan-jail-cell-medical-examiner-says-n1041571) in 2019, but the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) left office after his 2020 defeat, at which point rascally [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) could have, as [Johnson](https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/) put it, “added or deleted things.”

For now, let’s put aside the obvious fact that there’s literally no evidence of the [Biden administration](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) altering or manipulating any [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) files for any reason. Let’s instead consider the underlying logic.

Why, exactly, would [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) officials, working in secret, fabricate incriminating evidence in a sex trafficking case — and then do nothing with the fruits of their illicit labor? Or put another way, if nefarious [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) had manipulated the Epstein files, wouldn’t they have leaked them, rather than leaving them on [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/)’s desk?

Why would any conspirators go to the trouble of concocting bogus evidence against political rivals, only then to sit on that evidence until their rivals are in power?

The problem with [Johnson](https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/)’s theory isn’t just that it’s wrong, it’s also bizarre.
