## [Trump’s odd 'Unabomber' story is just the latest example in a worrying trend](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-unabomber-story-biden-cognitive-decline-rcna219453)

*The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s story made no sense — and he also doesn't always appear to know what his own administration is doing.*

July 19, 2025, 6:00 AM EDT
By Michael A. Cohen, [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) Columnist

Earlier this week, [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) told a story that, even for the [least honest president in American history](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/01/24/trumps-false-or-misleading-claims-total-30573-over-four-years/), was notable.

During an energy and technology summit in [Pittsburgh](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) claimed that his uncle John Trump, a former professor at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://www.mit.edu/), taught the Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski. “My uncle was at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/), one of the great professors,” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said. “Fifty-one years, whatever. Longest-serving professor in the history of [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/). Three degrees in nuclear, chemical and math. That’s a smart man.”

> *What is most notable about the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s digression is that none of it was true.*

Though [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has [claimed](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-spins-up-wildly-unbelievable-family-link-to-unabomber/) for years that his deceased uncle is the longest-serving professor at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/), it’s not true, and it has [has been repeatedly debunked](https://www.newsweek.com/fact-check-trump-claims-uncle-longest-serving-professor-mit-1864991?). But [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was only getting started. Kaczynski was one of his uncle’s students, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said. He then asked the audience, “Do you know who Kaczynski was?” and cryptically noted, “There’s very little difference between a madman and a genius.”

According to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), he once had a conversation with John Trump about Kaczynski: “What kind of a student was he, Uncle John?’ Dr. John Trump,” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) asked. “He said, ‘What kind of a student? ‘Man,’ he said, ‘seriously good. ... He’d go around correcting everybody.’ But it didn’t work out too well for him.”

This is an interesting story, but what is most notable about the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s digression is that none of it was true.

First, Kaczynski attended [Harvard](https://www.harvard.edu/), not [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/), so it would be unusual, though not impossible, that this uncle would come in contact with the future Unabomber. (Students at both schools do cross-enroll on occasion, though [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-mike-waltz-tariffs-immigration-arizona-grijalva-live-updates-rcna218470/rcrd85057?canonicalCard=true) the courses Kaczynski took were taught at [Harvard](https://www.harvard.edu/), not [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/).)

Second, John Trump passed away in 1985. Kaczynski committed bombings that killed three people and wounded nearly two dozen others from 1978 to 1995. He was finally arrested in 1996 and sentenced to life in prison in 1998. If both the president and his uncle knew that Kaczynski was the Unabomber more than a decade before his arrest ... now that would be a story!

Asked about [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s making up this story, [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) press secretary Katherine Leavitt [admonished and deflected](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3lu6jtryhez2q). “That with so many issues going on in the world, I’m a little bit surprised you would ask such a question,” said Leavitt.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s Unabomber tale is yet another example of the what can feel like an increasing disconnect from reality. Yet, as with so many of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s recent and unsettling statements, too many in the mainstream media seem uninterested in covering the story. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s Unabomber story has received scant coverage, despite reflecting a repeated pattern of confused and exaggerated statements.

For example, the day after his bizarre digression in [Pittsburgh](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/), Trump complained once again about [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) [Chairman Jerome Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) and [publicly stated](https://x.com/atrupar/status/1945513122795553257), “I was surprised he was appointed.”

The person who appointed [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) was [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) in 2017.

On Monday, at a [White House Faith Office summit](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/faith-office-luncheon-trump-talks-gas-prices-transgender/story?id=123746594), he called [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) “a knucklehead” and a “stupid guy,” derided the intelligence of other politicians, including his former energy secretary Rick Perry, and said former [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) “wasn’t faithful enough and sought to persecute religious leaders.”

At the same gathering, [Trump asserted](https://x.com/atrupar/status/1944813197904535656) that gas prices have “gone to the lowest level in decades. You’re seeing \$1.99, \$1.98, I saw \$1.95 at certain states.”

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has made this claim repeatedly — [two weeks ago](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/02/politics/gas-prices-trump-fact-check) and [several times in April](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/02/politics/gas-prices-trump-fact-check). In fact, the average national gas price has never fallen below \$3 a gallon since [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) took office in January, and [it is](https://gasprices.aaa.com/) currently around \$3.16.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) also appears at times to have very little idea of what’s happening within his own [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/).

> *[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s Unabomber tale is yet another example of the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s increasing disconnect from reality.*

In the run-up to passage of his massive tax and spending bill, he repeatedly claimed that it would [eliminate taxes on Social Security](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/jun/30/donald-trump/trump-tax-social-security-reconciliation-bill/?) — a claim that massively exaggerates the impact of the bill. Of even greater concern is a story that received almost no attention. [NOTUS](https www.notus.org/,) reported that, only days before the legislation was signed into law, [told House Republicans](https://www.notus.org/congress/reconciliation-timeline-slipping-trump) that if the party wants to win elections, it shouldn’t cut [Medicaid](https://www.medicaid.gov/), [Medicare](https://www.medicare.gov/) and [Social Security](https://www.ssa.gov/). According to three sources, one [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) member had to tell [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), “But we’re touching [Medicaid](https://www.medicaid.gov/) in this bill.”

Additionally, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) made an exceedingly odd comment when asked why his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) [had paused military aid shipments](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-reacts-ukraine-weapons-pause-i-would-know-watch-video-2096851) to [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/), going so far as [to ask a reporter](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/08/politics/video/collins-trump-ukraine-weapons-pause-digvid) whether she knew who had ordered the halt.

One might conclude from this compendium of stories that America is in the midst of a governing crisis. The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) of the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) is making up stories, repeatedly making false claims and attacking other public officials.

Yet there’s been little reporting connecting these incidents.

What makes this lack of attention even more ironic is that it was just under three months ago at the [White House Correspondents](https://whca.press/)’ Dinner that [Axios](https://www.axios.com/) reporter [Alex Thompson](https://www.axios.com/authors/athompson) was given the Aldo Beckman Award for Overall Excellence, in recognition of his “aggressive reporting on [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/)” that “revealed the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s cognitive decline was impacting his ability to do his job, information the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) tried to conceal.”

[Thompson](https://www.axios.com/authors/athompson), along with [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/) anchor [Jake Tapper](https://www.cnn.com/profiles/jake-tapper-profile#about), wrote a bestselling book that further explored the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s alleged decline and the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s attempt to conceal his impairment.

In receiving this honor, [Thompson](https://www.axios.com/authors/athompson) upbraided himself and his fellow reporters for dropping the ball on the [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) story.

“[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/)’s decline and its cover-up by the people around him is a reminder that every [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), regardless of party, is capable of deception. But being truth-tellers also means telling the truth about ourselves. We, myself included, missed a lot of this story, and some people trust us less because of it. We bear some responsibility for faith in the media being at such lows.”

Yet, right now, as we speak, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) of the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) is showing substantial, arguably greater public evidence of possible cognitive decline. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) at times is unaware of what is happening inside his administration, can seem clueless about major policy events, and doesn’t always appear to understand the very legislation that he is promoting.

One can certainly debate the extent to which [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) was truly experiencing cognitive decline. But if reporters are going to argue that the media dropped the ball in not giving that story greater coverage, then how does one explain not even talking about what is happening right now?

To quote [Thompson](https://www.axios.com/authors/athompson), where are the truth-tellers about the current occupant of the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)?
