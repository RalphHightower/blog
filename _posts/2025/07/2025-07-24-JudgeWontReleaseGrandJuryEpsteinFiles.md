## [Judge rejects Trump bid to unseal Epstein grand jury transcripts in Florida](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/jeffrey-epstein-grand-jury-transcripts-florida-rcna220605)

*The [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has a separate pending effort to release Epstein-related grand jury transcripts in New York.*

July 23, 2025, 5:18 PM EDT
By [Jordan Rubin](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jordan-rubin-ncpn1301611)

The [Trump administration](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-obama-treason-presidential-immunity-rcna220479) just faced another legal setback in its effort to unseal grand jury transcripts related to [Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/ghislaine-maxwell-blanche-meeting-doj-epstein-trump-rcna220219), as a federal judge in [Florida](https://www.myflorida.com/) on Wednesday rejected the government’s bid to unseal Epstein-related transcripts from investigations in that state.

The rejection follows Tuesday’s [orders from federal judges](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/epstein-grand-jury-transcripts-maxwell-trump-motions-judges-rcna220298) in [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) that told the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) its motions to unseal grand jury transcripts related to Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell in that state were inadequate. The [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) judges gave the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) a week to try again and said Maxwell, an Epstein representative and victims can also weigh in by Aug. 5.

Whatever information comes out of this grand jury litigation will necessarily be more limited than the full scope of information that exists about Epstein.

The flurry of judicial activity comes amid unusual political backlash that [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is attempting to fend off, as even [some supporters](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/07/14/maga-factions-epstein-fallout-reactions-00452358) have questioned his administration’s commitment to releasing the full scope of information related to Epstein, who died by suicide in 2019 while being held on sex trafficking charges. Maxwell was convicted in 2021 of trafficking-related crimes and [is appealing](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-ghislaine-maxwell-appeal-epstein-trump-rcna220042) her convictions to the [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/). The [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) formally opposed her pending high court petition last week, and this week the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) [announced](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/ghislaine-maxwell-blanche-meeting-doj-epstein-trump-rcna220219) it wants to meet with Maxwell, whom the [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Oversight Committee](https://oversight.house.gov/) separately has subpoenaed for a deposition in prison on Aug. 11. She currently has a release date in 2037.

U.S. [House](https://www.msnbc.com/) [Speaker](https://www.speaker.gov/) [Mike Johnson (T-LA4)](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/), [said](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/22/us/politics/mike-johnson-ends-house-session-epstein-vote.html) this week that he’s sending the [House](https://www.house.gov/) home early for the summer to avoid voting on releasing Epstein-related information.

Meanwhile, [The Wall Street Journal reported](https://www.wsj.com/politics/justice-department-told-trump-name-in-epstein-files-727a8038) Wednesday that the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) told [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) in May “that his name was in the Epstein files.” [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/) and [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) have not confirmed the [Journal](https://www.wsj.com/) report, which cited senior administration officials and noted that being mentioned in the Epstein-related records isn’t a sign of wrongdoing. Separately, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) filed a [defamation lawsuit](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/wall-street-journal-trump-epstein-lawsuit-rcna219968?icid=latestpost_bot) last week over an earlier [Journal](https://www.wsj.com/) story [related to him and Epstein](https://www.wsj.com/politics/trump-jeffrey-epstein-birthday-letter-we-have-certain-things-in-common-f918d796?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAhLG7JeR83kQFG5WZueHzcGfgQYSbm0JSic4IsIj39t8SDvJow_arC0MLA3Nw%3D%3D&gaa_ts=68814efa&gaa_sig=BtUNzaSFCs6pLtmvyCBFAGqm-6mcaQsRjgbPyhuVnMspkB-N3Kab6bbnMttp-vBGgOFa3CuFKPKhx3PigZlLhQ%3D%3D). [The Journal](https://www.wsj.com/) quotes [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) spokesperson Steven Cheung as saying in response to the latest report, “This is another fake news story, just like the previous story by [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/).”

In the [Florida](https://www.myflorida.com/) grand jury litigation, [U.S. District Judge Robin Rosenberg](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/content/judge-robin-l-rosenberg) said in [an order](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.693993/gov.uscourts.flsd.693993.4.0.pdf) that her “hands are tied” when it comes to unsealing — a point that she said the government conceded in the litigation. The [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/)-appointed judge said the government couldn’t justify the disclosure based on the federal criminal procedural rules and precedent in the federal circuit covering [Florida](https://www.myflorida.com/). She noted that different precedent controls in the federal circuit covering [New York](https://www.ny.gov/).

So, while the [Florida](https://www.myflorida.com/) denial doesn’t mean the [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) transcripts will necessarily stay sealed, whether they do depends on additional forthcoming filings and litigation there.
