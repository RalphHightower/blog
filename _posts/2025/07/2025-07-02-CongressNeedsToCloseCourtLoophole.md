## [The Supreme Court’s recent rulings are a plea to Congress](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/supreme-court-rulings-congress-trump-casa-injunctions-rcna215988)

*The theme of this term was bigger than just a conservative majority acting like a conservative majority.*

July 2, 2025, 1:35 PM EDT

By [Jessica Levinson](https://www.lls.edu/faculty/facultylistl-r/jessicaalevinson/), [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) Columnist

The [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) [just wrapped up another term](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-emergency-docket-deadline-newsletter-rcna215906) that caused heartache in some and glee in others, largely depending on your legal and political ideology. The [theme of this term](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-birthright-citizenship-rulings-deadline-newsletter-rcna215616), though, was bigger than just [a conservative majority acting like a conservative majority](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-birthright-citizenship-ruling-injunctions-trump-rcna207129). It was [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/)’ failure to assert its authority and its continued decision instead to cede duties and powers to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).

In every major case involving federal statutes, the [court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) made plain that it would hew narrowly to the language in those statutes. To the extent that people or groups are unhappy with those decisions, the [court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) is saying that’s [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/)’ problem to fix, not the [court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/)’s.

> *If we the people want a [single federal judge](https://www.uscourts.gov/) to be able to stop a [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s executive orders, we should ask our [elected representatives](https://www.congress.gov/) to pass a law that says so.*

Let’s start with the biggest and most politically charged case of the term: [Trump v. CASA](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24a884_8n59.pdf). While the case involves the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s executive order on [birthright citizenship](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-14/), the [justices](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) considered a narrower question: whether, under the [Judiciary Act of 1789](https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/federal-judiciary-act), a [federal judge](https://www.uscourts.gov/,) can issue a nationwide injunction to stop a [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s executive order. Typically, [judges](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) have the power to make rulings that affect the people in their courtroom, but not the entire country. The court’s [most junior conservative justice](https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/justices.aspx), [Amy Coney Barrett](https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/justices.aspx), authored a 6-3 opinion finding that, under the nearly 250-year-old federal law, [judges](https://www.uscourts.gov/) do not in fact have the power to issue broad forms of relief that cover the [entire country](https://www.usa.gov/).

Many viewed the [CASA decision](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24a884_8n59.pdf) as the [conservative court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) handing [a win for the Trump administration](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/28/opinion/supreme-court-ketanji-jackson.html). [Justice Sonia Sotomayor](https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/justices.aspx) said that, with the ruling, the majority “[strips federal courts of the ability to safeguard constitutional rights in the face of nationwide executive overreach.](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24a884_8n59.pdf)” In the most dire terms, [Sotomayor](https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/justices.aspx) warned that as a result of the court’s decision, “[No right is safe in a regime where courts cannot fully protect those before them](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24a884_8n59.pdf).”

There’s no doubt that the [court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/,)’s ruling is a win for any current or future inhabitant of the [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). But nothing in the majority opinion suggested that [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) lacks the power to go back and write a different law explicitly providing [federal judges](https://www.uscourts.gov/) with this power. If we the people want a [single federal judge](https://www.uscourts.gov/) to be able to stop a [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s executive orders, we should ask our elected [representatives](https:www.congress.gov/) to pass a law that says so.

Next, consider the case of [Medina v. Planned Parenthood of South Atlantic](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/23-1275_e2pg.pdf), where the court concluded that individual [Medicaid beneficiaries](https://www.medicaid.gov/) did not have a private right to sue in [federal court](https://www.uscourts.gov/) to enforce purported violations of the federal Medicaid law. Back in [2018](https://www.scotusblog.com/2025/06/court-decides-against-planned-parenthood/), [South Carolina](https://www.sc.gov/)’s [governor](https://governor.sc.gov/) attempted to exclude [Planned Parenthood](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/) from the state’s [Medicaid](https://www.medicaid.gov/) program. An individual who had obtained care at [Planned Parenthood](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/) sought to sue [South Carolina](https://www.sc.gov/), arguing that its decision violated the provision of federal [Medicaid](https://www.medicaid.gov/) that allows beneficiaries to obtain health care from any qualified provider. [Justice Neil Gorsuch](https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/justices.aspx) authored the opinion for the majority of the court and concluded that the case could not move forward because the federal [Medicaid](https://www.medicaid.gov/) law did not clearly demonstrate [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/)' “[intent to confer individual rights](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/23-1275_e2pg.pdf).” Once again, the [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) did not conclude that individuals can never sue to vindicate alleged violations of a specific law, but rather that the law needs to be redrafted to let them do so.

Finally, in a unanimous decision authored by liberal [Justice Elena Kagan](https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/justices.aspx), the court [rejected the Mexican government’s attempt](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/23-1141_lkgn.pdf) to hold U.S. gun manufacturers liable for gun violence in that country. There is little doubt that guns made in the U.S. make their way into the hands of [Mexican](https://www.gob.mx/) drug cartels and wreak havoc in that country. But under a federal statute, gun manufacturers are largely immune from liability, and both liberal and conservative justices refused to find an exception to that broad grant of immunity. If we want gun manufacturers to pay for gun violence abroad, we need to tell members of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) to write a different law.

Simply put, this [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) won’t step in when [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) is silent or vague. The [court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) will not patch up holes in outdated laws. The [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/) vests “All legislative Powers … in a [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) of the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/),” yet modern [Congresses](https://www.congress.gov/) have too often sat on their hands or yielded to the [executive branch](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). If you want [federal judges](https://www.uscourts.gov/) to have the power to issue nationwide injunctions to halt a [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s executive orders, or individuals to sue to vindicate their rights under federal [Medicaid](https://www.medicaid.gov/) law, or a foreign country to sue gun manufacturers, speak with your elected representatives. The [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) is not here to be your lawmaker.
