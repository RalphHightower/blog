## [Ken Paxton’s divorce just upended a must-watch Senate primary in Texas](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/texas-senate-ken-paxton-divorce-biblical-republican-primary-rcna218440)

*[Texas](https://www.texas.gov/)' [attorney general](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/) and its [senior senator](https://www.cornyn.senate.gov/) are fighting for [President](https://www.whitehouse.com/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s support.*

July 14, 2025, 3:46 PM EDT
By Steven Monacelli, columnist for [The Barbed Wire](https://thebarbedwire.com/)

A divorce announcement on X last week just upended an already must-watch U.S. [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) race — and sparked a megadrama of [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/)-sized proportions.

[State](https://www.texas.gov/) [Sen.](https://senate.texas.gov/) [Angela Paxton](https://senate.texas.gov/member.php?d=8) announced Thursday that she filed for divorce from [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) [Attorney General](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/) [Ken Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office), after years of the latter facing allegations of public extramarital affairs, criminal indictments and impeachment hearings. In a post on [X](https://x.com/), the [state senator](https://senate.texas.gov/member.php?d=8) said she was filing on “biblical grounds” and “in light of recent discoveries.” For those not fluent in Evangelical, [Texas Monthly](https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/angela-ken-paxton-divorce-biblical-grounds/) provided a translation: “What is ‘biblical grounds’ for divorce? The short answer is: cheating.”

> *The announcement is a well-timed bruising for the long-embattled but seemingly untouchable [attorney general](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/).*

[Angela Paxton](https://senate.texas.gov/member.php?d=8)’s announcement, though, is more than grist for the gossip mill. Since [Ken Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office) is running to unseat U.S. [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [John Cornyn (T-TX)](https://www.cornyn.senate.gov/) and has ​​positioned himself as an “[“anti-establishment MAGA warrior,”](https://www.texastribune.org/2025/07/11/ken-paxton-john-cornyn-texas-senate-fundraising-campaign-finance/)” the post from his [soon-to-be ex-wife](https://senate.texas.gov/member.php?d=8) was met with a torrent of schadenfreude and jeers online. The primary race was already a must-watch: [Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office) just announced a \$2.9 million [fundraising haul](https://www.texastribune.org/2025/07/11/ken-paxton-john-cornyn-texas-senate-fundraising-campaign-finance/) and polls from both [Paxton-allied](https://punchbowl.news/article/campaigns/cornyn-getting-beat-in-new-poll/) and [Cornyn-allied super PACs](https://punchbowl.news/article/campaigns/cornyn-getting-beat-in-new-poll/) show the [attorney general](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/) with [a clear lead](https://punchbowl.news/article/campaigns/cornyn-getting-beat-in-new-poll/) over the [incumbent](https://www.cornyn.senate.gov/), who managed to [outraise Paxton by \$1 million](https://www.texastribune.org/2025/07/11/ken-paxton-john-cornyn-texas-senate-fundraising-campaign-finance/).

Now it promises to be even more expensive and more brutal, as the candidates and their surrogates increasingly engage in highly personal attacks that expand on years-old divides among [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/).

The announcement is a well-timed bruising for the long-embattled but seemingly untouchable [attorney general](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/), who was first elected in 2014 and has since managed to stave off [multiple indictments](https://ballotpedia.org/Securities_fraud_charges_against_Texas_Attorney_General_Ken_Paxton,_2015) and a bitter impeachment attempt that [extensively aired allegations Paxton had an extramarital affair](https://www.texastribune.org/2023/09/11/ken-paxton-affair-impeachment-trial/), [exposed volatile fissures](https://www.texastribune.org/2023/05/28/ken-paxton-impeach-republican-infighting/) within the [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) [GOP](https://www.gop.com/), and sparked an [open civil war](https://www.texastribune.org/2023/09/16/ken-paxton-impeachment-trial-republican-civil-war/) between the hard-right and more centrist leaning wings of the party.

After [Angela Paxton](https://senate.texas.gov/member.php?d=8)’s announcement, [Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office) responded with his own [post on X](https://x.com/KenPaxtonTX/status/1943371224094048566), stating that “after facing the pressures of countless political attacks and public scrutiny” the two “have decided to start a new chapter in our lives.”

“I could not be any more proud or grateful for the incredible family that God has blessed us with, and I remain committed to supporting our amazing children and grandchildren,” he wrote. “I ask for your prayers and privacy at this time.” [Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office) did not comment on [his wife](https://senate.texas.gov/member.php?d=8)’s allegations.

The [National Republican Senatorial Committee](https://www.nrsc.org/) — the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [GOP](https://www.senate.gov/)’s campaign committee — pounced on the news to take a swipe at [Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office). “What [Ken Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office) has put his family through is truly repulsive and disgusting,” [NRSC](https://www.nrsc.org/) [spokesperson Joanna Rodriguez said](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/10/politics/ken-paxton-divorce-texas-senate). “No one should have to endure what [Angela Paxton](https://senate.texas.gov/member.php?d=8) has, and we pray for her as she chooses to stand up for herself and her family during this difficult time.”

The explanation for an official arm of the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) caucus attacking a [GOP](https://www.gop.com/,) candidate goes beyond [Cornyn](https://www.cornyn.senate.gov/) being the incumbent. “[Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) believe, and some [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) fear, [Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office) would be a weaker general candidate who could finally put the [Lone Star State](https://www.texas.gov/) in play,” [Politico reported Monday](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/13/senate-battleground-2026-midterms-00449589?nname=inside-congress&nid=0000014f-1646-d88f-a1cf-5f46b4be0000&nrid=0000014e-f0fd-dd93-ad7f-f8fd63e30002). No [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) has won a statewide race in [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) in more than 30 years, but [Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office) has consistently run behind other [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/,) such as [Gov.](https://gov.texas.gov/) [Greg Abbott](https://gov.texas.gov/governor-abbott), thanks to his record of scandals. And [Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office)’s challenge fits a broader trend of well-funded far-right challengers taking aim at conservative incumbents in [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/).

That history is worth a brief recap.

In 2015, [Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office) was indicted on [felony charges of securities fraud](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/texas-attorney-general-ken-paxton-deal-avoid-trial-rcna145161), including defrauding a then-colleague in the [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) [House](https://house.texas.gov/). The legal battle dragged on until [a settlement was reached in March of last year](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/texas-ag-paxton-agrees-plea-deal-one-pending-scandals-rcna145487), which included [Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office) agreeing to do 100 hours of community service and pay nearly \$300,000 in restitution.

> *When [Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office) asked the [state government](https://www.texas.gov/,) to pay the \$3.3 million, the state Legislature balked.*

In 2020, several of his top aides in the [Office of the Attorney General](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/) [accused him of firing them after reporting him](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/texas-ag-settles-former-aides-reported-fbi-rcna70140) to the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/,) for, in the words of [The Associated Press](https://www.apnews.com/), “misusing his office to help one of his campaign contributors, who also employed a woman with whom the [attorney general](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/) acknowledged having an extramarital affair.”

The contributor, an [Austin real estate developer named [Nate Paul](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natepaul/), was under federal fraud investigation (he was arrested in 2023 and [earlier this year pleaded guilty](https://www.kxan.com/investigations/austin-real-estate-developer-nate-paul-pleads-guilty-ending-federal-fraud-case/) to one count of making false statements to a lending institution). According to [Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office)’s aides, the attorney general used his office to help [Paul](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natepaul/) in a civil lawsuit. In return, the aides said, [Paul employed](https://www.texastribune.org/2023/09/04/ken-paxton-affair-impeachment-trial-marriage/) [Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office)’s alleged mistress and helped [Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office) continue his affair through a secret [Uber](https://www.uber.com/) account that [Paul](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natepaul/) and [Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office) shared. An aide also claimed that [Paul](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natepaul/) paid for [Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office)’s kitchen to be renovated with [granite countertops](https://www.texastribune.org/2023/09/13/ken-paxton-impeachment-trial-drew-wicker/). [Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office) denied the allegations, but eventually offered to settle a lawsuit from the whistleblowers for \$3.3 million.

But [when Paxton asked the state government to pay the \$3.3 million](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/texas-attorney-general-ken-paxtons-impeachment-explainer-rcna86833), the [state Legislature](https://tlc.texas.gov/) balked, with lawmakers undertaking their own investigation of his conduct as [attorney general](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/). In [May 2023](https://www.texastribune.org/2023/05/27/ken-paxton-impeached-texas-attorney-general/), the [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) [House](https://house.texas.gov/) voted overwhelmingly to impeach [Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office). During a trial presided over by [Lt. Gov.](https://www.ltgov.texas.gov/) [Dan Patrick](https://www.ltgov.texas.gov/about/) — who took a [\$3 million](https://www.texastribune.org/2023/09/21/dan-patrick-donation-ken-paxton-pac-impeachment/) donation from a pro-[Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office) PAC in the run-up to the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) proceedings — [acquitted in the Senate](https://www.texastribune.org/2023/09/16/ken-paxton-acquitted-impeachment-texas-attorney-general/) in September 2023. Earlier this month, the [state of Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) agreed to [pay \$6.6 million](https://www.texastribune.org/2025/07/03/ken-paxton-attorney-general-whistleblowers-appeal/) to four of the whistleblowers from taxpayer funds.

Through all these scandals, though, the far right’s support for the [attorney general](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/) hasn’t wavered. In no small part, that’s because [Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office) has long been seen as one of [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s staunchest allies who is willing to go to great lengths to support the [president](https://www.whitehouse.com/)’s agenda. After the 2020 election, for instance, [Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office) asked the [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) to throw out other states’ election results; the [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) [State Bar](https://www.texasbar.com/) filed a complaint alleging that [Paxton “misrepresented”](https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/texas-news/texas-bar-drops-lawsuit-ken-paxton-election-challenge/3749074/) facts in that lawsuit, and only dropped its attempt to discipline the [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) [attorney general](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/) after [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) returned to office. No wonder, then, that MAGA influencers like [Laura Loomer](https://loomered.com/) have jumped into the fray with their own allegations of sordid behavior against the [Cornyn campaign](https://www.cornyn.senate.gov/).

MAGA loyalty to [Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office) is a problem for [Cornyn](https://www.cornyn.senate.gov/) because the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) primary electorate in [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) has shifted further to the right since he was first elected to the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) in 2002. The [senator](https://www.cornyn.senate.gov/)’s favorability ratings have declined relative to statewide elected officials like [Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office), who has seen his political star rise in correlation with the strength of the far right in [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/).

> *Should [Cornyn](https://www.cornyn.senate.gov/) manage to prevent [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) from supporting [Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office), he could have a fighting chance.*

The two have sought to draw sharp distinctions. [Cornyn](https://www.cornyn.senate.gov/) has called [Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office) a [“con man and a fraud”](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2026-election/con-man-vs-anti-trump-years-republican-fighting-fuel-nasty-senate-prim-rcna200479) for his spotted past. [Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office) has branded [Cornyn](https://www.cornyn.senate.gov/) a RINO — [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) In Name Only — for some of his votes, namely [Cornyn](https://www.cornyn.senate.gov/)’s backing of bipartisan legislation on gun safety following the 2022 [Uvalde](https://www.uvaldetx.gov/) school shooting and his support for U.S. aid to [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/).

At this point in the race, [Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office) and [Cornyn](https://www.cornyn.senate.gov/) are fighting for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s support — or at the very least, for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to not weigh in favor of their opponent. Not surprisingly, [Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office) has the edge. Not only has he [received praise](https://www.texastribune.org/2024/05/20/donald-trump-ken-paxton-attorney-general/) from [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), but [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has also [openly criticized Cornyn](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/3533561-trump-slams-cornyn-as-rino-for-bipartisan-senate-deal-on-guns/) as a “RINO” in the past, and [Cornyn](https://www.cornyn.senate.gov/) expressed criticism of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) in [2016](https://ballotpedia.org/How_senators_voted_on_Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)_Cabinet_nominees,_2025) and [2024](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/trump-can-t-win-2024-says-texas-sen-john-cornyn-18106709.php). But in recent months, [Cornyn](https://www.cornyn.senate.gov/) has sought to alter this dynamic by [emphasizing his support](https://www.texastribune.org/2025/06/30/john-cornyn-senate-texas-primary-republicans-trump-paxton/) for the [president](https://www.whitehouse.com/) and allegiance to his agenda, [hiring staffers](https://www.texastribune.org/2025/05/07/texas-john-cornyn-senate-2026-campaign-leadership-ken-paxton-trump/) in [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s orbit, and has [supported all of Trump’s Cabinet appointments](https://ballotpedia.org/How_senators_voted_on_Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)_Cabinet_nominees,_2025).

Should [Cornyn](https://www.cornyn.senate.gov/) manage to prevent [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) from supporting [Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office), he could have a fighting chance — particularly if his allies in the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/,) [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) can convince primary voters that [Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office) is a corrupt and hypocritical philanderer who quotes the Bible but doesn’t follow its precepts. But [Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office) has proven thus far to have Teflon skin and the challenge for [Cornyn](https://www.cornyn.senate.gov/) is getting something to stick.

Whether any of that matters to voters, and whether they hear about any of it at all, are the questions that will ultimately decide this [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) primary. But in the end, given [Cornyn](https://www.cornyn.senate.gov/)’s voting record, the difference will be a matter of degrees for [Texans](https://www.texas.gov/) who hold a dim view of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s agenda.
