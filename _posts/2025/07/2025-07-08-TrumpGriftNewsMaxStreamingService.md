## [Trump Media teams up with Newsmax for Truth+ streaming platform](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-media-newsmax-streaming-truth-plus-propaganda-rcna217348)

*The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s private media company, [Trump Media](https://tmtgcorp.com/), just launched a streaming platform that will air content from Newsmax.*

July 7, 2025, 6:37 PM EDT
By [Ja'han Jones](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jahan-jones-ncpn371241)

On Monday, [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s media company unveiled a television streaming platform called Truth+ and announced that [Newsmax](https://www.newsmax.com/) — [a propaganda outlet known for its pro-Trump content](https://newrepublic.com/article/160373/newsmax-2020-election-trump-tv) — will be a flagship channel.

[As The Wrap reports](https://www.thewrap.com/trump-media-launches-tv-streaming-platform-truth-newsmax/):

> *[Trump Media](https://tmtgcorp.com/), which operates the social media platform [Truth Social](https://truthsocial.com/) used heavily by [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), launched Truth+ globally on Monday, with the flagship [Newsmax](https://www.newsmax.com/) channel available to stream on the platform. [Trump Media](https://tmtgcorp.com/) describes the platform’s focus as “family-friendly live TV channels and on-demand content.”*

[Trump Media](https://tmtgcorp.com/)’s CEO is former Rep. Devin Nunes of California, a MAGA loyalist.

“There is clearly a need globally for fresh perspectives on the great issues of our day, and we’re laying the groundwork to challenge the woke news monolith with hard-hitting, non-woke reporting and commentary,” Nunes said in a statement.

> *That appears to be MAGA-speak for “we’re going to be peddling far-right propaganda worldwide.”*

This means the president is now financially intertwined with a propaganda platform he frequently welcomes into the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) briefing room — an outlet [embroiled in a legal fight over falsehoods it aired regarding the 2020 election](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/22/nx-s1-5336770/newsmax-ceo-ruddy-election-fraud-claims-dominion-court-hearing). And earlier this year, [Newsmax](https://www.newsmax.com/) and MAGA-friendly outlet [The Blaze](https://www.theblaze.com/) were [granted entry to the White House press pool](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/donald-trump-is-turning-the-press-pool-into-a-maga-echo-chamber?srsltid=AfmBOorDMcFUTvnFAiTZA5Nj_1MF71oZd0h-7hk9-efMemkj7G4VpFef), in place of [HuffPost](https://huffpost.com/) and [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/), as part of what appeared to be an effort to add more [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-aligned outlets.

It’s the type of seemingly corrupt setup one imagines [Hungary](https://kormany.hu/)’s illiberal leader, [Viktor Orbán](https://kormany.hu/miniszterelnok/eletrajz), dreaming of back in 2022, [when he advised Republicans](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/20/viktor-orban-cpac-republicans-hungary) that having their “own media” was essential for combating liberals and constructing a society like his, which [Orbán](https://kormany.hu/miniszterelnok/eletrajz) has called an “illiberal democracy.”

It’s possible that Truth+ goes the way of [Truth Social](https://truthsocial.com/) and boasts [only a meager base of users](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/26/business/trump-media-stock-truth-social). But the effectiveness of the streaming platform (or lack thereof) is arguably less disturbing than the fundamental intent, which appears to be to build up the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s propagandistic media empire.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s continued ownership of a private media company [he relies on to help spread propaganda](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/29/us/politics/trump-truth-social-conspiracy-theories.html) should arguably be a scandal in and of itself. And his official, for-profit partnership with a news outlet that reports on him only adds another layer of controversy.
