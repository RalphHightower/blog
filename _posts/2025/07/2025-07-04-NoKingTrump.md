## [The GOP’s unabashed commitment to Trump’s agenda is shameful and un-American](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-independence-day-king-megabill-ice-detention-rcna216333)

*[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) sees himself as a king, and so does his party — and they're spending billions on detention camps.*

July 4, 2025, 6:00 AM EDT

By Adam Gurri, co-founder and editor-in-chief at Liberal Currents

The narrow [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [congressional](https://www.congress.gov/) majority [has passed](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/big-beautiful-bill-house-pass-package-senate-vote-trump-agenda-rcna216448), by an even narrower majority, [an enormous megabill](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/congress-bill-trump-agenda-tax-exempt-wealth-project-47-newsletter-rcna216687). The [unpopularity of its substance](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/many-americans-may-surprised-just-horrible-republicans-megabill-rcna216733) was swept under the rug on [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s say-so, for this was, as [House Speaker](https://www.speaker.gov/) [Mike Johnson (T-LA4)](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) [put it](https://thehill.com/homenews/5380656-gop-bill-advances-rules-committee/), “As the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) said, it’s his bill. It’s not a [House](https://www.house.gov/) bill, it’s not a [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) bill.” Coverage of the bill has focused on cuts to [Medicaid](https://.medicaid.gov/) and handouts to the rich. Less noted, but no less significant, is the enormous infusion of cash into immigration enforcement that will have lasting implications for our system of government and our society.

Among [the charges leveled at King George III](https://www.liberalcurrents.com/unfit-to-be-the-ruler-of-a-free-people-the-anti-american-presidency-of-donald-trump/) in the [Declaration of Independence](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration) was that “He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners.” The founding generation sought to create a large, commercial republic, where freedom of movement was an important pillar of national health.

> *Our [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) would like to see immigration control budgets on par with that of a branch of the military.*

Instead, our current [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and his [party](https://www.gop.com/) have put [budgets for immigration control](https://www.liberalcurrents.com/mass-deportation-is-happening/) on par with that of [a branch of the military](https://www.ausa.org/news/army-unveils-1974-billion-budget-fiscal-2026). Rather than making war with foreign adversaries, they are making war at home, aiming to invest tens of billions of dollars — a little over a quarter of the immigration control budget — just in building detention camps.

Two hundred forty-nine years since our country declared its independence from the [crown](https://www.gov.uk/), the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) finds itself saddled with a would-be king of its own making.

[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/donald-trump) is a man who, as a private citizen and in public office, judges the value of people and things according to their use — and more than that, their subordination — to [his person](https://www.liberalcurrents.com/americas-paths-to-personalism/), and his person alone. Kings need not pretend otherwise, for they enjoy the legal fiction that the good of their person is the good of the polity.

But American [presidents](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) are supposed to be different. They are supposed to serve the people — to be our agent, one who can be removed if he isn’t performing his duties lawfully and to the best of his abilities.

The founding generation envisioned a [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) that was the first branch of government, a place where ambitious statesmen would be a natural check on other ambitious statesmen — ambitious [presidents](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) especially. Even as they failed to anticipate the development of party politics, the loose and geographically varied nature of American parties led to many cases of presidents’ being checked by their own parties in [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/).

Today — for the [Republican Party](https://www.gop.com/), specifically — that is no longer possible. Even out of power, even as seemingly disgraced as he was after [Jan. 6]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}) — even after he seemed to be a specifically electoral loser for the party in both 2020 and 2022 — [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) successfully consolidated his control of the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/). Now, his [approval ratings are sinking fast](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-immigration-deportation-polls-rcna212747), and even the issues like immigration on which he had polled the strongest are underwater.

But [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) has passed a clearly unpopular and nakedly authoritarian bill, for no other reason than that [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wants it. Such obsequiousness is as shameful as it is un-American.

The nearly 2½ centuries of American history were not without their troubles and their wrong turns. Slavery, civil war and segregation are undeniable blots on the record. Nor have we been unwaveringly open to people from other places and cultures — from the Know Nothing Party to the Chinese Exclusion Act to Operation Wetback, our history is heavy with making war at home in various guises.

> *[Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) is moving forward to pass a clearly unpopular and nakedly authoritarian bill, for no other reason than that [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wants it.*

It is a central paradox of our country that some of the very same people who participated in the worst of our history also had large hands in the best of it. Slave owners like Jefferson articulated an egalitarian ideal that would be taken up by abolitionists and civil rights activists. The chronically anti-immigration Henry Cabot Lodge very [nearly passed a bill](https://forummag.com/2022/10/17/the-forgotten-first-voting-rights-act/) that would have given the federal government all the tools that the Voting Rights Act did, 75 years earlier and before Jim Crow had been consolidated. Eisenhower pursued the racist and cruel Operation Wetback but also signed two civil rights acts and protected the Little Rock students.

[Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is not a figure of this kind. He represents the very worst of us, an unmixed blot on our history. A racist in a multiracial society, a xenophobe in a nation of immigrants, a personalist in one of the world’s oldest democracies.

Two hundred forty-nine years into the American experiment, we face a crisis of our own making. For our sake, for the sake of posterity and for the untold millions the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) will seek to terrorize and incarcerate, let us hope it is a crisis we can overcome.
