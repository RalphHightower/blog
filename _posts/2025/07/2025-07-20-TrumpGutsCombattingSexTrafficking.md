title: "Trump Adminstration Guts State Department on Combating Human Trafficking, Sex Trafficking"

## [Amid Epstein fallout, the Trump administration guts even more anti-trafficking efforts](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/epstein-trump-human-trafficking-state-department-tip-office-rcna219689)

*The administration has taken various moves that have undermined the country’s ability to combat human trafficking — including child sex trafficking.*

July 18, 2025, 7:31 PM EDT
By [Ja'han Jones](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jahan-jones-ncpn371241)

Among the people reaping benefits from [Donald Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-texas-redistricting-2026-elections-midterms-rcna218984)’s second term, pedophiles and other sex offenders are certainly on the list.

I’ve [written about the various moves the Trump administration has taken](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-sex-trafficking-justice-department-ocdetf-rcna205400) that have undermined the country’s ability to combat human trafficking — including child sex trafficking — and assist victims. And see [Washington state](https://wa.gov/) for an example of the administration [successfully inhibiting child sex abuse investigations](https://bsky.app/profile/kyledcheney.bsky.social/post/3luat6don7l2f).

And one might have suspected that the ongoing swirl of controversy [surrounding the president’s past friendship with the late alleged sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-threatens-wsj-new-epstein-report-picture-claim-looks-sketchy-rcna219545) would’ve caused this trend to stop. But you’d be wrong.

In light of that, [Mother Jones](https://www.motherjones.com/) reporter [Pema Levy](https://www.motherjones.com/author/pema-levy/) [noted the “ironic” timing](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/07/human-trafficking-state-department-jeffrey-epstein/) of the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s cuts at the [State Department](https://www.state.gov/), which saw [more than 1,300 employees forced out a week ago](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/veteran-us-diplomats-baffled-mass-layoffs-state-department-rcna218433) — including those who worked in the [Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons](https://www.state.gov/bureaus-offices/under-secretary-for-civilian-security-democracy-and-human-rights/office-to-monitor-and-combat-trafficking-in-persons/), also known as the [TIP Office](https://www.state.gov/bureaus-offices/under-secretary-for-foreign-assistance-humanitarian-affairs-and-religious-freedom/office-to-monitor-and-combat-trafficking-in-persons).

Indeed, if [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wanted to appear opposed to sex trafficking, [petulantly dismissing questions about the Justice Department’s handling of Epstein’s case](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/08/trump-epstein-investigation-backlash-00442333) and gutting more anti-trafficking efforts in the same week was an ill-advised strategy. But alas.

[Mother Jones](https://www.motherjones.com/) and [and The 19th](https://19thnews.org/2025/07/trump-administration-human-trafficking/) both reported that about half of the full-time employees working for the [State Department](https://www.state.gov/)’s anti-trafficking office were let go and that remaining employees were told they would be reassigned and see their pay cut.

And the moves are apparently threatening federal assessments of other countries’ anti-trafficking efforts — including a congressionally required review. According to [Mother Jones](https://www.motherjones.com/):

> *"For 25 years, the [TIP Office](https://www.state.gov/bureaus-offices/under-secretary-for-foreign-assistance-humanitarian-affairs-and-religious-freedom/office-to-monitor-and-combat-trafficking-in-persons) has worked to combat human sex and labor trafficking around the world. Its remit includes producing an annual report, as required by [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/), that grades every country on the issue. Those that fail can face economic repercussions from the US, putting teeth into the government’s efforts to end trafficking. This year’s report was due on June 30, but has not been released.*

> *"The [TIP Office](https://www.state.gov/bureaus-offices/under-secretary-for-foreign-assistance-humanitarian-affairs-and-religious-freedom/office-to-monitor-and-combat-trafficking-in-persons) also works with local partners around the world to strengthen civil society groups, train prosecutors, and help other countries combat trafficking. The office’s mission, including managing tens of millions of dollars for these programs, has always had bipartisan support.*

[Mother Jones](https://www.motherjones.com/) quoted a [State Department](https://www.state.gov/) spokesperson as defending the cuts: “The world has changed. As we looked comprehensively across the [Department](https://www.state.gov/), we saw that many of these offices had served an outdated purpose, had strayed from their original purpose, or were simply duplicative.”

Earlier this week, [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Sarah McBride (D-DE0)](https://mcbride.house.gov/)[^10], asked [Deputy Secretary)(https://www.state.gov/biographies/michael-j-rigas) of [State](https://www.state.gov/) [Michael Rigas](https://www.state.gov/biographies/michael-j-rigas) about the cuts [during a House hearing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeI-ETINh7w). [Rigas](https://www.state.gov/biographies/michael-j-rigas) claimed “there was a number of redundant functions” being performed by [TIP Office](https://www.state.gov/bureaus-offices/under-secretary-for-foreign-assistance-humanitarian-affairs-and-religious-freedom/office-to-monitor-and-combat-trafficking-in-persons) employees — but he didn’t offer any examples.

[^10]: @RalphHightower: I am using 0 to denote at-large districts (states with only one [House](https://www.house.gov/) district).

I'll note here that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) officials haven’t provided a shred of evidence backing their claim that this anti-trafficking office — or any of the other such initiatives that have been gutted — is ineffective, redundant or worthy of cuts. So we’re left with a troubling trend without solid explanation.

[Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Sarah McBride (D-DE0)](https://mcbride.house.gov/) questions [Deputy Secretary](https://www.state.gov/biographies/michael-j-rigas) of [State](https://www.state.gov/) for [Management and Resources](https://www.state.gov/biographies/michael-j-rigas) [Michael Rigas](https://www.state.gov/biographies/michael-j-rigas) on the mass layoffs that reduced staff at the [Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons](https://www.state.gov/bureaus-offices/under-secretary-for-foreign-assistance-humanitarian-affairs-and-religious-freedom/office-to-monitor-and-combat-trafficking-in-persons) by 71%.
