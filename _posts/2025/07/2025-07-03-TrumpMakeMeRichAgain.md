## [Trump's businesses weren't doing so well before he took back the presidency](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-businesses-money-presidency-report-rcna216784)

*[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s actions are less "art of the deal" and more "art of the scramble."*

July 3, 2025, 5:06 PM EDT
By [Zeeshan Aleem](https://www.msnbc.com/author/zeeshan-aleem-ncpn1235332)

A [New York Times investigation based on internal Trump Organization documents suggests](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/02/us/trump-finances-crypto.html) that [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was a lot shorter on cash before he returned to the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) than commonly understood. It illuminates once more how [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has exaggerated his supposed business acumen — and what may be motivating his [dogged pursuit of new business ventures as president.](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-conflict-interest-corruption-truth-social-crypto-rcna181181)

The [Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) reports that last year [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s [office building](https://www.trump.com/) in lower Manhattan "generated too little cash to cover its mortgage," many of his [golf courses](https://www.trump.com/) had too few customers to cover costs, and the money that used to come in from his work in television had "dried up."

> *The data suggests that as [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) entered office the second time, he was desperate for cash.*

Long before entering politics, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) had a well-established track record of [failed businesses and financial mismanagement](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/donald-trumps-business-failures-were-very-real). But it's possible that his [first term](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/) in office made things worse. The [Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) reported that a 2021 appraisal of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s highest revenue resort, the [Trump National Doral](https://www.trumpgolfdoral.com/), found that he had spent \$379 million renovating it — but that it was worth only \$297 million. The appraisal, conducted by the firm [Newmark](https://www.nmrk.com/), found that while "[Doral](https://www.trumpgolfdoral.com/), like several of [Mr. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [properties](https://www.trump.com/), was known to benefit from people looking to buy proximity to a [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) during [Mr. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s first term, his managers believed even more potential customers stayed away because of him."

Regardless of the cause, the [Times](https://www.nytimes.com/)' investigation found that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) had little cash on hand in recent years given the size of his [business empire](https://www.trump.com/) — and then came the tremendous costs of legal fees during both his trials and [hundreds of millions from penalties from civil lawsuits.](https://apnews.com/article/trump-fraud-letitia-james-new-york-engoron-38bc3a7f2ccb22555c026e9bf70fd5bb).

The data suggests that as [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) entered office the [second time](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/), he was desperate for cash, which might explain at least some the tenacity with which he has hung onto his shares of [Liars Club](https://truthsocial.com/). It also likely explains why [he and his family](https://www.trump.com/) have pursued so many new ventures and licensing deals for the [Trump Organization](https://www.trump.com/), ranging from watches to [cryptocurrency](https://www.msnbc.com/11th-hour/watch/-unprecedented-trump-rakes-in-hundreds-of-millions-from-crypto-other-ventures-241717317781) to [a mobile phone service](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/the-trump-family-announces-its-newest-business-venture-a-mobile-phone-service). With the power of the [presidency](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) once again linked to the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) name, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and [his family](https://www.trump.com/,) have fresh sources of money coming in to help his longtime businesses and expand his fortune. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s most recently launched [businesses](https://gettrumpmemes.com/) have [increased](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-family-net-worth-crypto-investments/) his fortune by [billions.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/07/02/business/donald-trump-wealth-net-worth.html).

To be clear, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wasn't on the brink of becoming a pauper if he didn't start finding new ways to generate cash — he could've sold parts of [his business](https://www.trump.com/) off to become more liquid. But as far as the story of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is concerned, the new information highlights the gap between his incessant boasts about being a brilliant businessman and the less glamorous reality of how his businesses were functioning. And it sheds light on the urgency with which [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) launched new ventures which have generated appalling financial conflicts of interest that are [even worse in his second term than his first.](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-conflict-interest-corruption-truth-social-crypto-rcna181181). All in all, it's less "art of the deal" and more "art of the scramble."
