President Trump plans on tanking the worldâ€™s stock exchanges on Friday, August 1, 2025 at 12:01 AM when he resumes his trade war with the world. This tax on American businesses and consumers will send the American economy into a Trump-cession. Trump may finally get his wish for the Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates. But it is a very bone-headed way for Trump to get his wish. But the Blameshifter will probably target Biden or Obama for the recession.
Congress has the authority to levy tariffs. 

The oath of office does not mention a person or an office.

"I, Ralph Hightower, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God."
