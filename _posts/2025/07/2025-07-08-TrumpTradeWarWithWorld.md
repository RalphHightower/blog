title: "Trump Plans On Crashing the World's Stock Market on August 1, 2025"
---


[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) plans on tanking the worldâ€™s stock exchanges on Friday, August 1, 2025 at 12:01 AM when he resumes his trade war with the world. This tax on American businesses and consumers will send the American economy into a [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-cession. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) may finally get his wish for the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) [Chair Jerome Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) to lower interest rates. But it is a very bone-headed way for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to get his wish. But the Blameshifter will probably target [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) or [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) for the recession.
[Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) has the authority to levy tariffs. 

The oath of office does not mention a person or an office.

"I, @RalphHightower, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the [Constitution of the United States](https://constitution.congress.gov/) against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God."
