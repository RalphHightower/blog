## [Restarting his trade war, Trump’s tariffs add new chaos and uncertainty to the economy](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/restarting-trade-war-trumps-tariffs-add-new-chaos-uncertainty-economy-rcna217479)

*The heart of the problem is simple: U.S. trade policy isn't supposed to follow the whims of an erratic and ignorant [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) who can't make up his mind.*

July 8, 2025, 10:52 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

As [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [second term](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) got underway, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) declared that there was a poorly defined economic “emergency” that allowed him to unilaterally impose trade tariffs based on little more than his perceptions and whims. With this in mind, on April 2, in a speech filled with [bizarre lies](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-speech-tariffs-fact-check-white-house-rcna199456), the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) announced that it was “Liberation Day” in the United States, and as part of his declaration, he unveiled sweeping international tariffs based on a formula that was [quickly exposed as gibberish](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-white-house-keeps-trying-make-mathematical-formulas-work-rcna199733).

A week later, after insisting that there was [simply no way that Trump would back down](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-pauses-reciprocal-tariffs-90-days-raises-china-stocks-rcna200464) under pressure as his tariff policy rocked global markets and raised the specter of a recession, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [backed down under pressure](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-pauses-reciprocal-tariffs-90-days-raises-china-stocks-rcna200464), pausing much of his failing policy.

The halt was, however, temporary. In fact, the three-month pause was intended to open the door to new trade agreements — and according to the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), Americans could look forward to “[90 deals in 90 days](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/vowing-90-deals-90-days-white-houses-rhetoric-runs-reality-rcna211810).”

Roughly 89 days later, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has [failed entirely](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/vowing-90-deals-90-days-white-houses-rhetoric-runs-reality-rcna211810) to meet his own goals, and as [The New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/07/us/politics/trump-tariffs-japan-south-korea.html), he’s moving forward with his original plan — or at least some variation of it.

> *[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) revived his trade war threat with more than a dozen countries on Monday, telling them that they would face steep tariffs on their exports as of Aug. 1 unless they agreed to trade deals by then. The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) targeted two of America’s closest foreign allies, [Japan](https://www.japan.go.jp/) and [South Korea](https://www.mois.go.kr/), as well as [Malaysia](https://www.malaysia.gov.my/), [Indonesia](https://indonesia.go.id/) and [South Africa](https://www.gov.za/). [Mr. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) also officially extended the timeline for dozens of other countries to agree to deals with the United States or face tariffs, signing an executive order on Monday afternoon delaying the stiff levies that were supposed to snap back on July 9.*

By any fair measure, this entire policy is a shambolic mess.

Late last week, for example, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said his “inclination” was to simply impose new tariffs instead of negotiating new trade deals because [it’s just much easier](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-press-gaggle-before-air-force-one-departure-july-3-2025/).” That wasn’t intended to be funny, but it was amusing to hear the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) effectively admit that failing is easier than succeeding on one of his signature issues.

That set the stage for the rollout of several new tariff rates — similar, [but not identical](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/07/business/trump-tariffs-trade-deals-august-1.html), to the “Liberation Day” rates, for reasons that haven’t yet been explained — which the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) soon after admitted are “[not 100% firm](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-netanyahu-iran-tariff-letters-elon-musk-gop-bill-live-updates-rcna217061/rcrd84539?canonicalCard=true).”

Complicating matters further, after insisting that tariff rates would “boomerang” and snap back into place on July 9, the administration also announced [a new and arbitrary Aug. 1 deadline](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-netanyahu-iran-tariff-letters-elon-musk-gop-bill-live-updates-rcna217061/rcrd84520?canonicalCard=true).

Asked Monday why [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) restarted his trade war by sending letters to [South Korea](https://www.mois.go.kr/) and [Japan](https://www.japan.go.jp/), [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) press secretary Karoline Leavitt [told reporters](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-press-conference-briefing-karoline-leavitt-july-7-2025/), “It’s the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s prerogative and those are the countries he chose.”

And therein lies the point.

We could talk at length about the economic uncertainty that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is creating, the bizarre and amateurish process that has defined the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s entire approach to tariffs, the impact the chaos is creating, the damage this is doing, and even the possibility that the entire agenda could change — and then change again — in the coming hours, days, weeks or months.

But Leavitt’s point is an important one: The entire U.S. trade policy is based on the “prerogatives” of a former television personality who occasionally tries to pretend he understands how tariffs work.

[Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) is supposed to have authority over international commerce, but instead, [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [lawmakers](https://www.congress.gov/) have decided to take a back seat, allowing [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to simply bark incoherent orders.

The system wasn’t designed to work this way; it can’t work this way; and it doesn’t work this way.
