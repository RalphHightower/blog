*How worried are [Lindsey Graham](https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/) and [John Cornyn](https://www.cornyn.senate.gov/) about their primary races? Enough to pretend that Tulsi Gabbard's discredited claims are credible.*

[Sens.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Lindsey Graham (T-SC)](https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/) and [John Cornyn (T-TX)](https://www.cornyn.senate.gov/) have a lot in common. They’re both [Trumpian](https://www.gop.com/) [senators](https://www.senate.gov/). They both have legal backgrounds. They both arrived in the chamber around the same time. They’re both up for re-election in the 2026 midterms.

But just as important, if not more so, is the fact that they’re both facing credible [Trump Party](https://www.gop.com/) primary challenges next year, which in turn has made them desperate to remain in [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s good graces. Indeed, [Cornyn](https://www.cornyn.senate.gov/) and [Graham](https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/) have, in recent months, appeared eager to look for new and creative ways to impress the president, in the hopes of securing an endorsement.

It’s against this backdrop that the [Trumpian](https://www.gop.com/) duo pitched an idea on Thursday. [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-epstein-maxwell-powell-tariffs-immigration-live-updates-rcna219894/rcrd85384?canonicalCard=true):

> *[Sens](https://www.senate.gov/). [Lindsey Graham (T-SC)](https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/), and [John Cornyn (T-TX)](https://www.cornyn.senate.gov/), are calling on [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) to appoint a special counsel at the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) to investigate the former [Obama administration](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) over [Russia](http://government.ru/)’s interference in the 2016 election. The pair of [senators](https://www.senate.gov/) said in a statement today that they want a special counsel ‘to investigate the extent to which [former President Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/), his staff and [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) officials manipulated the U.S. national security apparatus for a political outcome.’*

The longtime [Trump Party](https://www.gop.com/) lawmakers, pointing to [discredited claims](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/tulsi-gabbards-russia-hoax-mistake-s-pushing-wrong-answer-wrong-questi-rcna220828) from [National Intelligence Director](https://www.odni.gov/) [Tulsi Gabbard](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence), added that “the entire [Russia](http://government.ru/) collusion hoax was created by the [Obama Administration](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) to subvert the will of the American people.”

At this point, regular readers are probably thinking that I’m going to spend the next several paragraphs reviewing a series of obvious facts: The [Russia](http://government.ru/) scandal wasn’t a “hoax”; it wasn’t “created” by the [Obama administration](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/); no one tried to “subvert the will of the American people” (at least not until after [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) lost in 2020); no one “manipulated the U.S. national security apparatus” before or after the 2016 election; and there’s obviously no need for a special counsel to scrutinize “evidence” [that’s already been shown to be ridiculous](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/tulsi-gabbards-russia-hoax-mistake-s-pushing-wrong-answer-wrong-questi-rcna220828).

[Cornyn](https://www.cornyn.senate.gov/) and [Graham](https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/), in other words, appear to have brazenly lied about details they really ought to understand.

But while we certainly could have that conversation, let’s instead go in a different direction — and note that the investigation that [Cornyn](https://www.cornyn.senate.gov/) and [Graham](https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/) want (or are at least pretending to want in order to score points with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) already happened.

Not only did the [Trumpian](https://www.gop.com/)-led [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Intelligence Committee](http://www.intelligence.senate.gov/) look for evidence of the [Obama administration](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) engaging in political manipulation — the panel, led by future [Secretary of](https://www.state.gov/biographies/marco-rubio/) [State](https://www.state.gov/) [Marco Rubio](https://www.state.gov/biographies/marco-rubio/), found nothing — but the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/), in the [president](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/)’s first term, also [appointed John Durham to serve as a special counsel](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-struggle-point-failed-durham-probe-rcna90593) to scrutinize the origins of the [Russia](http://government.ru/) scandal investigation.

And [he didn’t find anything](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-struggle-point-failed-durham-probe-rcna90593).

All of which leaves us with a straightforward question: Why would two highly experienced [U.S. senators](https://www.senate.gov/) with extensive legal backgrounds call for a special counsel investigation that’s already happened in the recent past?

I won’t pretend to be able to read [Graham](https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/)’s and [Cornyn](https://www.cornyn.senate.gov/)’s minds, but it’s hardly outlandish to think these guys are really concerned about their 2026 primary races.

As for whether there might be a spectacularly unnecessary special counsel investigation anyway, the [Trumpian](https://www.gop.com/) base probably shouldn’t get its hopes up: [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-epstein-maxwell-powell-tariffs-immigration-live-updates-rcna219894/rcrd85400?canonicalCard=true) that the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) isn’t overly fond of the idea, fearing that such a probe would take control of the story away from [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/).

### [New Evidence Uncovers Obama-Directed Creation of False Intelligence Report Used to Launch Years-long Coup to Undermine President Trump and the American People](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/press-releases-2025/4090-pr-18-25)

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
ODNI News Release No. 18-25
July 23, 2025



New Evidence Uncovers Obama-Directed Creation of False Intelligence Report Used to Launch Years-long Coup to Undermine President Trump and the American People
WASHINGTON, D.C. – On Wednesday, at the President’s direction and with support of the HPSCI Chairman Rick Crawford, Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Tulsi Gabbard released a declassified oversight majority staff report produced by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) in September 2020 that details how the Obama Administration manufactured an Intelligence Community Assessment they knew was false.

The ODNI records released on Friday, Senator Chuck Grassley’s release on Monday of the appendix to the DOJ OIG’s June 2018 report known as the “Clinton annex,” and the HPSCI oversight report released today confirm a treasonous conspiracy led by President Obama and his national security team, including James Clapper, John Brennan, and James Comey, to manipulate and manufacture intelligence that promoted a contrived false narrative falsely claiming: “Putin aspired to help President-elect Trump’s election chances, when possible, by discrediting Secretary Clinton.”

President Obama directed the creation of this January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment after President Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, and it served as the basis for what was essentially a years-long coup against the duly elected President of the United States, subverting the will of the American people and attempting to delegitimize Donald Trump’s presidency.

>  *“The stunning revelations these intelligence documents expose should concern every American. There is irrefutable evidence detailing how President Obama and his national security team directed the creation of an Intelligence Community Assessment that they knew was false, promoting the contrived narrative that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to help President Trump win, as though it were true. The documents we released shows how they did it: manufacturing findings from shoddy sources, suppressing evidence that disproved their false claims, disobeying IC tradecraft standards, and withholding the truth from the American people,” **said DNI Gabbard**. “In doing so, they conspired to subvert the will of the American people and worked with their partners in the media to promote this lie to undermine the legitimacy of President Trump. This kicked off what would essentially be a yearslong coup against President Trump which included federal investigations, two impeachments, FBI raids on his home, arrests of senior officials, smears and harassment of President Trump and his family, and more. The American people deserve the truth, accountability and justice. The integrity, and therefore the future of our democratic republic demands it.”*

Below are key findings from the HPSCI oversight report:

- Putin’s principal interests relating to the 2016 election **were to undermine faith in the US democratic process, not showing any preference of a certain candidate**.
- **Putin chose not to leak the most damaging and compromising material on Hillary Clinton prior to the election**; instead planning to release it after the election to weaken what Moscow viewed would be an inevitable Clinton presidency. If Russia wanted to help Donald Trump get elected, they would have released this material prior to the election to harm the Clinton campaign.
- **The material about Hilliary Clinton that Putin chose not to release before the election, included possible criminal acts**, including:
    - “Details of secret meetings with multiple named US religious organizations, in which State Department representatives **offered – in exchange for supporting Secretary Clinton – “significant increases in financing” from Department funds and “the patronage” of State** in dealing with ‘post-Soviet countries.”
    - DNC emails detailing that Hillary Clinton suffered from “psycho-emotional problems,” **“uncontrolled fits of anger, aggression, and cheerfulness.” Clinton was allegedly on a daily regimen of “heavy tranquilizers,” and while she was afraid of losing, she remained “obsessed with a thirst for power.”**
    - **CIA Director Brennan and the IC mischaracterized intelligence** and relied on dubious, “substandard” sources to create a contrived false narrative that Putin developed “a clear preference” for Trump.
- CIA Director Brennan and the IC **misled lawmakers by referencing the debunked Steele Dossier to assess “Russian plans and intentions,” which falsely suggested the dossier had intelligence value**.
- **The IC excluded “significant intelligence” and “ignored or selectively quoted” reliable intelligence that contradicted the ICA’s key findings on Putin’s alleged support for Trump, that if included, would have exposed the ICA’s claim was “implausible—if not ridiculous.”**
- **The ICA omitted reliably sourced information, such as how some Russian intelligence officials were “planning for candidate Clinton’s victory” while others assessed “neither Trump nor Clinton” would respect Russian interests.**

As reflected in ODNI documents released on July 18, multiple IC assessments released in the months leading up to the November 2016 elections assessed that Russia had neither the intent nor capability to impact the outcome of the US election.

- On **December 5, 2016**, the FBI and ODNI gave HPSCI its first post-election classified briefing, in which **there was “no mention of Putin ‘aspiring’ to elect Trump” by either agency**.
- The President’s Daily Brief (PDB) drafted **on December 8, 2016** stated that **no Russian or criminal actors impacted vote counts**. This document was pulled hours before it was to be published due to “new guidance.” If it had been published, it would have been briefed to both President Obama and President-elect Donald Trump.
- On **December 9, 2016**, a National Security Council meeting was called with President Obama’s senior national security officials, which included CIA Director John Brennan, DNI James Clapper, Susan Rice, Andrew McCabe and others.
- **After the December 9, 2016 secret meeting of Obama national security officials**, DNI Clapper’s assistant sent an email to leaders in the IC with the subject line **“POTUS tasking on Russia Election Meddling,”** and tasking to create a new **“assessment per the President’s request.”**
- The HPSCI oversight report reveals that, “**unlike routine IC analysis, the ICA was a high-profile product ordered by the President**, directed by senior IC agency heads, and created by just five analysts, using one principal drafter. **Production of the ICA was subject to unusual directives from the President and senior political appointees, and particularly DCIA.**”
- **Later that same day, Brennan ordered the inclusion of “substandard reporting” on Russian activities**, which had previously been withheld from publication because the information was judged “to have not met longstanding publication standards.” Some of the information was, later used in the ICA, over the objections of veteran CIA officers, because it was “unclear, or from unknown subsources.”
- CIA Director Brennan overruled senior CIA officers who challenged the ICA’s claims, stating “**we don’t have direct information that Putin wanted to get Trump elected**.
- Yet, the Obama-directed ICA published on January 6, 2017 explicitly stated: “**We assess Putin and the Russian government aspired to help President-elect Trump’s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him.**” The CIA and FBI expressed high confidence in this judgment, while the NSA held moderate confidence.
- However, the HPSCI report reveals “**the ICA did not cite any report where Putin directly indicated helping Trump win was the objective.**”

#### Steele Dossier

We now know one of the source documents the Obama Administration officials used in the creation of the January 2017 ICA was the discredited, unverified Steele Dossier.

- **HPSCI report states: “Contradicting public claims by the DCIA [Brennan] that the dossier ‘was not in any way’ incorporated into the ICA, the dossier was referenced in the ICA main body text and further detailed in a two-page ICA annex.”**

John Brennan lied and denied using the dossier in the ICA because he knew it was a discredited, politically motivated manufactured document. He told senior CIA officials to use it anyway.

- CIA officer to HPSCI staff: **“DCIA [Brennan] refused to remove it, and when confronted with the dossier’s main flaws, [Brennan] responded, ‘Yes, but doesn’t it ring true?’”**

The bipartisan Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) report (Volume 5, 2020) also criticized the FBI’s handling of the Steele Dossier, noting its completely unverified nature and purposeful sidestepping of IC procedure in its use.

#### “High Confidence”

President Obama, Hillary Clinton, John Brennan, James Clapper, James Comey and others, along with their mouthpieces in the media, knowingly lied as they repeated the contrived false narrative they created in the January 2017 ICA with “high confidence” as though it were fact.

- **Obama’s CIA Director, Brennan** stated in a memo to agency staff in December 2016, **“There is strong consensus among us on the scope, nature, and intent of Russian interference in our presidential election.”**
- **Obama’s Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper** was tasked with overseeing the creation of the January 2017 ICA and expressed confidence in its findings. In a 2018 interview with the Harvard Gazette, he said, **“We provided Trump the same classified assessment that President Obama received,” which included the high-confidence judgment that “Putin directly ordered the hacking and election interference.” Clapper further noted, “I think they [Russians] actually influenced the outcome,”** indicating his personal belief in the ICA’s conclusions.

The HPSCI report was updated several times as the Committee received new information, with the most recent version dated September 2020.

The report from today’s release is available on [DNI.gov](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/newsroom/dig/4089-declassified-hpsci-report-on-the-manufactured-russia-hoax). DNI Gabbard will post updates on X ([@DNIGabbard](https://x.com/DNIGabbard)) and Truth Social ([@DNlTulsiGabbard](https://truthsocial.com/@DNITulsiGabbard)).

### [Graham and Cornyn Call for Special Counsel to Investigate Obama Administration's Role in the Russia Collusion Hoax - Press Releases - United States Senator Lindsey Graham](https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=AED10A7F-41CC-418F-9322-EE29AED8D8A1)

July 24, 2025

WASHINGTON -- U.S. Senators [Lindsey Graham (T-South Carolina)]() and [John Cornyn (T-Texas)](), both senior members of the [Senate Judiciary Committee](), today called on U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to appoint a special counsel to investigate the Obama Administration’s involvement in the Russia collusion hoax.

“For the good of the country, we urge Attorney General Bondi to appoint a special counsel to investigate the extent to which former President Obama, his staff and administration officials manipulated the U.S. national security apparatus for a political outcome.

“As we have supported in the past, appointing an independent special counsel would do the country a tremendous service in this case.

“With every piece of information that gets released, it becomes more evident that the entire Russia collusion hoax was created by the Obama Administration to subvert the will of the American people.

“Democrats and the liberal media have been out to get President Trump since 2016. There must be an immediate investigation of what we believe to be an unprecedented and clear abuse of power by a U.S. presidential administration.”

Background:

Last week, Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Tulsi Gabbard released evidence demonstrating that former President Barack Obama and his national security staff manipulated information from the intelligence community in order to insinuate that Russia was attempting to help then-candidate Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election, including:

- In the months leading up to the November 2016 election, the Intelligence Community (IC) assessed that Russia is “probably not trying … to influence the election by using cyber means.”
- On December 7, 2016, after the election, talking points were prepared for DNI James Clapper stating, “Foreign adversaries did not use cyberattacks on election infrastructure to alter the US Presidential election outcome.”
- A declassified copy of the Presidential Daily Brief, which was prepared using intelligence from the CIA, Defense Intelligence Agency, FBI, National Security Agency, Department of Homeland Security, State Department, and open sources, for Obama on December 8, 2016, assessed that “Russian and criminal actors did not impact recent US election results by conducting malicious cyber activities against election infrastructure.”
- That Presidential Daily Brief was scheduled to be published on December 9, 2016, but communications revealed that DNI Clapper’s office stopped its publication “based on some new guidance”.
- On December 9, 2016, Obama gathered top National Security Council Principals for a meeting in the Situation Room that included James Clapper, John Brennan, Susan Rice, John Kerry, Loretta Lynch, Andrew McCabe and others, to discuss Russia.
- After the meeting, DNI Clapper’s Executive Assistant sent an email to IC leaders tasking them with creating a new IC assessment “per the President’s request” that details the “tools Moscow used and actions it took to influence the 2016 election.” It went on to say, “ODNI will lead this effort with participation from CIA, FBI, NSA, and DHS.”
- Obama officials leaked false statements to media outlets, including The Washington Post and The New York Times, claiming, “Russia has attempted through cyber means to interfere in, if not actively influence, the outcome of an election.”
- On January 6, 2017, a new Intelligence Community Assessment was released.
