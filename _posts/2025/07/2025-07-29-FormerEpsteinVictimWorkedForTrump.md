## [Trump jolts Epstein scandal with new comments about Virginia Giuffre and Mar-a-Lago](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-jolts-epstein-scandal-new-comments-virginia-giuffre-mar-lago-spa-rcna221827)

*The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) took the Epstein controversy in a new direction, commenting specifically on one of the most prominent victims of Epstein’s sexual abuse.*

July 29, 2025, 4:20 PM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

The official line from [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his team has long been that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and Jeffrey Epstein had a falling out several years ago. The reason, however, for their split hasn’t been altogether consistent.

There have been some suggestions of late, for example, that the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) banned the late financier for being a “[real creep](https://newrepublic.com/post/198511/donald-trump-explanation-epstein-friendship-ended),” while others have pointed to a falling out over a real estate deal. In recent days, however, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has been leaning into the idea that Epstein [did something “inappropriate”](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-starmer-european-union-china-tariffs-immigration-live-updates-rcna221277/rcrd85478?canonicalCard=true) by hiring people who used to work for him.

Just as a political matter, it’s difficult to understand why [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) would be wedded to this line. After all, it’d be to his benefit to instead say something like, “The more I got to know Epstein, the more I came to realize that I didn’t want anything to do with such a lowlife, so I cut ties.”

But, no. The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) instead has committed to a wildly different line, in which he ended his friendship with Epstein because the late millionaire sex offender tried to poach members of his staff.

In a Q&A with reporters aboard [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/) on Tuesday afternoon, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) not only doubled down on the line, he also elaborated on a specific name for the first time.

“He took people,” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said, referring to Epstein. “And because he took people, I said, ‘Don’t do it anymore. You know, they work for me.” And he took — beyond that, he took some others. Once he did that, that was the end of him. When they steal people, I don’t like it.”

Moments later, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) was asked whether the employees in question were young women. After initially responding that he didn’t want to say, the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) soon after said, “The answer is yes.” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) elaborated:

> *People who work in the spa — great spa, one of the best spas in the world, at [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) — and people were taken out of the spa, hired by him. In other words, gone. And other people would come and complain, ‘This guy is taking people from the spa.’ I didn’t know that. And then when I heard about it, I told him, I said, ‘Listen, we don’t want you taking our people, whether it was spa or not spa. I don’t want you taking people.’ And he was fine. And then not too long after that, he did it again, and I said, ‘Outta here.’*

It was at that point when a different reporter asked whether Virginia Giuffre — one of the most prominent victims of Epstein’s sexual abuse, [who died by suicide](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/virginia-giuffre-one-jeffrey-epsteins-prominent-abuse-survivors-dies-s-rcna203027) a few months ago — was one of the poached employees.

“Uh, I don’t know,” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) initially responded, before quickly adding, “I think she worked at the spa. I think so. I think that was one of the people. He stole her. And by the way, she had no complaints about us, as you know, none whatsoever.”

The on-the-record comments clearly suggested that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) was aware of Giuffre — who was [a teenager when she worked in the spa](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-says-jeffrey-epstein-stole-virginia-giuffre-worked-mar-lago-spa-rcna221810) at [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) — and she was one of the employees [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was annoyed to see go after Epstein “stole” her.

If [White House](http://www.whitehouse.gov/) officials were hoping to see the story start to fade away, those hopes were dashed aboard [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/).
