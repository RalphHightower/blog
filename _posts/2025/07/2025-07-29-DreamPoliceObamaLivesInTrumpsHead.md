title: "The Dream Police: Obama Torments Trump In His Head"
---


## üé§ "Rent-Free Police"
(Parody of Cheap Trick's *The Dream Police*)

The rent-free police, they whisper in his brain (in his brain)  
Obama walks his gilded lane (mental plane)  
He‚Äôs calm and cool, he‚Äôs got that flair  
But now he‚Äôs stuck inside Trump's nightmare  

The deepfake crew, they spin the twisted thread (twisted thread)  
Distorting truths inside his head (dark misled)  
He sees the Oval flash with shame  
Rewrites the past to cast the blame  

He can't stop the visions, can‚Äôt unsee the grace  
The Nobel smile, that global face  
Obama passed a health care bill  
Now Trump‚Äôs stuck chasing envy still  

(Bridge)  
He‚Äôs haunted by that 2016 meet  
Barack was chill while Trump felt beat  
The Correspondents roast still stings  
And feeds his need for meme-fed things  

The rent-free police, they tap on every wall  
Remind him that he‚Äôs not so tall  
Obama‚Äôs living with finesse  
Inside Trump's mind‚Äîa full address  

(Outro)  
He birthered first, then deepfaked next  
Obsessed with status, jealous, vexed  
Now Epstein‚Äôs shadows start to loom  
So he posts Obama in a jail cell room‚Ä¶

### [Trump AI video of Obama at White House shows dangerous obsession](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-obama-ai-video-arrest-concerns-rcna220382)

*The [former president](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) has been living rent-free in his head for years.*

July 24, 2025, 6:00 AM EDT
By Michael Steele, co-host of "The Weeknight"

When [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) won the [presidential](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) election in 2016, then-[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Barack Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) graciously hosted him in the [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), following a tradition of setting aside partisan differences for the greater good of the country.

Though it was only eight years ago, that moment seems like a different era entirely.

Earlier this week, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [posted on social media](https://www.msnbc.com/the-weeknight/watch/-spigot-of-lies-michael-on-trump-s-fake-obama-arrest-video-243600453990) an AI-generated video based on footage of that meeting that showed the former [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) being forcibly detained by the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) and then pacing inside a jail cell.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has once again shown his lack of class and decorum by his depraved use of footage of that meeting.

> *[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has once again shown his lack of class and decorum by his depraved use of footage of that meeting to make an autocratic threat to distract the country from questions about his past associations with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.*

But [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has plenty of [presidential](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) targets to attack. He lost to [Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) and he feuded with [George W. Bush](https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/). He‚Äôs even [raised questions](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-retweets-epstein-conspiracy-theory-claiming-clinton-connection-n1041146) about [Bill Clinton](https://clintonwhitehouse2.archives.gov/)‚Äôs past relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.

So why [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/)? I think we all know the answer.

The AI-generated video was a projection of everything [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) fears and envies about his predecessor: [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/)‚Äôs grace, intellect, global stature and, most of all, the fact that [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/)‚Äôs very presence in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) redefined what power could look like in America.

### C-SPAN: President Obama at the 2011 White House Correspondents' Dinner

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n9mzJhvC-8E?si=Hrq-_qBV55u-qNKg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

It‚Äôs clear that [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) has been living in [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs head rent-free for the last two decades. Some think he first ran for [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) because [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) [made fun of him](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/watch-inside-the-night-president-obama-took-on-donald-trump/) at the [White House Correspondents Association](https://whca.press/) dinner. He mistakenly [called Biden by Obama‚Äôs name](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-confused-obama-biden.html) multiple times while campaigning, once even saying he [beat Obama in 2016](https://x.com/RpsAgainstTrump/status/1703224211399921939). He‚Äôs even claimed he is [healthier than Obama](https://x.com/Acyn/status/1842702225573020001).

[Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) wins the [Nobel Peace Prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/)? [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [spends years obsessing](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/us/politics/trump-nobel-peace-prize.html) about winning it himself. [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) passes a historic health care law? [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) makes it his top priority to overturn it.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is convicted on [34 felony counts by a jury of his peers]({% link NewYork34GuiltyVerdicts.md %})? He posts a deepfake of [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) being arrested.

From global popularity and eloquence to the respect he commands from world leaders and celebrities, [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) is a lasting reminder of everything [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wishes he could be.

The video is gross, but it also suggests that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is worried the walls may be closing in. Facing a debacle over the Epstein files, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is throwing red meat at his base, falsely claiming that [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) may have falsified the records, even though they date back to 2019, long after he left office.

> *[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs political career was born out of [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) hatred.*

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs political career was born out of [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) hatred. It was birtherism that gave him his base, the lie that [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) was foreign, un-American and undeserving of the [presidency](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). Now, with the Epstein scandal escalating, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is reaching for the same playbook: distort, distract and racialize.

In a sense, the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) era has just been one long backlash to [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/).

There is a serious undertone, however.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) isn‚Äôt just sharing a meme. He‚Äôs pulling from the authoritarian playbook by normalizing ‚Äî and even celebrating ‚Äî the concept of a [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) imprisoning his predecessor; especially if that predecessor is Barack [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/). Retribution is vindication; and vindication is at the heart of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs dangerous [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) obsession.
