## [Ghislaine Maxwell makes pardon pitch in letter to Congress about testimony](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/ghislaine-maxwell-pardon-congress-testimony-rcna221803)

*The convicted Jeffrey Epstein co-conspirator is ready to testify to [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/). All she needs is clemency first, her lawyers wrote.*

July 29, 2025, 4:55 PM EDT
By [Jordan Rubin](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jordan-rubin-ncpn1301611)

Ghislaine Maxwell’s lawyers sent a letter Tuesday to [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Oversight Committee](https://oversight.house.gov/) Chairman [James Comer (T-KY1)](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/biden-impeachment-house-republicans-hearing-rcna117602), which doubles as an unofficial pardon application, of sorts, to [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/consumer-product-safety-commission-decision-supreme-court-trump-rcna220673).

The [letter](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26035113/maxwellcomer072925.pdf) formally responds to the committee’s subpoena to depose Maxwell at the [Tallahassee](https://www.talgov.com/Main/Home), [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/), prison where she is serving a [20-year sentence](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/ghislaine-maxwell-sentenced-20-years-prison-conspiring-jeffrey-epstein-sexually-abuse) for conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse minors. Maxwell’s lawyers told the committee in the letter that, for her to testify to [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/), she would need immunity and to put off any testimony until after her [pending Supreme Court petition](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/ghislaine-maxwell-supreme-court-appeal-brief-epstein-trump-rcna221567) and forthcoming habeas corpus petition for release are resolved. They also asked for any questions in advance so she can prepare.

Otherwise, they said in the letter, “Ms. Maxwell will have no choice but to invoke her [Fifth Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-5/) rights.”

Notably, they went on to write, “Of course, in the alternative, if Ms. Maxwell were to receive clemency, she would be willing—and eager—to testify openly and honestly, in public, before [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) in Washington, D.C. She welcomes the opportunity to share the truth and to dispel the many misconceptions and misstatements that have plagued this case from the beginning.” From there, her lawyers listed several claimed injustices of her case and confinement.

A committee spokesperson already [told NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-oversight-committee-rejects-ghislaine-maxwells-request-immunity-rcna221773) on Tuesday that it wouldn’t be granting Maxwell immunity for testimony.

That rejection puts a finer point on what Maxwell would obviously ideally prefer: [a pardon](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/ghislaine-maxwell-trump-pardon-sentencing-doj-rcna221449).

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) hasn’t ruled out giving one to the woman who, the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) just recounted [in opposing](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-1073/365132/20250714161434468_24-1073_Maxwell_Opp.pdf) her pending [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) petition, along with Epstein “would identify vulnerable girls living under difficult circumstances; isolate them from their friends and families, gaining their trust by giving them gifts and pretending to be their friends; normalize the discussion of sexual topics and sexual touching with the girls; and then ‘transition’ to sexual abuse, often through the pretext of [a girl] giving Epstein a massage’” (brackets in the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) filing).

Maxwell’s letter follows her highly unusual meetings last week with [Deputy](https://www.justice.gov/dag/) [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Todd Blanche](https://www.justice.gov/dag/), meetings whose uncertain details [leave open](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/ghislaine-maxwell-trump-pardon-sentencing-doj-rcna221449) the question of whether the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) will seek any formal cooperation or other legal arrangement with Maxwell. [Blanche](https://www.justice.gov/dag/) is one of several lawyers who represented [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) personally before his latest election and who now works in the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) during [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s second term.

While the details of Maxwell’s dealings with [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) last week aren’t public, her lawyers who wrote Tuesday’s letter are well familiar withq them. Whatever their full legal strategy is at this point, it explicitly includes seeking clemency — in a letter alleging an “unfair” prosecution — from a [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) who has complained of [unfair treatment](https://www.npr.org/2018/08/04/635294139/for-president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)-trump-life-is-just-not-fair-and-what-that-means-for-the-rest-of-us) in his own [several criminal cases](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-criminal-cases-election-ask-jordan-rcna177256).
