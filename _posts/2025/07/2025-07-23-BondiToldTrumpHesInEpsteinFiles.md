## [DOJ reportedly told Trump in May that his name is in the Epstein files](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/doj-reportedly-told-trump-may-name-epstein-files-rcna220630)

*A new [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/) report said the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)'s name "appeared multiple times" in the Jeffrey Epstein files — and he was told that during a briefing.*

July 23, 2025, 4:25 PM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

In early June, as [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s relationship with [Elon Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/) deteriorated, the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) megadonor targeted the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) in a rather provocative way. “Time to drop the really big bomb: [Trump is in the Epstein files,” [Musk wrote online](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/elon-musk-trump-derangement-syndrome-rcna211232), adding, “Have a nice day, [DJT](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)!”

Nearly two months later, the tweet is gone, but the claim is relevant anew. [The Wall Street Journal reported](https://www.wsj.com/politics/justice-department-told-trump-name-in-epstein-files-727a8038):

> *When [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) officials reviewed what [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) called a ‘truckload’ of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein earlier this year, they discovered that [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s name appeared multiple times, according to senior [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) officials. In May, [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) and her deputy informed the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) at a meeting in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) that his name was in the Epstein files, the officials said. Many other high-profile figures were also named, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was told.*

Some caveats are in order. Right off the bat, this reporting hasn’t been independently verified by other news organizations, including [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/). What’s more, the fact that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s name reportedly appeared in the Epstein files is notable, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that he and others who were included in the materials were involved in wrongdoing.

As Joyce Vance, a former federal prosecutor and an [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) legal analyst, [explained](https://bsky.app/profile/joycewhitevance.bsky.social/post/3lunqstrdd22d) via Bluesky, “Lots of people’s names end up in an investigative file. It doesn’t necessarily mean they’ve done anything wrong.”

That said, Vance added, what “makes it interesting” is that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) still won’t agree to release the files — the ones he’s apparently included in — after suggesting the opposite during his 2024 [presidential](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) campaign.

What’s more, it was just last week when a reporter asked the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) whether [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) told him that his name appeared in the Epstein files. “No, no,” he responded.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) acknowledged at that point — I believe for the first time — that he’d received a personal briefing on this case, [which was notable in its own right](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jeffrey-epstein-files-trump-pam-bondi-briefing-rcna218948), but the exchange appears even more important now.

Indeed, if the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) was briefed on the investigation and told that his name did appear in the files, it would raise new questions about why the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) felt the need to lie to the public.

What’s more, three days after the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) made those on-camera comments, [NBC News also reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/fbi-personnel-jeffrey-epstein-files-mentioning-trump-dick-durbin-says-rcna219699) that [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Minority Whip Dick Durbin](https://www.durbin.senate.gov/), relying on information from a protected [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) whistleblower disclosure, alleged that [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) personnel were instructed to “flag” any records that mentioned [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) as part of their handling of the Epstein files.

Steven Cheung, a [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) spokesperson, responded to the new [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/) reporting by saying, “The fact is that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) kicked [Epstein] out of his club for being a creep. This is nothing more than a continuation of the fake news stories concocted by the [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) and the liberal media.”

Of course, that wasn’t a denial, per se.

For their part, [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) and [Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche](https://www.justice.gov/) also said in a written statement, “The [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) and [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) reviewed the Epstein Files and reached the conclusion set out in the July 6 memo. Nothing in the files warranted further investigation or prosecution, and we have filed a motion in court to unseal the underlying grand jury transcripts. As part of our routine briefing, we made the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) aware of the findings.”

That wasn’t a denial of the underlying reporting, either.

Finally, there’s [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Director Kash Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel), who used to promote Epstein conspiracy theories before changing direction, who responded to the [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/) with a written statement of his own: “The memo released on July 6th is consistent with the thorough review conducted by the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) and [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/). The criminal leakers and Fake News media tries [sic] tirelessly to undermine [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) with smears and lies, and this story is no different.”
