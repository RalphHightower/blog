*The Epstein scandal has become quicksand for the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) for a variety of reasons, including his own misguided rhetoric about the intensifying story.*

By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

The [Jeffrey Epstein scandal](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/targeting-epsteins-sweetheart-deal-senate-republican-forgets-was-presi-rcna221432) would probably be less of a political fiasco for [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) if the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) were able to stick to a simple, accurate and compelling defense. Alternatively, the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)  could try saying far less about the controversy, which might help keep the story off front pages.

But [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has instead chosen the worst possible path for himself: He just keeps talking about it; his rhetoric is making matters worse; and the result is a [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) who, in a rather literal sense, can’t seem to help himself.


On Monday, the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)  sat alongside [British Prime Minister Keir Starmer](https://www.gov.uk/government/people/keir-starmer) and fielded a series of questions about the late millionaire sex offender, and each answer seemed to get progressively worse.

A possible pardon for Ghislaine Maxwell: Asked whether he’s prepared to rule out a pardon for Epstein’s convicted associate, common sense might’ve suggested that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) close that door. He did largely the opposite, [telling reporters](https://bsky.app/profile/acyn.bsky.social/post/3luzqh3o2f52x), “Well, I’m allowed to give her a pardon, but nobody’s approached me with it. Nobody’s asked me about it.”

He added, “Right now, it would be inappropriate to talk about it,” while talking about it.

His alleged appearances in the Epstein files: Amid recent reporting that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) received a briefing about his name appearing in the Epstein files, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) replied, "Well, I haven’t been overly interested in it. You know, it’s a hoax that’s been built up way beyond proportion. I can say this: Those files were run by the worst scum on earth. They were run by [former FBI Director James] [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey). They were run by [former Attorney General Merrick] Garland. They were run by [former President Joe] [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) and all of the people that actually ran the government, including the autopen. ... They can easily put something in the files that’s a phony.”

At face value, none of this made any sense — [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s political foes wouldn’t have manufactured bogus evidence, inserted it into files, and then left it on [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general)’s desk — but it sounded like the sort of thing someone might say if they were genuinely afraid of potentially incriminating evidence in a group of files.

His falling out with Epstein: The explanation surrounding [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s relationship with Epstein has been a moving target, with some allegations that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) banned Epstein from [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) for being a “[real creep](https://newrepublic.com/post/198511/donald-trump-explanation-epstein-friendship-ended),” while others have pointed to a falling out over a real estate deal. The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [offered a third possibility](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-starmer-european-union-china-tariffs-immigration-live-updates-rcna221277/rcrd85478?canonicalCard=true) on Monday, claiming Epstein did something “inappropriate” by hiring people who worked for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).

The island invitation: As [The New York Times summarized](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/28/us/politics/trump-epstein-files-island.html):

> *[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said on Monday that he had ‘never had the privilege’ of visiting Jeffrey Epstein’s private Caribbean island because he had turned down an invitation from the financier. As part of a continued effort by [Mr. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to distract, deny and deflect from his long-running relationship with Mr. Epstein, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) vigorously denied that he had ever visited Mr. Epstein’s private islands in the Caribbean, while in the same breath baselessly accusing his predecessor, former [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Bill Clinton](https://clintonwhitehouse2.archives.gov/), of visiting the islands, his latest bid at conspiracy deflection.*

“I never went to the island, and [Bill Clinton](https://clintonwhitehouse2.archives.gov/) went there supposedly” a number of times, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said, referring to locations in the [U.S. Virgin Islands](https://www.vi.gov/) where Epstein allegedly trafficked underage girls for sex.

“I never had the privilege of going to his island, and I did turn it down, but a lot of people in [Palm Beach](https://discover.pbc.gov/Pages/Government.aspx) were invited to his island.”

There were a great many ways the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)  could’ve talked about this without using the word “privilege,” but this was the message the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) chose to deliver to the world.

The Epstein scandal has become quicksand for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) for a variety of reasons — including his own misguided rhetoric.
