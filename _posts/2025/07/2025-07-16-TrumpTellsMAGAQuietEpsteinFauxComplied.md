## [Trump told MAGA to be quiet about Jeffrey Epstein. Faux News obeyed.](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-jeffrey-epstein-fox-news-maga-media-rcna218870)

*The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s media allies have mostly followed his marching orders.*

July 16, 2025, 6:00 AM EDT
By [Matt Gertz](https://www.mediamatters.org/author/matt-gertz), senior fellow for [Media Matters for America](https://www.mediamatters.org/)

[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s allies at [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) — and other major MAGA media figures — are obeying his marching orders to stop talking [about Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-epstein-files-maga-rcna218655), the disgraced financier who was awaiting trial on charges that he [sexually abused](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/press-release/file/1180481/dl) dozens of underage girls when he died by suicide in jail in 2019.

[Prominent MAGA voices](https://www.msnbc.com/the-beat-with-ari/watch/trump-s-epstein-crisis-explodes-fallout-triggers-maga-revolt-plunges-admin-into-chaos-243294277601) were in near-open rebellion last week after the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) and [Federal Bureau of Investigation](https://www.fbi.gov/) [issued](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/07/jeffrey-epstein-suicide-client-list-trump-administration) in an unsigned July 6 memo stating that there was no “credible evidence found that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions,” and that investigators “concluded that Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide in his cell.” Those conclusions [contradicted dogmas](https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/maga-media-eat-their-own-after-trump-administration-denies-their-epstein-conspiracy) pushed by [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)ist talking heads — including [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Deputy Director Dan Bongino](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/deputy-director-dan-bongino). Within days, many MAGA diehards were calling for [Attorney General Pam Bondi’s resignation](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/conflict-pam-bondi-dan-bongino-goes-public-adding-team-trump-schisms-rcna218615) or firing.

### By Sunday, the simmering discontent seemed primed to boil over.

By Sunday, the simmering discontent [seemed primed to boil over,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/12/turning-point-usa-conference-concerns-trump/) as [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) anchors and prominent pro-[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) speakers at a summit organized by [Charlie Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/)’s [Turning Point USA](https://www.tpusa.com/) warned that if [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) didn’t listen to his base, he risked losing them. But the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) instead issued a statement that evening in which he stood by [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) and [demanded that his allies](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)/posts/114842356238631061) “not waste Time and Energy” on the Epstein saga.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s statement put to the test the MAGA pundits and influencers who had told their audiences for years that wealthy elites, corrupt officials and the mainstream press were covering up for Epstein. And most of them, particularly [Faux](https://www.foxnews.com/)’s anchors and hosts, promptly bent the knee.

Epstein’s name was brought up [only eight times](https://x.com/MattGertz/status/1945088730852729090) across the network’s programming on Monday, with its first reference coming well into the 6 p.m. hour. By contrast, [Faux](https://www.foxnews.com/) name-checked former [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) 158 times that same day.

[Jesse Watters](https://www.foxnews.com/person/w/jesse-watters), who holds down the 8 p.m. time slot previously held by stars [Bill O’Reilly](https://www.billoreilly.com/) and [Tucker Carlson](https://tuckercarlson.com/), provides a case study of the network’s compliance. The [Faux](https://www.foxnews.com/) host mentioned Epstein’s name across more than 100 episodes of his programs over the last six years. [Watters](https://www.foxnews.com/person/w/jesse-watters) said he was “leading the charge to expose Jeffrey Epstein’s list of fixers, clients, and famous friends,” unlike the corrupt mainstream press whose silence [he claimed](https://www.foxnews.com/video/6343135274112) [aided](https://www.foxnews.com/video/6343135274112) the “powerful people [who] want to keep you from knowing about Epstein’s world.”

But on Monday night, [Watters](https://www.foxnews.com/person/w/jesse-watters) obliged the demands of a powerful person with [myriad, longstanding ties](https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/maga-media-eat-their-own-after-trump-administration-denies-their-epstein-conspiracy#:~:text=their%20erstwhile%20allies.-,The,-truth%20about%20Epstein) to the disgraced financier: [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). The [sole discussion](https://twitter.com/MattGertz/status/1945088730852729090) of the Epstein story on his broadcast came during a segment in which his producer interviewed beachgoers.

[Watters](https://www.foxnews.com/person/w/jesse-watters)’ prime-time colleagues [Sean Hannity](https://www.foxnews.com/person/h/sean-hannity) and [Greg Gutfeld](https://www.foxnews.com/person/g/greg-gutfeld) likewise completely ignored the Epstein story on their Monday broadcasts. In the 7 p.m. slot, [Laura Ingraham](https://www.foxnews.com/person/i/laura-ingraham) offered the [following take](https://www.mediamatters.org/laura-ingraham/laura-ingraham-conservative-influencers-were-eating-their-own-about-epstein): “As conservative influencers were eating their own about Epstein, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) was stealing the show on the one-year anniversary of the day he almost lost his life.”

### In general, MAGA commentators have either gone silent like [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) or are publicly championing the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) line.

The silence from [Watters](https://www.foxnews.com/person/w/jesse-watters) and [Hannity](https://www.foxnews.com/person/h/sean-hannity) is particularly embarrassing because earlier this year [both had claimed](https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/trumps-jeffrey-epstein-post-contradicts-what-top-fox-hosts-have-argued) that members of the so-called “deep state” aimed to keep the Epstein documents from [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) so she couldn’t expose them. The new narrative the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) laid out on Sunday — that the likes of former [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Barack Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/), former Secretary of [State](https://www.state.gov/) Hillary Clinton, and a slew of supposed deep state officials “created” the so-called Epstein files in order to undermine the MAGA movement — contradicts the hosts’ story.

Outside the [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) portion of the MAGA ecosystem, there’s been somewhat more debate about the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) memo. Some MAGA influencers pointed out the absurdity of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s new narrative. “[Barack Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) wrote the Epstein files? LOL. This is outright embarrassing,” [commented Candace Owens](https://x.com/RealCandaceO/status/1944523492634005715) on X. Benny Johnson, responding on a livestream Sunday, mentioned [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s theory and [remarked](https://x.com/AccountableGOP/status/1944188263322866042), “What?”

Others were even more critical, at times even implicating [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) himself. “Either [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) is royally screwed up ... or there is something there and it’s being covered up and the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) blessed it,” said [Megyn Kelly](https://www.megynkelly.com/), a member of the [diaspora of former Faux News hosts](https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/fox-news-diaspora-threatening-networks-business-model) who now compete for its audience. Daily Wire [podcaster](https://www.mediamatters.org/matt-walsh/matt-walsh-epstein-files-there-just-no-option-allows-you-just-you-know-vindicate-trump) [Matt Walsh](https://www.mediamatters.org/matt-walsh/matt-walsh-epstein-files-there-just-no-option-allows-you-just-you-know-vindicate-trump) said, “There just is no option that allows you to just, you know, vindicate the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) entirely.”

But those cases seem like the exceptions — in general, MAGA commentators have either gone silent like Faux News or are publicly championing the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) line.

“Is it time to move on from the Jeffrey Epstein case?” [asked](https://www.mediaite.com/politics/dinesh-dsouza-tells-viewers-its-time-to-move-on-from-epstein-they-have-closed-the-case/?) [podcaster Dinesh D’Souza](https://www.mediaite.com/politics/dinesh-dsouza-tells-viewers-its-time-to-move-on-from-epstein-they-have-closed-the-case/?). “I want to argue the answer is yes.”

“I’m going to just have to defer to [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) on this thing,” [Newsmax](https://www.newsmax.com/)’s [Greg Kelly](https://www.mediamatters.org/greg-kelly/newsmaxs-greg-kelly-im-going-just-have-defer-president-trump-thing-he-actually-knows) [offered](https://www.mediamatters.org/greg-kelly/newsmaxs-greg-kelly-im-going-just-have-defer-president-trump-thing-he-actually-knows).

“I’m done talking about Epstein for the time being,” [Kirk](https://www.mediamatters.org/charlie-kirk/charlie-kirk-im-done-talking-about-epstein-time-being-im-gonna-trust-my-friends) [said](https://www.mediamatters.org/charlie-kirk/charlie-kirk-im-done-talking-about-epstein-time-being-im-gonna-trust-my-friends) Monday. “I’m gonna trust my friends in the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)” (though on Tuesday, [Kirk claimed,](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/charlie-kirk-epstein-coverage-backtrack-b2789665.html) “When I said ‘for the time being,’ I was talking yesterday”).

Cracks [keep forming](https://www.wired.com/story/jeffrey-epstein-list-maga-angry-trump/) in the coalition that united around a shared hatred of the left and put [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) in office. Those fractures will almost certainly continue as his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s actions anger its various factions, and they may even come to threaten [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s cultlike hold over the MAGA movement and the largely sycophantic right-wing media. But we’re not there yet.
