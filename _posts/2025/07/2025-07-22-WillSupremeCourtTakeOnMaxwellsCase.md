## [Why the Supreme Court could take up Ghislaine Maxwell’s appeal over Epstein agreement](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-ghislaine-maxwell-appeal-epstein-trump-rcna220042)

*If the [justices](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) step in, it wouldn’t necessarily have anything to do with the validity of the trafficking charges against the Epstein associate.*

By [Jordan Rubin](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jordan-rubin-ncpn1301611)

[Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [seems to hope](https://www.npr.org/2025/07/17/nx-s1-5469935/epstein-trump-maga-justice-department) that this latest chapter of the [Jeffrey Epstein saga](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/analysis/jeffrey-epstein-files-trump-report-rcna219360) will go away.

But putting aside that he [filed a lawsuit](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/wall-street-journal-trump-epstein-lawsuit-rcna219968) effectively highlighting his relationship with the disgraced financier, the [Supreme Court](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-partisan-impartial-deadline-newsletter-rcna215610) could keep Epstein top of mind into the fall and beyond if it agrees to review his associate [Ghislaine Maxwell](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/epstein-trump-wall-street-journal-letter-rcna219501)’s appeal.

Even if the [justices](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) agree to take [Maxwell’s case](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/jeffrey-epstein-ghislaine-maxwells-sex-crime-convictions-rcna171618), however, that wouldn’t necessarily mean they’re interested in the validity of the underlying charges against her, which involve conspiring with Epstein to traffic minors. Rather, as savvy lawyers do when petitioning the high court, her counsel [presents the issue](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-1073/355252/20250424150144637_24-__PetitionForWritOfCertiorari.pdf) as a general legal matter that needs a nationwide resolution, something the justices are in the business of providing.

In Maxwell’s case, that issue is whether a promise on behalf of the “[United States](https://www.usa.gov/)” or the “[Government](https;//www.usa.gov/)” that’s made by a U.S. attorney in one district binds federal prosecutors in other districts.

That’s important to Maxwell’s case because, she argues, a nonprosecution agreement secured by Epstein in [Florida](https://www.myflorida.com/,) should’ve barred her from being charged in [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) because the agreement said, in part, that “the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) also agrees that it will not institute any criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein.”

She hasn’t succeeded in her argument so far.

The federal circuit court covering [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) rejected Maxwell’s challenge to her 2021 convictions. The appellate panel cited circuit precedent that says agreements only bind the U.S. attorney’s office in the district where the agreement is entered, unless it affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction. There’s “nothing in the NPA that affirmatively shows that the NPA was intended to bind multiple districts,” the [2nd Circuit panel said](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-1073/337362/20250117133905126_22-1426.pdf), referring to Epstein’s nonprosecution agreement.

But in her high court petition, Maxwell said that the circuits are split on the issue and that the [justices](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) should take her case to resolve the split. The [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) filed its [brief opposing review](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-1073/365132/20250714161434468_24-1073_Maxwell_Opp.pdf) last week, reminding the [justices](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) that they had rejected an appeal raising a [similar claim](https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docketfiles/10-7895.htm) and arguing that the high court “should follow the same course here.”

Maxwell will have a chance to file a final reply brief before the [justices](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) consider her petition at a forthcoming private conference. It takes four justices to grant review, and they take up relatively few of the thousands of petitions [filed annually](https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/courtatwork.aspx). So, the odds are against almost any petition, and Maxwell’s is far from a sure thing for review.

Even if the [justices](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) take her appeal, though, they could resolve it in a way that doesn’t help the 63-year-old, whom the federal [Bureau of Prisons](https://www.bop.gov/) [lists as](https://www.bop.gov/inmateloc/) being held in a low-security institution in Tallahassee with a 2037 release date.

While the [justices](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) are still fielding emergency appeals [this summer](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-education-department-mass-firings-decision-rcna212699) after handing down their final opinions of the term [at the end of June](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-birthright-citizenship-rulings-deadline-newsletter-rcna215616), we might not hear whether they’ll take up Maxwell’s case until the fall.

Notably, it’s not just Maxwell against the government. Adding to the notion that there are broader legal issues at play, the [National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers](https://www.nacdl.org/) filed an [amicus brief](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-1073/358461/20250509132003864_24-1073%20Amicus%20Brief.pdf) urging the [justices](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) to take her appeal “to resolve the split among the circuits and ensure that defendants and their counsel can rely on the promises made by the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) in its written agreements.”
