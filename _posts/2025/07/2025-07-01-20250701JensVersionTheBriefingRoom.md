Jen Psaki is back with her latest edition of the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) press briefing, “Jen’s version.” On Monday, Psaki, who served as press secretary under [President Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/), took on some of the questions reporters lobbed at Karoline Leavitt earlier in the day and called out [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s press secretary for her “prop work.”

“In a regular [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), the Briefing Room is — it’s a place where basically journalists get to ask anything they want, and the press secretary answers to the best of his or her ability, representing the [president of the United States](https://www.usa.gov/),” Psaki said. “In this [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), though, as I think we all know, the Briefing Room is often a place where disinformation is spread, misinformation is spread, all in a place the American people are trying to get information.”

“In this [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), though, as I think we all know, the Briefing Room is often a place where disinformation is spread,” Psaki said.

“And sometimes, they practice some light prop work of sorts,” Psaki added, referencing Leavitt’s display of what she said was [the president’s handwritten note](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114773418889111055) to [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) [Chair Jerome Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm).

“This was the press secretary today, bandying about this list of global interest rates, hand-annotated by the president, to be delivered to the chairman of the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/),” Psaki said, while showing a photo of Leavitt holding up the document covered in [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Sharpie](https://www.sharpie.com/) scribbles. “Because, sure, I guess. That is how this [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) does policy, or whatever.”

“And since this [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) does not appear to take these briefings seriously, I figured I would take a shot again at answering some of the questions from today,” Psaki said, before offering her take on the topics making headlines, including the [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/) migrant detention center that has been dubbed [“Alligator Alcatraz,”](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/alligator-alcatraz-florida-detention-trump-fema-immigrants-rcna215109) [Republicans’ megabill](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/big-beautiful-bill-tax-cuts-wealthy-inequality-rcna215574) and whether [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wants [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [New York City](https://www.nyc.gov/) mayoral candidate [Zohran Mamdani](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I6eACFkrfY) deported.

When it came to questions over [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [“big, beautiful bill,”](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/medicaid-cuts-big-beautiful-bill-deaths-rcna215575) Psaki brought out a prop of her own. The former press secretary noted that there is “a whole lot of [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) in [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) who just barely eked out a win last November, or who are in vulnerable purple districts.”

“The midterms are not that far away,” Psaki warned, before displaying a list of [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) at risk of losing their seats. “I’m just gonna say, here’s a little prop, for everyone, of districts to pay attention to.”

You can watch Psaki’s full take on Monday’s White House briefing in the clip above.
