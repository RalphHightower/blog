## The U.S. is the kid who ‘farted at the lunch table’: How Trump’s tariffs are driving away allies

A few months ago, [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) officials paused most of its country-specific tariffs in order to negotiate trade deals. “90 deals in 90 days,” they promised. The deadline has passed, but few deals have emerged. Now, [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is threatening to move forward with his tariffs. “The guy’s doubled down,” observes economist [Justin Wolfers](https://lsa.umich.edu/econ/people/faculty/jwolfers.html), who adds that he’s “terrified” that the tariffs will reignite chaos this summer. And as [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) continues to antagonize dozens of countries, global alliances are shifting and leaving America behind. “Everyone else is off making new friends and we’re the kid that just sat down and farted at the lunch table,” [Wolfers](https://lsa.umich.edu/econ/people/faculty/jwolfers.html) says.
