## [On the Epstein files, what is Speaker Mike Johnson so afraid of?](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/epstein-files-speaker-mike-johnson-afraid-rcna220490)

*Given a choice between doing nothing and allowing members to vote on a bipartisan measure on Epstein transparency, the [House](https://www.house.gov/) [speaker](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) prefers to do nothing.*

July 23, 2025, 10:55 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

[House](https://www.house.gov/) [Trumpian](https://www.gop.com/) leaders planned to get some work done this week before [starting a five-week summer break](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/epstein-files-trump-house-mike-johnson-rcna220266), and as recently as Monday, [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Speaker](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) [Mike Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) told members that he had no intention of sending lawmakers home early.

The [Louisiana](https://www.louisiana.gov/) [Trumpian](https://www.gop.com/) soon after changed his mind — for exceedingly awkward reasons. The chamber’s five-week break became a six-week break because [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) wanted to avoid a vote over the release of the government’s files on the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-cancels-votes-fight-jeffrey-epstein-files-rcna220238):

> *The [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Rules Committee](https://rules.house.gov/) typically passes a rule for legislation on Monday that sets up debate and allows bills to come to the floor for the week. But [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) had promised Monday to force the committee to take more votes on whether to require the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) to release all remaining files from the Epstein case. To avoid embarrassing votes on Epstein, [Trumpian](https://www.gop.com/)s decided to recess the committee and not attempt to pass a rule for bills this week. Without a rule, [Trumpian](https://www.gop.com/)s would be left with nothing to vote on after Wednesday.*

It was just last week when [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) appeared on a prominent far-right podcast and said, in reference to the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/)’s Epstein investigation, “We should put everything out there and let the people decide. I agree with the sentiment that we need to — we need to put it out there.”

But like his commitment not to send members home early, the [House](https://www.house.gov/) [speaker](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) [reversed course without explanation](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/speaker-johnson-reverses-course-epstein-transparency-realigns-trump-rcna220197).

In theory, it would’ve been easy for [Trumpian](https://www.gop.com/) leaders to simply allow votes on the [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) amendments related to Epstein disclosures and transparency. Why didn’t they? Because in practice, [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) leaders know that those amendments would’ve passed with strong bipartisan backing.

Or put another way, the [House](https://www.house.gov/) [speaker](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) — by [his own admission](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/07/23/congress/johnson-epstein-files-maxwell-comer-massie-democrats-00469083) — cut short the chamber’s work, and even scrapped plans to advance bills he likes, all to avoid the [House](https://www.house.gov/) exercising its will on releasing Epstein files. [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) would rather do nothing than allow members to vote on a measure that many of his own allies support.

It’s worth appreciating the underlying motivations. [The New York Times summarized](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/22/us/politics/mike-johnson-ends-house-session-epstein-vote.html):

> *[Mr. Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/)’s decision to shut down the [House](https://www.house.gov/) early was the latest example of how the [speaker](https://www.speaker.gov/) has in many ways ceded the chamber’s independence in order to please or avoid angering [Mr. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). He has deferred to the president on matters large and small, including when it comes to [Congress](https://www.democrats.org/)’s spending power. He quietly maneuvered this year to yield the [House](https://www.house.gov/)’s ability to weigh in on [Mr. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s tariffs, in order to spare [Trumpian](https://www.gop.com/)s from having to cast politically tricky votes on whether to end them. In the case of the Epstein files, House [Trumpian](https://www.gop.com/)s are once again surrendering their institutional autonomy to appease a vengeful president.*

I’ve seen some suggestions in recent days that [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/)’s actions might be motivated by foreknowledge: Perhaps, the argument goes, the [House](https://www.house.gov/) [speaker](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) knows that there’s damaging information about the president in the Epstein files, which is why he seems so desperate to avoid disclosures.

I’m skeptical of this, in part because it’s unlikely that [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) is fully aware of the files’ contents, and in part because of his declaration last week in support of transparency.

The simplest explanation is also the easiest to believe: The [House](https://www.house.gov/) [speaker](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) has effectively accepted the role of a sycophantic [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) employee. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) doesn’t want to see a bipartisan vote in support of disclosures, so [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) has gone to humiliating lengths to deny a bipartisan vote in support of disclosures.

The core question at the heart of this week’s developments on Capitol Hill is obvious: What is [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) so afraid of? The answer is equally clear: He’s afraid of making his boss in the [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) unhappy.

At a [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) event earlier this month, the [House](https://www.house.gov/) [speaker](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) [handed Trump the gavel](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/speaker-mike-johnsons-july-4-gift-trump-reflected-presidents-growing-p-rcna217293) he used after the chamber approved the party’s far-right domestic policy megabill. The symbolic significance of the gesture continues to resonate.
