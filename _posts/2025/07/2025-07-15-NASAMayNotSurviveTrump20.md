## [As Trump taps Sean Duffy for NASA, space agency's future is increasingly in doubt](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-taps-sean-duffy-nasa-space-agencys-future-increasingly-doubt-rcna217951)

*It’s hard not to wonder whether [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) and the United States’ space program will survive the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) 's second term.*

July 10, 2025, 9:00 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

In government, the practice is generally known as “dual-hatting,” which refers to one official taking on the responsibilities of more than one job. [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has embraced the tactic with [a bit too much enthusiasm](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jd-vance-picks-side-job-rnc-breaking-new-historical-ground-rcna197035) lately — [Secretary](https://www.state.gov/biographies/marco-rubio/) of [State](https://www.state.gov/) [Marco Rubio](https://www.state.gov/biographies/marco-rubio/), for example, [has been tasked with four jobs](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/rubios-latest-moves-raise-fresh-doubts-future-national-security-counci-rcna207132) — and the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) added to his list this week. [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-[administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)/live-blog/trump-tariffs-hegseth-netanyahu-doge-immigration-live-updates-rcna217068/rcrd84728?canonicalCard=true):

> *[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) ... appointed [Transportation](https://www.transportation.gov/) [Secretary Sean Duffy](https://www.transportation.gov/meet-secretary/us-transportation-secretary-sean-duffy) as the interim administrator of [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/), making [Duffy](https://www.transportation.gov/meet-secretary/us-transportation-secretary-sean-duffy) the latest [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) official to serve in multiple roles. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said in a [Liars Club](https://truthsocial.com/) post announcing the appointment that [Duffy](https://www.transportation.gov/meet-secretary/us-transportation-secretary-sean-duffy) may serve only ‘for a short period of time.’*

About a month ago, billionaire Jared Isaacman was poised to be easily confirmed as the new [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) administrator, but the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [abruptly pulled his nomination](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/demise-trumps-nasa-pick-different-personnel-failures-rcna210461) at the last minute after concluding that Isaacman wasn’t enough of a far-right partisan. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said he’d announce a new nominee soon after, but that hasn’t yet happened.

Instead, the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [wants](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)/114826109463640311) the [transportation](https://www.transportation.gov/) [secretary](https://www.transportation.gov/meet-secretary/us-transportation-secretary-sean-duffy) — a former [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) host who’s spent much of his tenure [trying to avoid blame](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/faa-sean-duffy-air-travel-rcna206529) for recent failures — to handle both jobs, at least for now.

Whether the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has struggled to find qualified people willing to lead [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/), or whether qualified people have turned down overtures to work for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), is unclear.

What’s more, one of the key elements of this [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) ’s approach to dual-hatting is that his use of the tactic signals an implicit contempt: When [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) taps one person to do two (or more) jobs, it tends to mean that he doesn’t see much value in the underlying positions.

With this in mind, there are growing concerns, not only about [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/)’s leadership, but about the future of the [space agency](https://www.nasa.gov/) itself.

[Politico reported](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/09/nasa-staff-departures-00444674) this week, for example, that “at least 2,145 senior-ranking [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) employees are set to leave under a push to shed staff,” and many of those leaving the [agency](https://www.nasa.gov/) “serve in [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/)’s core mission sets.”

This potentially massive personnel loss dovetails with the new [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) budget, which would cut [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/)’s science budget [nearly in half](https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2025/07/08/nasa-science-missions-at-risk/). [Politico](https://www.politico.com/)’s report added that the proposed spending cuts, if approved by the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/), “would force the [agency](https://www.nasa.gov/) to operate with the smallest budget and staff since the early 1960s” — before the first moon landing.

[Casey Dreier](https://www.planetary.org/profiles/casey-dreier), chief of space policy at the [Planetary Society](https://www.planetary.org/), which advocates for research and exploration in space, recently said the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s budget plan represents an “[extinction-level event](https://www.eenews.net/articles/trump-budget-would-trigger-extinction-level-event-for-nasa/)” for one of the world’s leading science agencies.

Nearly six months ago, in his second inaugural address, [the president declared](https://www.whitehouse.gov/remarks/2025/01/the-inaugural-address/), “We will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars.”

Maybe [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) changed his mind about his space ambitions, or maybe he envisions a privatized system. Either way, it’s hard not to wonder whether [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) and the United States’ [space program](https://www.nasa.gov/) will survive the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)’s second term.
