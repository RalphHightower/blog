## [Trump puts aside his duties at a key moment to promote his new branded fragrance line](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-fragrances-victory-45-47-grifting-rcna216205)

*As the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) launches a “[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) Fragrances,” we're reminded that there is no end to his grifting.*

July 1, 2025, 10:36 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

On Monday night, as [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) scrambled in search of votes to advance the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/)’s far-right domestic policy megabill, [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was using his social media platform to issue [a striking announcement](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114774905224497775):

The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is launching a “[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) Fragrances” line (for men and women). [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-agenda-bill-senate-tillis-medicaid-immigration-live-updates-rcna215837/rcrd83996?canonicalCard=true):

> *‘They’re called ‘Victory 45-47’ because they’re all about Winning, Strength, and Success — For men and women. Get yourself a bottle, and don’t forget to get one for your loved ones too. Enjoy, have fun, and keep winning!’ [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wrote in the post, which included a link to buy the product. The fragrances are the latest in a series of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-branded items he has promoted. Other ventures include the [$TRUMP](https://gettrumpmemes.com/) meme coin, branded watches and apparel — some of which included the slogan ‘Trump 2028.’*

The circumstances are familiar. In the months leading up to [Election Day 2024](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/2024presgeresults.pdf), when [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was ostensibly focused on his candidacy, the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) launched a dizzying merchandising campaign, pitching everything from [Trump-branded watches](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-newest-merchandising-opportunity-ridiculous-rcna172986), [silver Trump commemorative coins](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/elections-trump-pushes-another-merchandising-opportunity-rcna172438), [batches of digital trading cards](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/looking-cash-trump-combines-two-money-making-schemes-rcna168626) to [a weird cryptocurrency project](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/looking-cash-trump-launches-new-family-crypto-project-rcna171431), [gold sneakers](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-gold-sneakers-rcna139551), [Trump-endorsed Bibles](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-backed-bibles-are-latest-entry-cringeworthy-list-rcna145266), [Trump-branded guitars](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-even-elections-wake-selling-much-stuff-rcna185552).

Even after the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) won a second term, the efforts have continued with, among other things, [Trump-branded guitars](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-even-elections-wake-selling-much-stuff-rcna185552) — all of which have [proved quite lucrative for him](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/trumps-financial-disclosures-reveal-millions-income-guitars-bibles-wat-rcna212981), according to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s 2025 financial disclosure statement.

Two weeks ago, his business organization even [launched a phone service called Trump Mobile,](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-mobile-phone-service-t1-rcna213261), complete with a gold-colored smart phone dubbed the T1.

But as “[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) Fragrances” joins the list, I’m reminded of [a straightforward question](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/early-evidence-suggests-trump-will-keep-grifts-going-white-house-rcna188735) a reporter asked the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) on the first full day of his second term in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/): “Do you intend to continue selling products that benefit you personally while you’re [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)?”

Instead of answering the straightforward question, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [questioned the premise](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/early-evidence-suggests-trump-will-keep-grifts-going-white-house-rcna188735), wondering aloud whether he’s actually benefitting personally from his many branded merchandising deals and efforts to monetize his powerful political position. (Months later, his financial disclosure statement [answered the question](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/trumps-financial-disclosures-reveal-millions-income-guitars-bibles-wat-rcna212981).)

But the line of inquiry stood out as memorable because it spoke to a series of assumptions that have unfolded episodically. Looking back over the last few years, observers have long wondered when [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) might stop such side deals and private enterprises. Maybe he’ll stop after he declares his 2024 candidacy, some said. Or maybe he’ll stop after he secures his party’s nomination. Or after the convention. Or after the election. Or after his inauguration.

Or maybe, as [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s latest antics suggest, he simply won’t stop at all.
