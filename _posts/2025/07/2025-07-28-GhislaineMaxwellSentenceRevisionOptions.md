## [A pardon isn't the only legal help the Trump admin could possibly give Ghislaine Maxwell](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/ghislaine-maxwell-trump-pardon-sentencing-doj-rcna221449)

*The [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) is allowed to seek sentencing reductions after sentences are handed down, but it might have a hard time doing so in Maxwell’s case.*

July 28, 2025, 11:16 AM EDT
By [Jordan Rubin](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jordan-rubin-ncpn1301611)

[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is correct that he’s [legally allowed](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-says-hasnt-considered-pardoning-ghislaine-maxwell-allowed-rcna221080) to pardon convicted sex trafficker [Ghislaine Maxwell](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-ghislaine-maxwell-appeal-epstein-trump-rcna220042) if he wants to. That fact has nothing to do with Maxwell herself or the specifics of her case; rather, it simply reflects the reality that [presidents](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) have broad pardon power.

But is [clemency](https://www.justice.gov/pardon/clemency-grants-president-donald-j-trump-2025-present) (a pardon or sentence commutation) the only true legal help that the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) could give her?

Not necessarily. Yet, it may be the most legally straightforward, [depending on what the [administration wants to accomplish](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-ghislaine-maxwell-pardon-unlikely-epstein-case-rcna221335).

Another option is a mechanism available to federal prosecutors to seek sentence reductions. But looking at the text of that mechanism, called [Rule 35](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/rule_35), the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) could have a tough time satisfying its requirements.

That’s because the criminal procedure rule is stricter when more than a year has passed since sentencing, as it has for Maxwell, who was [sentenced](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/ghislaine-maxwell-sentenced-20-years-prison-conspiring-jeffrey-epstein-sexually-abuse) to 20 years in 2022 for conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse minors. She’s currently set for release in 2037. In such situations, the rule says that courts “may” reduce sentences if defendants provide “substantial assistance” toward investigating or prosecuting other people, but only if that assistance involved one of three things:

> *(A) information not known to the defendant until one year or more after sentencing; (B) information provided by the defendant to the government within one year of sentencing, but which did not become useful to the government until more than one year after sentencing; or (C) information the usefulness of which could not reasonably have been anticipated by the defendant until more than one year after sentencing and which was promptly provided to the government after its usefulness was reasonably apparent to the defendant.*

Mindful that we don’t know what Maxwell knows or what she told [Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche](https://www.justice.gov/dag/) in their [highly unusual](https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/-beyond-unusual-lisa-rubin-sounds-alarm-on-doj-meeting-with-ghislaine-maxwell-243699269650) meetings last week, let’s examine each subsection to see the difficulty that the [DOJ]() could face if it wants to go the Rule 35 route.

As to point (A) — “information not known to the defendant until one year or more after sentencing” — it would be odd if Maxwell came into new information only recently. The whole Epstein saga is about things that happened years ago.

As to point (B) — “information provided by the defendant to the government within one year of sentencing, but which did not become useful to the government until more than one year after sentencing” — we don’t know what information she might have provided in the past. But [Blanche](https://www.justice.gov/d/) [suggested that](https://x.com/DAGToddBlanche/status/1947623916538617946) there hadn’t been any cooperation-type communication between the prosecution and defense until now. Plus, it’s unclear why any information she may have provided in the past would only “become useful to the government” now.

Similarly, as to point (C) — “information the usefulness of which could not reasonably have been anticipated by the defendant until more than one year after sentencing and which was promptly provided to the government after its usefulness was reasonably apparent to the defendant” — it would seem that any information Maxwell has about prosecuting people related to sex trafficking would have been useful to the government long ago. Indeed, information about potentially prosecuting people can become less valuable over time.

To be sure, the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) could still attempt a sentencing reduction motion if it wants to. And perhaps it has, or can develop, a stronger case than it seems to have from the outside looking in.

At any rate, the motion would need judicial approval. That raises the specter of another Eric Adams-type situation, following [the DOJ’s failure](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/eric-adams-alina-habba-alien-enemies-act-deadline-newsletter-rcna199777), earlier this year, to convince a judge to let the government dismiss Adams’ criminal corruption case in a way that would have let the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) keep political leverage hanging over [New York City](https://www.nyc.gov/)’s mayor. Would the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) want another drawn-out legal battle only to lose again? (Not that it did much to hurt [Emil Bove](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/emil-bove-confirmation-hearing-eric-adams-trump-rcna215074), the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) lawyer who led the Adams effort and is poised for confirmation by [Senate](https:www.senate.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) to a lifetime judicial appointment.)

The Maxwell pardon speculation also comes as she has a [pending petition](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-ghislaine-maxwell-appeal-epstein-trump-rcna220042) to the [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) to try and overturn her conviction and sentence. The [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) earlier this month [opposed](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-1073/365132/20250714161434468_24-1073_Maxwell_Opp.pdf) the petition — before [Blanche](https://www.justice.gov/dag/) announced he was meeting with Maxwell — and we could learn in the fall whether the justices will take up her appeal. Theoretically, the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) could change its position later in the high court litigation to support her, but in addition to that being unusual and possibly unpersuasive to the justices, it would also not guarantee success for Maxwell; the justices still won’t necessarily review her appeal or rule in her favor if they do review it.

Ultimately, while it’s unclear how pardoning Maxwell or commuting her sentence would absolve [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) politically from the Epstein affair — wouldn’t it make it seem even more like he’s hiding something? — what could make clemency an attractive legal option is that the power is [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s alone to deploy.
