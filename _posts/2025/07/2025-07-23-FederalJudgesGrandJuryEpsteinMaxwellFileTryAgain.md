## [Judges deem Trump motions to unseal Epstein and Maxwell grand jury transcripts inadequate](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/epstein-grand-jury-transcripts-maxwell-trump-motions-judges-rcna220298)

*But the judges gave the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) the chance to do better by July 29. Maxwell, an Epstein representative and the victims can weigh in, too.*

July 22, 2025, 4:48 PM EDT
By [Jordan Rubin](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jordan-rubin-ncpn1301611)

Two federal judges sent a message to the [Trump administration](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-ordered-fix-another-illegal-removal-immigrant-rcna214808) about its attempt to unseal grand jury transcripts related to [Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/wall-street-journal-trump-epstein-lawsuit-rcna219968?icid=latestpost_bot) and [Ghislaine Maxwell](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-ghislaine-maxwell-appeal-epstein-trump-rcna220042): Try again.

[Deputy Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/dag) [Todd Blanche](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-hush-money-trial-witness-testimony-takeaways-rcna149542) had filed unsealing motions on both the [Epstein](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.518649/gov.uscourts.nysd.518649.61.0_4.pdf) and [Maxwell](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.539612/gov.uscourts.nysd.539612.785.0_2.pdf) dockets amid the [political backlash](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-to-know-about-the-maga-faithfuls-anger-over-trump-and-the-epstein-case) President [Donald [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has faced for his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s refusal to make public all Epstein-related materials [as promised](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-jeffrey-epstein-years-including-2024-campaign-trail/story?id=123778541).

Of course, unsealing these grand jury materials wouldn’t disclose all known government information related to Epstein, who died in custody in 2019 in what the medical examiner deemed a suicide.

But even this relatively limited grand jury information won’t be forthcoming, at least not until the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) satisfies legal requirements that it failed to fulfill in Blanche’s unsealing motions.

The judges' orders on Tuesday come as [Blanche](https://www.justice.gov/dag) [announced his intention](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/ghislaine-maxwell-blanche-meeting-doj-epstein-trump-rcna220219) the same day to meet with Maxwell and ask her: [“what do you know?”](https://x.com/DAGToddBlanche/status/1947623916538617946)

[Blanche](https://www.justice.gov/dag) [noted](https://x.com/DAGToddBlanche/status/1947623916538617946) that the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) hadn’t previously asked that question of the woman who was charged during the first [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) and [convicted in 2021](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/statement-us-attorney-damian-williams-verdict-us-v-ghislaine-maxwell) of conspiring with Epstein to sexually abuse minors. She has a pending [Supreme Court petition](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-ghislaine-maxwell-appeal-epstein-trump-rcna220042) trying to overturn her conviction and 20-year sentence; the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) opposed her petition last week, and the high court has not yet said whether it will consider her appeal.

The orders sending [Blanche](https://www.justice.gov/dag) back to the drawing board on Tuesday came from [U.S. District](https://nysd.uscourts.gov/) [Judge Paul Engelmayer](https://nysd.uscourts.gov/hon-paul-engelmayer), an [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) appointee who’s presiding over the Maxwell docket, and [U.S. District](https://nysd.uscourts.gov/) [Judge Richard Berman](https://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/hon-richard-m-berman), a [Clinton](https://clintonwhitehouse4.archives.gov/) appointee who’s handling the Epstein docket. Both judges are in the [Southern District of New York](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny), where Maxwell and Epstein were charged. The orders are similarly worded; you can read the Maxwell one [here](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.539612/gov.uscourts.nysd.539612.789.0.pdf) and the Epstein one [here](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.518649/gov.uscourts.nysd.518649.63.0.pdf).

Both orders say that the judges intend to resolve the unsealing motions “expeditiously” but that [Blanche](https://www.justice.gov/dag)’s filings were inadequate. The judges gave the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) a week, until July 29, to file a more detailed memorandum making the case for unsealing.

Among other things, the judges said the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) has to say in the memorandum whether it reviewed the grand jury transcripts in question before making the requests and whether victims were notified.

In addition to the government’s memoranda, the judges said filings on the matter are due from Maxwell, Epstein’s representative and victims by Aug. 5.
