## [Following Epstein report, Trump sues the WSJ, Rupert Murdoch and others](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-sues-wsj-murdoch-epstein-birthday-letter-rcna219701)

*On Thursday night, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) vowed to sue [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/). On Friday, a lawsuit was filed in the [Southern District of Florida](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/), according to that court’s docket.*

As the public first learned of [The Wall Street Journal’s report](https://www.wsj.com/politics/trump-jeffrey-epstein-birthday-letter-we-have-certain-things-in-common-f918d796) on [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s alleged 2003 birthday letter [to Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-threatens-wsj-new-epstein-report-picture-claim-looks-sketchy-rcna219545), the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) responded with unsubtle threats. “[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) will be suing [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/), NewsCorp, and Mr. Murdoch, shortly,” [he wrote online](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)/114871422727186590.), referring to himself in the third person for reasons unknown.

The [Republican](https://www.gop.com%) [added soon after](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)/114871752316281496), “[The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/) printed a FAKE letter, supposedly to Epstein. These are not my words, not the way I talk. Also, I don’t draw pictures. I told Rupert Murdoch it was a Scam, that he shouldn’t print this Fake Story. But he did, and now I’m going to sue his ass off, and that of his third rate newspaper.”

It seems he wasn’t kidding. [CNBC reported](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/18/trump-sues-epstein-murdoch-wsj.html):

> *[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) on Friday followed through on his threat to sue media mogul Rupert Murdoch after his [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/) published an article saying that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) sent Jeffrey Epstein a ‘bawdy’ letter for Epstein’s 50th birthday. Court records show that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) filed a lawsuit alleging libel against Murdoch, the [Journal](https://www.wsj.com/)’s publisher, [Dow Jones](https://www.dowjones.com/), and the reporters who wrote the article in federal court for the [Southern District of Florida](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/).*

The civil lawsuit, which was filed in the [Southern District of Florida](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/), comes a day after [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) referred to the [Journal](https://www.wsj.com/) as a [“disgusting and filthy rag.”](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)/114871422727186590) The suit seeks a jury trial and a judgment of at least $10 billion.

The listed defendants are the [Journal](https://www.wsj.com/)’s parent company, [News Corp.](http://newscorp.com/); its publisher, [Dow Jones](https://www.dowjones.com/); the two [Journal](https://www.wsj.com/) reporters who wrote Wednesday’s story; and [News Corp.](http://newscorp.com/) owner Rupert Murdoch and [News Corp.](http://newscorp.com/) CEO Robert Thomson. [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/) said [Dow Jones](https://www.dowjones.com/);, [News Corp.](http://newscorp.com/) and the two reporters did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

In a post on [Liars Club](https://truthsocial.com/) on Friday evening, [Trump wrote](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114876683513144253) in part: “We have just filed a POWERHOUSE Lawsuit against everyone involved in publishing the false, malicious, defamatory, FAKE NEWS ‘article’ in the useless ‘rag’ that is, [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/). ... I hope Rupert and his “friends” are looking forward to the many hours of depositions and testimonies they will have to provide in this case.”

The move has become a familiar one for the incumbent [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), who has, in recent years, [also filed civil lawsuits](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/donald-trumps-lawsuits-against-media-companies-2024-12-20/) [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/), [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/), [The Des Moines Register](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/) and [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/).

It also comes two months after Trump [told a reporter](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-wall-street-journal-reporter-question_n_681857cee4b08041c58c79f1) with the [Journal](https://www.wsj.com/) that he considers the newspaper to be “rotten,” to have “truly gone to hell” and to be “really bad for this country.”

Thursday's report, however, appears to have taken the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)'s contempt for the [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/) to a new level. The [Journal](https://www.wsj.com/) advanced the controversy with a new report on a 2003 birthday album, collected by former Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, which reportedly included a highly provocative letter bearing Trump’s name and signature.

This is a developing story. Check back for updates.
