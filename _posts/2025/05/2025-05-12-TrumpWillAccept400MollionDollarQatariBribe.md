title: "Trump Crime Family: Trump Will Accept $400 Million Bribe (Boeing 747-8 Jumbo Jet) From Qatar, Which Funded Hamas"
---


## [Trump says he’ll accept a \$400m gift from Qatar — which funded Hamas](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-qatar-hamas-antisemitism-boeing-jet-gift-rcna206386)

*The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) attacked universities in the name of "protecting" Jews. But he's happy to receive a donation from [Qatar'](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/)s royal family — which backed [Hamas](https://hamasinfo.info/).*

 May 12, 2025, 7:41 PM EDT

By Anthony L. Fisher, Senior Editor, [MSNBC Daily](https://www.msnbc.com/)

“I could be a stupid person and say no, we don’t want a free plane,” [said the president of the United States](https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/-are-you-kidding-me-why-trump-accepting-luxury-jet-from-qatar-raises-security-questions-239367749859) about the [Boeing](https://www.boeing.com/) [747-8](https://www.boeing.com/commercial/747-8) which [the royal family](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-scrambles-defend-luxury-jet-qatar-ll-use-air-force-one-rcna206207) that rules [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) has offered as a gift.

There are obviously ethical, legal and constitutional issues — to say nothing of security concerns — with [President Donald Trump’s willingness to accept a \$400 million donation](https://www.msnbc.com/chris-jansing-reports/watch/ethics-of-this-is-highly-questionable-reaction-to-trump-defending-offer-of-luxury-jet-from-qatar-239390789997) from a Middle East petrostate with [tens of billions of dollars of business interests](https://usqbc.org/) in the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/). (It’s also more than a bit hypocritical, given that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) leads the party still obsessed with [Hunter Biden’s comparatively low-stakes shady overseas business dealings](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/hunter-biden-s-business-bad-look-here-s-how-fix-n1294057).) [Sen.](https://www.usa.gov/) [Bernie Sanders (I-VT)](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/), put it concisely [in a post on X](https://x.com/BernieSanders/status/1921643208343204053): “Not only is this farcically corrupt, it is blatantly unconstitutional. [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) must not allow this over-the-top kleptocracy to proceed.”

Perhaps less noticed is that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is poised to accept an exorbitant personal gift of a jumbo jet (meant to be used as [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/)) from a government that has provided substantial funding for the antisemitic, fascistic terror group [Hamas](https://hamasinfo.info/) about 100 days after he signed his “[Executive Order to Combat Anti-Semitism](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/additional-measures-to-combat-anti-semitism/).” (For years, [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) funded [Hamas](https://hamasinfo.info/) [with the support of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Israeli government](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-03-26/ty-article/.premium/prime-ministers-office-netanyahu-knew-that-hamas-had-diverted-4m-to-military-wing/00000195-cf86-d104-adfd-ffdf9e100000).)

> *[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is poised to accept an exorbitant personal gift from a government that has provided substantial funding for the antisemitic, fascistic terror group [Hamas](https://hamasinfo.info/).*

At the same time, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) continues to employ Kingsley Wilson as deputy press secretary for the [Department of Defense](https://www.defense.gov/), despite a recent social media record of posts [widely seen as antisemitic](https://www.thebulwark.com/p/shes-just-the-tip-of-the-trump-administration-racist-antisemitic-iceberg-kingsley-wilson-andrew-tate). And since [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) returned to the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), two powerful members of his inner circle have made “[“stiff-armed salutes”](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/steve-bannon-nazi-salute-cpac-rcna193167)” in front of big crowds and many cameras. Yet, the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has used the thinnest of pretexts to characterize activists as antisemitic, before then claiming they’re providing material support to [Hamas](https://hamasinfo.info/).

“To all the resident aliens who joined in the pro-jihadist protests, we put you on notice: come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you,” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said in a [White House fact sheet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-takes-forceful-and-unprecedented-steps-to-combat-anti-semitism/) that accompanied his [January antisemitism executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/additional-measures-to-combat-anti-semitism/). He also promised to “quickly cancel the student visas of all [Hamas](https://hamasinfo.info/) sympathizers on college campuses, which have been infested with radicalism like never before.”

Indeed, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s supposed war on antisemitism is his rationale for his war on universities and campus activism. Meanwhile, [pro-Israel](https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-851431) and [Trump-friendly media outlets](https://www.thefp.com/p/explosion-in-foreign-funding-for-american-universities) have published many articles and op-eds decrying what they say is the nefarious influence of Qatari billions on U.S. universities and [student activist groups](https://www.dailynews.com/2024/04/30/qatari-money-and-the-pro-palestinian-campus-takeovers/). (We’ll have to check back in later to see if they’re equally appalled by [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/)’s lavish funding of an [American president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s air travel.)

The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has tried to justify its deportation proceedings against Mahmoud Khalil, the green-card holder and spouse of a U.S. citizen who served as a mediator and spokesperson for a pro-[Palestinian](https://mofa.pna.ps/)/anti-[Israel](https://www.gov.il/) student activist group encamped last year on the campus of [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/), on the basis of fighting antisemitism. [Secretary](https://www.state.gov/biographies/marco-rubio/) of [State](https://www.state.gov/) [Marco Rubio](https://www.state.gov/biographies/marco-rubio/) later admitted Khalil had broken no laws, and the government has yet to provide any evidence that Khalil spread [Hamas](https://hamasinfo.info/) propaganda or participated in any harassment of [last month a federal judge ruled](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/palestinian-activist-khalil-mahmoud-can-fight-wrongful-detention-case-rcna203654) he can challenge the government’s deportation attempt in court.)

[NBC News reviewed over 100 pages of documents](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/governments-case-mahmoud-khalil-shaky-reliant-tabloid-accounts-review-rcna201254) the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) filed as evidence to back up its deportation efforts for Khalil, and found that “in some instances, the [government](https://www.usa.gov/) appears to be relying on unverified tabloid articles about Khalil. In others, the [government](https://www.usa.gov/)’s claims about him are clearly erroneous because timelines don’t match.”

> *Let’s call [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s so-called war on antisemitism what it is: [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s cudgel to attack his [perceived enemies](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-the-weaponization-of-the-federal-government/).*

In plain English, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s claims that they’re battling antisemitism are absurd. In fact, they are falsely likening protected speech with which they object (such as [co-signing an op-ed](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/12/us/where-things-stand-highest-immigration-cases-trump-hnk) critical of [Israel](https://www.gov.il/)’s conduct in the war in [Gaza](https://mofa.pna.ps/)) to a national security crisis requiring the most severe methods of enforcement, including denials of due process. The [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) is also cloaking its [brazen attempt to shake down universities](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-new-york-city-columbia-hochul-congestion-pricing-rcna197178) and bring them to heel politically by withholding federal funds in the name of “protecting” Jews.

As [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) put in the [antisemitism EO](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/additional-measures-to-combat-anti-semitism/)’s [fact sheet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-takes-forceful-and-unprecedented-steps-to-combat-anti-semitism/), “My promise to Jewish Americans is this: With your vote, I will be your defender, your protector, and I will be the best friend Jewish Americans have ever had in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).”

But in accepting a \$400 million personal gift from [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/), a country that funded the group that gleefully butchered Jews on Oct. 7, 2023, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has made an absolute mockery of his “war on antisemitism.” Let’s call [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s so-called war on antisemitism what it is: Trump’s cudgel to [attack his perceived enemies](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-the-weaponization-of-the-federal-government/).
