## [The Trump administration's big week of gaslighting and censorship](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-free-speech-harvard-marco-rubio-rfk-jr-censorship-rcna209870)

*Over the past few days, members of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s [Cabinet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/) threatened or imposed censorship in at least a half-dozen different ways.*

May 30, 2025, 3:12 PM EDT

By Anthony L. Fisher, Senior Editor, [MSNBC Daily](https://www.msnbc.com/)

[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-attacks-free-speech-columbia-university-rcna197833) has [a well-deserved reputation for gaslighting](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-100-day-mark-relying-heavily-gaslighting-rcna203670) for gaslighting, and several members of his [Cabinet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/) have taken great efforts to continue his willful duplicity. Over the course of the past week alone — in the name of academic, scientific and online “freedom” — [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s bigwigs have [explicitly threatened free speech](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-dhs-harvard-international-student-ban-rcna208776) in at least a half-dozen different ways.

> *Over the course of the past week alone, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s bigwigs have explicitly threatened [free speech](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/) in at least a half-dozen different ways.*

[Health and Human Services](https://www.hhs.gov/) [Secretary](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) [Robert F. Kennedy, Jr](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/rfk-jr-hhs-vaccines-covid-bird-flu-moderna-rcna209745) — who during the 2024 campaign frequently cosplayed as a [free speech](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/) activist and a victim of censorship — said on a podcast Tuesday that he might bar government scientists from publishing in some of the most venerable and respected, peer-reviewed medical journals. “They’re all corrupt,” [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) claimed, citing the fact that they sometimes publish studies that are funded by pharmaceutical companies. [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) also said he’d like to create an in-house publication, a nifty way of controlling what government-employed scientists publish. Already, [Dr. Kevin Hall](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/rfk-jr-censorship-national-institutes-of-health-rcna201881), a nutrition scientist at the [National Institutes of Health](https://www.nih.gov/), resigned last month, [citing censorship of his work](https://x.com/KevinH_PhD/status/1912611967493177674) “because of agency concerns that it did not appear to fully support preconceived narratives of my agency’s leadership about ultra-processed food addiction.”

In an [interview with CNBC on Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/05/28/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-education-secretary-linda-mcmahon.html), [Education](https://www.ed.gov/) [Secretary Linda McMahon](http://www.ed.gov/about/ed-organization/meet-secretary-of-education) was asked about the administration’s intent to cancel all federal grants to [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/) — upwards of \$9 billion in research funding. The secretary’s reply was telling: “Universities should continue to be able to do research as long as they’re abiding by the laws and in sync, I think, with the administration and what the administration is trying to accomplish.”

The [free speech tourists](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-vance-free-speech-phonies-first-amendment-rcna163102) of the [Trump administration](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/free-speech-supreme-court-sullivan-v-new-york-times-wynn-rcna192110) probably know this already — which is why it’s fair to call it gaslighting — but it is not the mission of academic institutions to be “in sync” with any presidential administration. They’re supposed to be bastions of free thought and inquiry, and though many ([especially Harvard](https://www.thefire.org/news/harvard-gets-worst-score-ever-fires-college-free-speech-rankings)) [haven’t kept to those principles](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2016/12/13/13931524/free-speech-pen-america-campus-censorship) in recent decades, it’s hard to fathom how blackmailing colleges into ideological submission could possibly further anyone’s rights to freedom of expression.

Moreover, [McMahon](http://www.ed.gov/about/ed-organization/meet-secretary-of-education)’s justification for sanctions on [Harvard](https://www.harvard.edu/) — that the university violated the [Civil Rights Act of 1964](https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/civil-rights-act) by insufficiently policing antisemitism on its campus — is remarkable insincerity.

For starters, just this week the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) promoted Kingsley Wilson — [who posted multiple antisemitic conspiracy theories](https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-official-who-promoted-antisemitic-conspiracies-appointed-pentagon-press-secretary/) last year — to [Defense Department](https://www.defense.gov/) press secretary. On Thursday, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) announced his nomination of former far-right podcast host [Paul Ingrassia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-ingrassia-22b05810b/) to lead the [U.S. Office of Special Counsel](https://osc.gov/). [Ingrassia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-ingrassia-22b05810b/), [in 2023](https://x.com/PaulIngrassia/status/1801961225833570790), advocated for conservatives to welcome “dissident voices” like antisemitic white nationalist Nick Fuentes [into the larger MAGA movement](https://paulingrassia.substack.com/p/free-nick-fuentes?).

And then there’s the matter of [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [executive order earlier this month](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-equality-of-opportunity-and-meritocracy/) directing the federal government to [stop using a key enforcement mechanism](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/13/nx-s1-5273578/president-trumps-attempts-to-shrink-government-target-civil-rights-efforts) of the [Civil Rights Act of 1964](https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/civil-rights-act).

The [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/business/media/paramount-has-offered-15-million-to-settle-cbs-lawsuit-trump-wants-more-861d857e) Wednesday that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has threatened another lawsuit against [CBS](https://www.cbs.com/) in his brazen attempt to shake down [Paramount Global](https://www.paramount.com/) for millions of dollars to settle a bogus lawsuit over what he erroneously claims was a deceptively edited “60 Minutes” interview with then-[Vice President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Kamala Harris](https://kamalaharris.com/). The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s harassment — and [Paramount](https://www.paramount.com/) controlling shareholder [Shari Redstone](https://www.paramount.com/about/leadership/shari-redstone)’s apparent prioritization of getting federal approval for a business merger over journalistic integrity — have already led to the departures of “60 Minutes” long-time executive producer Bill Owens and [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/) [CEO Wendy McMahon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wendy-mcmahon/). Let’s be very clear: [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is threatening both costly litigation and government retaliation against a news organization over its interview with a political rival. That’s censorship, plain and simple, because the threats themselves have widespread speech-chilling effects.

[Secretary](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcorubio16/) of [State](https://www.state.gov/) [Marco Rubio](https://www.state.gov/biographies/marco-rubio/) on Wednesday offered a particularly bold stroke of [free speech](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/) gaslighting, [announcing in a post on X](https://x.com/SecRubio/status/1927729522855600365) “a new visa restriction policy that will apply to foreign officials and persons who are complicit in censoring Americans.”

> *Rhapsodizing about the glories of [free speech](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/) out of one side of his mouth while threatening draconian censorship out of the other is a long-standing [Trumpian](https://www.gop.com/) tactic.*

Basically, [Secretary Rubio](https://www.state.gov/biographies/marco-rubio/) is [threatening to ban anyone](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/28/marco-rubio-social-media-europe-00372280) who enforces online content moderation laws and policies abroad that affect [U.S. citizens](https://www.usa.gov/). One former [State Department](https://www.state.gov/) official [put a rhetorical question to Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/28/marco-rubio-social-media-europe-00372280), “If there’s an American Nazi posting stuff in [France](https://www.info.gouv.fr/) and [France](https://www.info.gouv.fr/) is like, banning pro-Nazi stuff, is [Rubio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcorubio16/) going to say that the owners of that [French](https://www.info.gouv.fr/) platform doing content moderation are barred from entry to the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/)?” If that weren’t enough [free speech](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/) gaslighting, this is all happening as the [U.S.](https://www.usa.gov/) detains and attempts to expel from the country foreign students for such offenses as writing op-eds critical of [Israel](https://www.gov.il/) for their college newspapers. “Every time I find one of these lunatics I take away their visa,” [Rubio](https://www.state.gov/biographies/marco-rubio/) said in March.

On Wednesday the [State Department](https://www.state.gov/) issued a cable to embassies and consulates advising them to halt student visa interviews “in preparation for an expansion of required social media screening and vetting.” And on Friday, [the department announced](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/30/state-implements-reviews-of-harvard-visa-applicants-social-media-accounts-00375921) it would be starting this program with [Harvard](https://www.harvard.edu/). Even the lack of a public-facing social media presence would be used by the government as evidence against student applicants, as it “may be reflective of evasiveness and call into question the applicant’s credibility.”

Put plainly, the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) is going to scour international students’ social media posts for potential thought crimes against [America](https://www.usa.gov/) — or even a lack thereof — in the name of protecting [American](https://www.usa.gov/) values.

“[Free speech](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/) is essential to the [American](https://www.usa.gov/) way of life — a birthright over which foreign governments have no authority,” [Rubio](https://www.state.gov/biographies/marco-rubio/) posted Wednesday. Rhapsodizing about the glories of [free speech](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/) out of one side of his mouth while threatening draconian censorship out of the other is a long-standing [Trumpian](https://www.gop.com=) tactic. And some of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s most senior deputies this week proved adept at matching their boss’s deception and hypocrisy.
