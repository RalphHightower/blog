## [Is the White House for sale? New reports on Trump‚Äôs crypto ventures raise concern.](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-white-house-for-sale-crypto-rcna205142)

*A UAE-backed investment group and an international trucking logistics firm are pouring millions into cryptocurrencies linked to the president.*

May 6, 2025, 4:40 PM EDT / Updated May 6, 2025, 5:18 PM EDT

By Stephanie Ruhle and Elliot Metz

This is an adapted excerpt from the [May 5](https://www.msnbc.com/11th-hour) episode of ‚ÄúThe 11th Hour with Stephanie Ruhle.‚Äù

Investors appear to be getting a little impatient for some good news on [Donald Trump‚Äô](https://www.msnbc.com/donald-trump)s trade war. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 continued to sink after snapping its nine-day winning streak on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite also finished the day down.

But this news also serves as a reminder to make sure we look at not just what this administration says, but how it operates.

Those losses could be linked to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) opening a new front in his trade war. Seemingly out of nowhere, on Sunday [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) announced on social media that he wants to put tariffs on movies not made in the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/).

‚ÄúThe Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death,‚Äù [Trump wrote on Truth Social.](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114452117143235155). ‚ÄúOther Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States. Hollywood, and many other areas within the [U.S.A.](https://www.usa.gov/), are being devastated. ‚Ä¶ Therefore, I am authorizing the [Department of Commerce](https://www.commerce.gov/), and the [United States Trade Representative](http://www.ustr.gov/), to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands. WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!‚Äù

Still no word from the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) on how placing tariffs on foreign-made movies would even work. However, we have learned that actor and Trump ally [actor and Trump ally Jon Voight](https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/jon-voight-hollywood-plan-donald-trump-tariffs-rcna204968) is directly involved in the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)‚Äôs push to ‚Äúmake Hollywood great again.‚Äù

A 100% tariff on imported movies would do pretty much nothing to ‚Äúbring movies back‚Äù to [America](https://www.usa.gov/). What it does do is welcome retaliation, and if other countries impose the same tariff on the U.S. film industry, Hollywood will lose a lot of money and a lot of jobs.

But this news also serves as a reminder to look at not just what this administration says, but how it operates.

This deal would be a massive windfall for [World Liberty Financial](https://www.worldlibertyfinanal.com/), which, as [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) has reported, is largely owned by a Trump family corporate entity.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs proposal to slap tariffs on foreign films has dominated headlines, joined by outrage over an [AI image of Trump as pope](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-ai-pope-image-truth-social-backlash-rcna205068) and his grand ideas for [rebuilding Alcatraz.](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-alcatraz-reopen-prison-rcna204889). But it‚Äôs important to also look at the stories [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has not been talking about.

Last week, a [United Arab Emirates](https://) state-backed investment firm put $2 billion in one of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs cryptocurrencies. The deal was announced onstage at a cryptocurrency convention in Dubai by [Zach Witkoff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zachary-witkoff-038a4143/), a co-founder of the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) family crypto venture, [World Liberty Financial](https://www.worldlibertyfinanal.com/), and son of the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)‚Äôs envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff. Also on stage at the time of that announcement: [Eric Trump](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erictrump/).

This deal would be a massive windfall for [World Liberty Financial](https://www.worldlibertyfinanal.com/), which, [as The New York Times has reported,](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/us/politics/trump-crypto-world-liberty-financial.html), is largely owned by a [Trump family corporate entity](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).

On the same day as that announcement, [Bloomberg News,](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-01/us-weighs-easing-nvidia-chip-curbs-on-uae-as-trump-plans-visit) citing people familiar with the matter, reported the [U.S.](https://www.usa.gov/) is considering relaxing restrictions on [Nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/)‚Äôs chip sales to the [United Arab Emirates](https://u.ae/). This would be a huge win for the [UAE](https://u.ae/), as its progress on artificial intelligence has been limited due to the Biden administration‚Äôs rules on chips. All of this comes as [Trump is set to visit the country as part of his Middle East trip](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/22/trump-middle-east-trip-00303616) next week.

But that‚Äôs not all. There‚Äôs another story involving [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs crypto ventures that might have missed your radar. An international trucking logistics firm just announced it plans [to buy $20 million of Trump‚Äôs crypto coins.](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-coins-freight-influence_n_68153967e4b03d516aad99d3) Now maybe they‚Äôre not trying to buy influence on trade policy, but why exactly would a trucking company roll the dice on a meme coin that just happens to benefit the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)?

It‚Äôs reports like these that have us asking: Is this [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) for sale?
