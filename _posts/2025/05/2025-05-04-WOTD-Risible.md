[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and [his cabinet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/) and [administration](https;//www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) are the largest grouping of incompetence. 

Every day, hour, minute, second, [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump) provides fodder for [Saturday Night Live - NBC.com](https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live).

## [Merriam-Webster's Word of the Day for May 4 is "risible":](http://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day/2025/05/04/)

## What It Means

Risible is a formal word used disapprovingly to describe things that deserve to be mocked or laughed at because they are absurd or unreasonable.

// Although the teachers derided the students’ slang as risible nonsense, the same had been said about their own generation’s lingo.

## Examples

"Smartwatches and smartphones are banned in my children’s schools during the school day, which I’m very happy about; I find any argument for allowing these devices in the classroom to be risible." — Jessica Grose, The New York Times, 27 Mar. 2024

### Did you know?

Say “cheese”! Now say thank you to the risorius muscles near the corners of your mouth for helping you smile. You might find this exercise a bit ridiculous—risible, even—but we’re here to explain that there is no need for derision; it’s for a wordy reason. Risible, ridiculous, derision, and risorius all come from the Latin verb ridēre, meaning “to laugh.” This etymology helps make the meaning of risible clear; something is described as risible (such as saying “cheese” out loud to yourself while looking at your phone/computer) when it arouses or provokes laughter. But just as its synonym laughable often describes things deserving not just of laughter but of eye-rolling scorn, risible is frequently applied to that which merits both sneer and chortle, scoff and guffaw. Words are funny like that.
