Hi, my name is Ralph Hightower, and I’m a constituent from Chapin, South Carolina. I’d like to express my concern about the ongoing threats to free speech and ask [Wilson | Scott | Graham]'s stance.

While Trump issued an executive order claiming to restore free speech, we’re seeing the opposite—suppression, investigations, and intimidation.

Student Detention & Deportation: Security footage suggests a foreign student was forcibly taken off the streets—this looks more like a kidnapping than lawful enforcement.

Targeting Political Dissent: The administration is investigating Bruce Springsteen for his tour comments criticizing authoritarianism.

Weaponizing Federal Agencies: The Secret Service is pursuing James Comey over an Instagram post featuring an artwork with "86 47", despite Merriam-Webster defining "86" as unrelated to violence.

Can you confirm if [Wilson | Scott | Graham] has taken any action to protect free speech rights? Will they publicly reaffirm their commitment?
