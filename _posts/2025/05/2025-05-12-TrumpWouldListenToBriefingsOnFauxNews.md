title: "Trump’s Presidential Daily Briefings Doesn’t Include Crayons To Keep His Interest"
---

If [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) read the presidential daily briefings, then he'd pay attention.

With [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) ignoring the daily presidential briefings, America is vulnerable to attacks with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s pants down at his ank.

## [Trump reportedly shrugs off intelligence briefings he needs, but doesn’t want](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-reportedly-shrugs-intelligence-briefings-needs-doesnt-want-rcna206248)

*In his first term, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) blew off intelligence briefings that he needed to govern. The problem is even worse in his [second term](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).*

Among the many problems with [Kash Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s [embarrassing tenure](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/hint-independence-fbis-kash-patel-falls-back-line-trumps-agenda-rcna205865) as [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director is his willful ignorance. [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/kash-patels-new-way-leading-fbi-fewer-morning-intel-briefings-sports-e-rcna202865) last week that while [FBI](https://.fbi.gov/) [directors](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) have, for decades, attended a daily 8:30 a.m. “director’s brief,” but [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) is receiving these briefings only twice a week — in part because he kept failing to show up for work on time. He has also apparently abandoned a Wednesday afternoon teleconference meeting with bureau leaders in field offices.

Two current [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) officials told [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/) that [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s intelligence briefers have struggled to craft a briefing “[that captures his attention](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/kash-patels-new-way-leading-fbi-fewer-morning-intel-briefings-sports-e-rcna202865).”

This is not, evidently, limited to the hapless [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [chief](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel). [Politico reported](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/09/trump-intelligence-briefing-frequency-00338946):

> *Since [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was sworn into office in January, he has sat for just 12 presentations from intelligence officials of the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s Daily Brief. That’s a significant drop compared with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [first term in office](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/), according to a [POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/) analysis of his public schedule. In much of his [first term](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) met with intel officials twice a week for the briefing, which provides the intelligence community’s summary of the most pressing national security challenges facing the nation.*

[Politico](https://www.politico.com/)’s report, which has not been independently verified by [MSNBC](https;//www.msnbc.com/) or [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/), added that the low number of briefings “is troubling to many in and around the intelligence community, who were already concerned about [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s act-first-evaluate-after approach to governing.”

It’s worth emphasizing that different [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)s have approached these briefings in different ways. [George W. Bush](https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/president/) received intelligence briefings on a nearly daily basis. [Barack Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) received briefings roughly every other day, but he was known to be a voracious reader of the written [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s Daily Brief (often referred to as the PDB). [Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) received an in-person briefing once or twice a week, but like [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/), he was also known to read the PDB briefing book.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), meanwhile, [reportedly doesn’t read the PDB](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/breaking-with-tradition-trump-skips-[president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)s-written-intelligence-report-for-oral-briefings/2018/02/09/b7ba569e-0c52-11e8-95a5-c396801049ef_story.html), and if the [Politico](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) report is accurate, he’s receiving in-person briefings roughly once every 10 days.

Broadly speaking, a couple of angles are worth keeping in mind in response to reporting like this. The first is probably obvious: [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is dealing with serious national security challenges — war in [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/), a crisis in the Middle East, [China](https://www.gov.cn/) expanding its global influence, domestic security threats, et al. — and the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) is being led by an incurious former television personality who desperately needs — but apparently isn’t getting — valuable information that would lead to better decision-making.

Less obvious, however, is the pattern: The problem isn’t just that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is avoiding intelligence he needs; the problem is made worse by the fact that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has always avoided intelligence he needs.

During his transition process in 2016, for example, [skipped nearly all of his intelligence briefings](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-skips-intel-briefings-questions-intensify). Asked why, the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) told [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) in December 2016, “Well, I get it when I need it. ... I don’t have to be told — you know, I’m, like, a smart person.”

@RalphHightower: [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) isn't a smart person. He bankrupted his business six times, lost two casinos, and an airline. He's a fucking idiot!

As his inauguration drew closer, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) acknowledged that he likes very short intelligence briefings. “I like bullets, or I like as little as possible,” he [explained](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/intelligence-briefings-trump-prefers-little-possible) in January 2017. Around the same time, he [added](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/04/28/trumps-allergy-intelligence-details-come-into-full-focus-coronavirus-response/), “I don’t need, you know, 200-page reports on something that can be handled on a page.”

Things did not improve once he was in power. In early 2017, intelligence professionals went to great lengths to try to accommodate the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s toddler-like attention span, preparing reports “[with lots of graphics and maps](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/12/us/politics/national-security-council-turmoil.html).” [National Security Council](https://www.whitehouse.gov/nsc/) officials eventually learned that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was likely to stop reading important materials unless he saw his own name, so they [included his name](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/national-security-officials-try-accommodate-trumps-attributes) in “as many paragraphs” as possible.

@RalphHightower: If Crayons were included with his PDB, maybe he'd pay a little bit more attention.

In August 2017, The [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) had [a piece](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/the-fight-over-trumps-afghan-policy-has-become-an-argument-over-the-meaning-of-america-first/2017/08/04/f2790c80-785f-11e7-8f39-eeb7d3a2d304_story.html) on then-[White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster, who struggled to “hold the attention of the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)” during briefings on [Afghanistan](https://moi.gov.af/). The [article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/the-fight-over-trumps-afghan-policy-has-become-an-argument-over-the-meaning-of-america-first/2017/08/04/f2790c80-785f-11e7-8f39-eeb7d3a2d304_story.html) noted, “[E]ven a single page of bullet points on the country seemed to tax the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s attention span on the subject.”

A [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) confidant [said](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/the-fight-over-trumps-afghan-policy-has-become-an-argument-over-the-meaning-of-america-first/2017/08/04/f2790c80-785f-11e7-8f39-eeb7d3a2d304_story.html) at the time, “I call the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) the two-minute man. The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has patience for a half-page.”

In February 2018, the [Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) reported that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) “[rarely, if ever](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/breaking-with-tradition-trump-skips-[president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)s-written-intelligence-report-for-oral-briefings/2018/02/09/b7ba569e-0c52-11e8-95a5-c396801049ef_story.html)” read the PDB prepared for him. Months later, the [Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) had [a separate report](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/gap-continues-to-widen-between-trump-and-intelligence-community-on-key-issues/2018/12/11/23a02cb0-f8db-11e8-863c-9e2f864d47e7_story.html) noting that the [CIA](https://www.cia.gov/) and other agencies devoted enormous “time, energy and resources” to ensuring that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) received key intelligence, but “his seeming imperviousness to such material often renders ‘all of that a waste.’”

In early 2020, the [Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) [reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/[president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)s-intelligence-briefing-book-repeatedly-cited-virus-threat/2020/04/27/ca66949a-8885-11ea-ac8a-fe9b8088e101_story.html) that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) missed the early alarms on the Covid threat, in part because he “routinely skips reading the PDB” and had “little patience” for oral summaries of the intelligence. Exactly five years ago next week, The [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) had [a related report](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/us/politics/[president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)s-daily-brief-trump.html):

> *The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) veers off on tangents and getting him back on topic is difficult, they said. He has a short attention span and rarely, if ever, reads intelligence reports, relying instead on conservative media and his friends for information. He is unashamed to interrupt intelligence officers and riff based on tips or gossip. ... Mr. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) rarely absorbs information that he disagrees with or that runs counter to his worldview, the officials said. Briefing him has been so great a challenge compared with his predecessors that the intelligence agencies have hired outside consultants to study how better to present information to him.*

It was an extraordinary revelation to consider: A sitting American [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), in a time of multiple and dangerous crises, was so resistant to learning about security threats that his own country’s intelligence officials have sought outside help to figure out how to get him to listen and focus.

Or, put another way, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s indifference to intelligence is a problem, but it’s not a new problem.
