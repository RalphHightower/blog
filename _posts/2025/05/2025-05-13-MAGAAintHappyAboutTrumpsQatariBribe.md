*[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s plan to accept a luxury jet as a gift from the [Qatari](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) royal family has led to broad criticism — including from the MAGA faithful.*

May 13, 2025, 11:39 AM EDT / Updated May 13, 2025, 1:18 PM EDT

By [Clarissa-Jan Lim](https://www.msnbc.com/author/clarissa-jan-lim-ncpn1307846)

[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s plan to [accept a luxury jet from the Qatari royal family](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/qatar-trump-jet-gift-plane-corrupt-newsletter-rcna206330) has led to an uproar among ethics experts, [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) and [even some Republicans](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-struggles-defend-qatars-luxury-jet-gift-republicans-are-divided-rcna206447). But some of the loudest criticism has come from his most fervent MAGA supporters.

On his podcast Monday, The Daily Wire co-founder Ben Shapiro [pointed to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYBuphYtp6I&t=1907s) [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/)’s relationship with the [Muslim Brotherhood](https://www.ikhwanonline.com/article/) and [Hamas](https://hamasinfo.info/), saying that accepting a gift from the royal family is “not America First.”

If you want [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to succeed, this kind of skeezy stuff needs to stop.

“Is this good for [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), is it good for his agenda? Is it good for draining the swamp and getting things done? The answer is no, it isn’t,” Shapiro said. “It isn’t. If you want [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to succeed, this kind of skeezy stuff needs to stop.”

He added: “I think if we switched the names to Hunter Biden and [Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/), we’d all be freaking out on the right.”

Far-right influencer [Laura Loomer](https://www.loomered.com/), who has had [direct access to Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/way-too-early/watch/firing-of-nsa-chief-raises-concerns-about-laura-loomer-s-influence-236691013909), wrote a series of posts criticizing the gift.

“I love [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). I would take a bullet for him,” she [wrote on X](https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/1921615017138618439) on Sunday. “But, I have to call a spade a spade. We cannot accept a \$400 million ‘gift’ from jihadists in suits.”

[Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) host [Mark Levin](https://www.foxnews.com/person/l/mark-levin) shared [Loomer](https://www.loomered.com/)’s post, [adding](https://x.com/marklevinshow/status/1921701015516057967): “Ditto.”

[Loomer](https://www.loomered.com/), however, also tempered some of her criticism with effusive praise for the president. “It will be a stain, but he is still the best [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) of my lifetime,” she [wrote on X](https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/1921987426131837358) on Monday.

First [reported by ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-administration-poised-accept-palace-sky-gift-trump/story?id=121680511), the super luxury [Boeing](https://www.boeing.com/) [747-8 jumbo jet](https://www.boeing.com/commercial/747-8) — which is estimated to be valued at \$400 million — from Qatar is expected to be converted for use as Air Force One. The overhaul would take years and a potentially hefty price tag, along with a host of security concerns, according to aviation and intelligence experts who [spoke with NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/america-first-trump-qatar-luxury-jet-air-force-one-rcna206254).

Meanwhile, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has defended his decision to accept the plane, calling it “a great gesture from [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/)” and suggesting it was too good an offer to pass up on.

[“I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer,” he said Monday when pressed about the deal. “I mean, I could be a stupid person [and] say, ‘No, we don’t want a free, very expensive](airplane.’”)
