title: "Trump Crime Family: Trump Accepts Qatari Jet Bribe Despite Illegality and Bipartisan Resistance"
---


This [Qatari](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) is a Trojan Horse. The [Boeing](https://www.boeing.com/) [747-8](https://www.boeing.com/commercial/747-8) would have to be stripped down to the airframe to make sure that there are no listening devices or tracking devices embedded in [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s gift. Plus the airframe and electronics have to be hardened to be able to withstand an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) generated by a nuclear blast.

- How long would that take?
- How much would it cost?

*[Team Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s decision to accept the [Qatari](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) “gift” doesn’t end the controversy; it starts the controversy.*

May 21, 2025, 2:12 PM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

When the news broke last week that [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [poised to accept](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-scrambles-defend-luxury-jet-qatar-ll-use-air-force-one-rcna206207) a superluxury [Boeing](https://www.boeing.com/) [747-8 jumbo jet](https://www.boeing.com/commercial/747-8) from the [royal family of Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/), some of the relevant players made clear that the plans had not yet been finalized. In fact, a spokesperson for [Qatar’s government](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) referred to the “possible transfer” of the aircraft, adding that “no decision has been made.”

A week later, however, it’s apparently a done deal. [The New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/21/us/politics/qatar-plane-trump-air-force-one.html):

> *The [United States](https //www.usa.gov/) has accepted a [747](https://www.boeing.com/commercial/747-8) jetliner as a gift from the [government of Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/), and the [Air Force](https://www.af.mil/) has now been asked to figure out a way to rapidly upgrade it so it can be put into use as a new [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/) for [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), a [Defense Department](https://www.defense.gov=) spokesman confirmed Wednesday.*

Sean Parnell, the chief [Pentagon](https://www.jcs.mil/) spokesman, said in a statement, “The [secretary](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) of [defense](https://www.defense.gov/) has accepted a [Boeing](https://www.boeing.com/) [747](https://www.boeing.com/commercial/747-8) from [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) in accordance with all federal rules and regulations. The [Department of Defense](https://www.defense.gov/) will work to ensure proper security measures and functional-mission requirements are considered for an aircraft used to transport the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) of the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/).”

[The Times](https://www.nytimes.com/)’ report added that the [Defense Department](https://www.defense.gov/) “has not given an estimate of when the work on the [Qatari](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) plane might be done, even though [Mr. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) have made clear the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov=) wants it soon, perhaps even by the end of the year.”

What the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov=) “wants” is likely to prove irrelevant: [NBC News recently reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/turning-qatari-747-air-force-one-cost-1-billion-take-years-experts-say-rcna206582) that converting the luxury jet will “take years to complete.”

Indeed, it’s worth emphasizing that the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s decision to accept the [Qatari](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) “gift” doesn’t end the controversy; it starts the controversy.

Now that this plan is moving forward, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and his [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) team should prepare for a series of questions for which there are no easy answers. Where will [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [find the money to pay for](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/problems-trumps-free-luxury-jet-qatar-s-not-actually-free-rcna206706) for this “free” plane? Why does he [keep pretending](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114526479593964662) that this “gift” isn’t for him personally, [even after he’s publicly suggested otherwise](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3lp3u4rx5pu27)? How does [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) intend to overcome the seemingly obvious fact that the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/)’s [Emoluments Clause](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S1-C7-1/ALDE_00000233/) still exists, and it appears to prohibit exactly this kind of arrangement?

Why was [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) [involved in approving this process](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-qatar-jet-pam-bondi-conflict-rcna206997) after having served as a paid registered lobbyist for [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/)? How does [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) plan to explain away his [earlier condemnations](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/13/trump-plane-qatar-comments/) of [presidents](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) accepting foreign gifts? Why is the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) apparently indifferent to the fact that even many of his [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) allies [have expressed opposition](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/republicans-raise-concerns-over-trumps-plane-gift-as-he-heads-to-qatar-0060bdec) to this idea? Will [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) have any role in approving the transfer, as is required for such gestures of international generosity?

As for the gambit’s many [Democratic critics](https://www.democrats.org/), the [congressional minority](https://www.congress.gov/) can’t hold hearings or send subpoenas, but a group of [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) last week [formally requested](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2025/05/14/dems-demand-military-investigation-into-qatars-plane-gift-to-trump/) that the [Pentagon](https://www.jcs.mil/)’s [inspector general](https://www.jcs.mil/About/Joint-Staff-Inspector-General/)’s office open an investigation into the matter, which might actually happen, and there's [a related effort](https://www.schiff.senate.gov/news/press-releases/watch-sen-schiff-reacts-to-trumps-corrupt-self-enriching-qatar-plane-gift-on-msnbcs-the-briefing-with-jen-psaki/) to press the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/)'s [inspector general](https://oig.justice.gov/)'s office to begin scrutiny, too.

This story, in other words, is just getting started. Watch this space.
