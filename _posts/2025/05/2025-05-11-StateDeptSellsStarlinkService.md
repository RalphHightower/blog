## [Trump’s State Department hawks Elon Musk’s Starlink internet service amid tariff talks](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/elon-musk-starlink-state-department-marco-rubio-tariffs-rcna205678)

*A new report shows how the the [Rubio](https://www.state.gov/biographies/marco-rubio/)-led agency has been focused on promoting the [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/) [owner](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)’s business interests abroad.*

May 8, 2025, 6:11 PM EDT
By [Ja'han Jones](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jahan-jones-ncpn371241)

Under [Secretary of State](https://www.state.gov/) [Marco Rubio](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-michael-waltz-out-consolidate-power-rcna204474)’s leadership, the [State Department](https://www.state.gov/) appears to have become a tool to serve [Elon Musk](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/elon-musk-doge-lawsuit-omb-trump-rcna203829)’s business interests.

[Rubio](https://www.state.gov/biographies/marco-rubio/) has overseen the [dismantling of the](https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/03/10/g-s1-52964/rubio-announces-that-83-of-usaid-contracts-will-be-canceled) [U.S. Agency for International Development](https://apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/u-s-agency-for-international-development?sconvid=40621) and the [closure of an office that’s been crucial to the fight against foreign disinformation](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/trump-rubio-state-department-foreign-disinformation.html), which is to say: He has taken a sledgehammer to some of the department’s crucial missions worldwide.

Meanwhile, a new report [from The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/05/07/elon-musk-starlink-trump-tariffs/) suggests his [State Department](https://www.state.gov/) has launched a new project of sorts: getting foreign nations — particularly, nations who may want to curry favor with the U.S. amid [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s destructive tariff war — to adopt [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)’s [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/) internet service.

[The Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) obtained an internal [State Department](https://www.state.gov/) memo suggesting that the country of [Lesotho](https://www.gov.ls/), which [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [mocked at this year’s joint address to Congress](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/05/nx-s1-5318757/lesotho-africa-trump) by saying no one has ever heard of it, was hoping that its [recent Starlink deal](https://lca.org.ls/public-announcement-licensing-of-the-first-satellite-internet-service-in-lesotho/) would lead to tariff relief.

[The Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) quotes the memo as saying:

> *As the government of [Lesotho](https://www.gov.ls/) negotiates a trade deal with the United States, it hopes that licensing [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/) demonstrates goodwill and intent to welcome U.S. businesses.*

The report says [Lesotho](https://www.gov.ls/) is one of several countries that have granted [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/) access while trying to navigate [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s tariffs. And it details how the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has pushed for nations to reach such deals amid the tariff talks, though they haven’t demanded it. [According to the Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/05/07/elon-musk-starlink-trump-tariffs/):

> *"A series of internal government messages obtained by [The Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) reveal how U.S. embassies and the [State Department](https://www.state.gov/) have pushed nations to clear hurdles for U.S. satellite companies, often mentioning [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/) by name. The documents do not show that the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) team has explicitly demanded favors for [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/) in exchange for lower tariffs. But they do indicate that [Secretary](https://www.state.gov/biographies/marco-rubio/) of [State](https://www.state.gov/) [Marco Rubio](https://www.state.gov/biographies/marco-rubio/) has increasingly instructed officials to push for regulatory approvals for [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)’s [satellite firm](https://www.starlink.com/) at a moment when the White House is calling for wide-ranging talks on trade."*

It’s easy to see how other nations might conclude that reaching agreements to do business with a company run by [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk), the president’s top campaign donor in 2024, might earn them some tariff relief. And for the record, the [State Department](https://www.state.gov/) didn’t even deny that it’s hawking [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)’s service, telling the [Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/):

[Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/) is an American-made product that has been game-changing in helping remote areas around the world gain internet connectivity. Any patriotic American should want to see an American company’s success on the global stage, especially over compromised [Chinese](https://www.gov.cn/) competitors.

No acknowledgment there of the obvious conflict of interest in this case.

It would be one thing if [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/) were simply the best internet service available, but I’ve [written about the federal government’s previous determinations about Starlink’s shortcomings](https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/elon-musk-starlink-house-investigation-hurricane-helene-rcna174593), so the fact that the [State Department](https://www.state.gov/) seems to have a specific interest in promoting the service to foreign nations feels like a favor to [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) over all else.

Keep in mind: This is all being carried out by the same conservative movement that [accused Hunter Biden of unethically using his father’s name to prop up his art business](https://news.artnet.com/art-world-archives/republican-congressman-hunter-biden-art-sales-1993323). The same [Republican Party](https://www.gop.com/) that portrayed itself as a defender of free market capitalism as it complained about the Obama [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) [picking winners and losers](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/gop-struggles-push-back-against-obama-climate-agenda-flna6c10464765) in certain industries.

This movement is now led by someone who [turned the White House lawn into a showroom](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-turns-white-house-lawn-car-lot-megadonor-musk-rcna196000) to promote [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)’s [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) company, whose [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) is [quickly implementing Starlink across federal agencies](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/elon-musk/elon-musk-starlink-growing-footprint-federal-government-rcna195400), and whose [State Department](https://www.state.gov/) is urging foreign countries to adopt the service, as well.

[Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) seem to know how unethical this all is, even if they won’t admit it. Last month, I [wrote about Republicans changing House rules](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/house-republicans-rule-block-resolutions-of-inquiry-rcna203905) rules to prevent [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) from forcing votes on whether to investigate various [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) scandals — including [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)’s conflicts of interests.

It looks like [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) would rather turn a blind eye to this obvious issue.
