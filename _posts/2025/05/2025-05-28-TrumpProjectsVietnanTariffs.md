By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

In mid-April, as much of the world struggled to come to terms with [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs trade war, [The Wall Street Journal reported](https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/anxious-trading-partners-promise-to-buy-american-to-stave-off-trumps-tariffs-784ed405?st=hAfSkc&) on a variety of strategies that countries were exploring to stave off the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)‚Äôs tariffs. The article noted in passing that [Vietnam](https://vietnam.gov.vn/), in particular, was so concerned about potential economic punishment that the country ‚Äúaccelerated the approvals for a \$1.5 billion [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) resort.‚Äù

That one partial sentence in the sixth paragraph of a longer article stood out in large part because of its implications: If the [Journal](https://www.wsj.com/) was correct, it suggested that at least some officials abroad were working from the assumption that the [American](https://www.usa.gov/) [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is corrupt and that doing favors for his family business would translate into favorable treatment from his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/).

A month later, [The New York Times published](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/25/world/asia/trump-vietnam-golf-project.html) a detailed examination of [Vietnam](https://vietnam.gov.vn/)‚Äôs efforts, which went further than the [Journal](https://www.wsj.com/)‚Äôs report even suggested.

> *To fast-track the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) development, [Vietnam](https://vietnam.gov.vn/) has ignored its own laws, legal experts said, granting concessions more generous than what even the most connected locals receive. [Vietnamese](https://vietnam.gov.vn/)officials, in a letter obtained by [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/), explicitly stated that the project required special support from the top ranks of the [Vietnamese](https://vietnam.gov.vn/) government because it was ‚Äòreceiving special attention from the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) and [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) personally.‚Äô*

There‚Äôs nothing subtle about any of this. As the [Times](https://www.nytimes.com/)‚Äô report, which has not been independently verified by [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com=) or [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/), went on to explain, [Vietnamese](https://vietnam.gov.vn/) officials are under intense pressure to reach a trade agreement with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to avoid economically costly tariffs. Simultaneously, [Vietnamese](https://vietnam.gov.vn/) officials are also scrambling to approve projects sought by [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs [family business](https://www.trump.com/) ‚Äî an entity the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) personally profits from.

The policy process, in other words, appears to have been warped by corrupt considerations.

In an official statement to the [Times](https://www.nytimes.com/), the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) said, ‚ÄúAll of the president‚Äôs trade discussions are totally unrelated to the [Trump Organization](https://www.trump.com/).‚Äù And while officials might even believe that, the article went on to note that ‚Äúas the deal-making accelerates and collides with [U.S.](https://www.usa.gov/) threats to free trade, the line between [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) the [tycoon](https://www.trump.com/) is now seen by diplomats, trade officials and corporations worldwide as so obviously blurred that governments feel more compelled than ever to favor anything [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-related.‚Äù

[Vietnam](https://vietnam.gov.vn/)‚Äôs government, the [Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) added, ‚Äúsees [Mr. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) and the [Trump Organization](https://www.trump.com/) as one.‚Äù


What‚Äôs more, there‚Äôs no reason to see [Vietnam](https://vietnam.gov.vn/)‚Äôs fast-track approval for the [Trump Organization‚Äôs](https://www.trump.com/) \$1.5 billion golf community in isolation: [Reuters reported](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/vietnam-government-document-says-trump-organization-exploring-tower-ho-chi-minh-2025-05-19/) last week on the [American](https://www.usa.gov/) [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)‚Äôs [family business](https://www.trump.com/) and a local partner in [Vietnam](https://vietnam.gov.vn/) also ‚Äúexploring plans to build a skyscraper in [Vietnam](https://vietnam.gov.vn/)‚Äôs business hub of [Ho Chi Minh City](https://baochinhphu.vn/ho-chi-minh-city.html).‚Äù It led [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/)‚Äôs [Dana Milbank](https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/dana-milbank/) to [describe the developments](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/05/23/dana-milbank-trump-south-africa-usaid/) as part of ‚Äúa transparent attempt to buy [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs favor while it tries to persuade him to drop tariffs he imposed against the country.‚Äù

Whether the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) will play its part in this scheme and show [Vietnam](https://vietnam.gov.vn/) favorable treatment remains to be seen. Watch this space.
