## [Federal Reserve Board - Federal Reserve issues FOMC statement](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20250507a.htm)

May 07, 2025

For release at 2:00 p.m. EDT

Although swings in net exports have affected the data, recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. The unemployment rate has stabilized at a low level in recent months, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated.

The [Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased further. The [Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen.

In support of its goals, the [Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the [Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The [Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) will continue reducing its holdings of [Treasury securities](https://home.treasury.gov/services/bonds-and-securities) and agency debt and [agency mortgage‑backed securities](https://home.treasury.gov/services/bonds-and-securities). The [Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.

In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the [Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The [Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the [Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm)'s goals. The [Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm)'s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.

Voting for the monetary policy action were [Jerome H. Powell, Chair](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm); [John C. Williams, Vice Chair](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/federal-reserve-system-new-york.htm); [Michael S. Barr](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/barr.htm); [Michelle W. Bowman](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/bowman.htm); [Susan M. Collins](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/federal-reserve-system-boston.htm); [Lisa D. Cook](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/cook.htm); [Austan D. Goolsbee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/federal-reserve-system-chicago.htm); [Philip N. Jefferson](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/jefferson.htm); [Neel Kashkari](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/federal-reserve-system-minneapolis.htm); [Adriana D. Kugler](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/kugler.htm); [Alberto G. Musalem](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/federal-reserve-system-st-louis.htm); and [Christopher J. Waller](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/waller.htm).

Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation

The [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy stance announced by the [Federal Open Market Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) in its statement on May 7, 2025:

The [Board of Governors](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/default.htm) of the [Federal Reserve System](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) voted unanimously to maintain the interest rate paid on reserve balances at 4.4 percent, effective May 8, 2025.

As part of its policy decision, the [Federal Open Market Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) voted to direct the Open Market Desk at the [Federal Reserve Bank of New York](https://www.newyorkfed.org/), until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:

"Effective May 8, 2025, the [Federal Open Market Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) directs the Desk to:

Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 4-1/4 to 4‑1/2 percent.

Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 4.5 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion.

Conduct standing overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 4.25 percent and with a per‑counterparty limit of $160 billion per day.

Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/)'s holdings of [Treasury securities](https://home.treasury.gov/services/bonds-and-securities) maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $5 billion per month. Redeem [Treasury coupon securities](https://home.treasury.gov/services/bonds-and-securities) up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap.

Reinvest the amount of principal payments from the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/)'s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities (MBS) received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month into [Treasury securities](https://home.treasury.gov/services/bonds-and-securities) to roughly match the maturity composition of [Treasury securities](https://home.treasury.gov/services/bonds-and-securities) outstanding.

Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons."

In a related action, the [Board of Governors](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/default.htm) of the [Federal Reserve System](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) voted unanimously to approve the establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 4.5 percent.

This information will be updated as appropriate to reflect decisions of the [Federal Open Market Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) or the [Board of Governors](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/default.htm) regarding details of the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/)'s operational tools and approach used to implement monetary policy.
