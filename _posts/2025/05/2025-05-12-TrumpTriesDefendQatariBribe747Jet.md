## [Trump scrambles to defend luxury jet from Qatar he’ll use as Air Force One](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-scrambles-defend-luxury-jet-qatar-ll-use-air-force-one-rcna206207)

*The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) tried to defend an apparent plan in which he’d get to use a luxury jet from the government of [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/). It didn’t go well.*

 May 12, 2025, 8:00 AM EDT

By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

In [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [first term](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/), the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) cultivated an unexpectedly amusing list of incidents related to airplanes. I actually [maintained a list](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-takes-aim-the-complexity-modern-airplanes-msna1203801), documenting a curious array of stories in which the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [suggested that F-35s are literally invisible](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-genuinely-seems-believe-f-35s-are-literally-invisible-n1131361), whined about [the complexity of piloting](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-takes-aim-the-complexity-modern-airplanes-msna1203801), referenced F-52s [that didn’t exist](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-boasts-about-norway-buying-fighter-jets-dont-exist) outside of video games, [complained to members of Congress](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trumps-preoccupation-airplanes-seems-little-weird) that the [emir](https://www.da.gov.kw/) of [Kuwait](https://www.cmgs.gov.kw/)’s plane was bigger than his, and ([among other things](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-takes-aim-the-complexity-modern-airplanes-msna1203801)) got caught [lying about Japan](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-touts-another-airplane-deal-doesnt-exist) buying U.S. fighter jets and [lying about Finland](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-says-finland-buying-us-fighter-jets-finland-disagrees) doing the same thing.

In his [second term](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), the news at the intersection of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and planes is far less funny. [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-administration-will-accept-luxury-jet-qatar-use-air-force-one-rcna206111):

> *The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) is preparing to accept a superluxury [Boeing](https://www.boeing.com/) [747-8](https://www.boeing.com/commercial/747-8) jumbo jet from the royal family of [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) as a gift to be used by [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) as the new [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/) for presidential travel until shortly before [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) leaves office, according to four sources familiar with the planning. Two of the sources also confirm that ownership of the plane will be transferred to the [Trump presidential library](http://www.trumplibrary.gov/) foundation once the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) ends his second term.*

According to [a report from ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-administration-poised-accept-palace-sky-gift-trump/story?id=121680511), which was the first to break this story, [Attorney General](www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) and other [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) lawyers determined that the acceptance of the plane was legally permissible if the [Qatari](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) government gifts it to the [Defense Department](https://www.defense.gov) and it is later turned over to the [Trump Library Foundation](http://www.trumplibrary.gov/).

This is notable for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is the [attorney general](https://www.justice.gov/)’s recent professional background: [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) used to work as a registered lobbyist for foreign clients, [including the government of Qatar](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/pam-bondi-tapped-trump-ag-still-haunted-controversies-rcna181609) — the same government that’s apparently preparing to reward [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) with a jet. (Soon after [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) made her the nation’s chief law enforcement official, [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) [also disbanded the FBI’s Foreign Influence Task Force](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/ag-pam-bondi-shutters-fbis-foreign-influence-task-force-rcna191221).)

It’s important to emphasize that the specific details of this arrangement are still coming into focus, and a spokesperson for [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/)’s government said that plans are not yet final. “The possible transfer of an aircraft for temporary use as [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/) is currently under consideration between [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/)’s Ministry of Defense and the [U.S. Department of Defense](https://www.defense.gov/), but the matter remains under review by the respective legal departments, and no decision has been made,” Ali Al-Ansari, [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/)’s Media Attaché to the U.S., [told Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/11/qatar-calls-jet-gift-trump-inaccurate-00341084).

The intended beneficiary of [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/)’s apparent generosity, however, characterized the developments as a “fact” in an overnight missive published to his social media platform.

“So the fact that the [Defense Department](https://www.defense.gov/) is getting a GIFT, FREE OF CHARGE, of a 747 aircraft to replace the 40 year old [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/), temporarily, in a very public and transparent transaction, so bothers the Crooked Democrats that they insist we pay, TOP DOLLAR, for the plane,” [Trump wrote](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114492082555622686). “Anybody can do that! The Dems are World Class Losers!!! MAGA”

So let me see if I have this straight. The [sitting American president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is eager to accept the largest foreign gift in the history of the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/), which he intends to keep after he exits the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), in [defiance of the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/investigation-trump-businesses-received-millions-foreign-governments-rcna132278) — a black-letter legal provision that the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) is on record dismissing as “[phony](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/21/donald-trump-mocks-constitution-emoluments-clause-phony/4055162002/).” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is prepared to welcome a foreign government’s largess, even as that same country [strikes private deals with the president’s family-run business](https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/trump-family-business-gulf-06792821?mod=hp_lead_pos1).

This entire arrangement was approved by the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)'s [attorney general](https://www.justice.gov/) — who worked as a well-paid lobbyist for that [same country](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/).

It’s against this backdrop that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wrote that his critics are “crooked.”

[Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Chris Murphy (D-CT)](https://www.murphy.senate.gov/), who’s spent months focusing on [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) corruption, described these developments as “[wildly illegal](https://bsky.app/profile/chrismurphyct.bsky.social/post/3lovwaqial22e).” In theory, [congressional](https://www.congress.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) — many of whom [seemed quite concerned about Qatari gifts to American universities](https://www.ft.com/content/d0a16f75-8b05-4ff9-b5f1-d473d7f5a704) in the recent past — could easily come to the same conclusions.

But it seems more likely that [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) [lawmakers](https://www.congress.gov/) will again shrug with indifference.
