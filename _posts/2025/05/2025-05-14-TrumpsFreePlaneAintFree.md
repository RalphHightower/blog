title: "Trump Crime Family: Converting Trump’s “Free”Jumbo Jet Bribe From Qatar Will Be Expensive, Take Years to Make It As Secure As Air Force One"

## [Among the problems with Trump’s ‘free’ luxury jet from Qatar: It’s not actually free](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/problems-trumps-free-luxury-jet-qatar-s-not-actually-free-rcna206706)

*Even if the jet from [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) were free, this arrangement would still be a legal and ethical mess. But the free plane also wouldn’t be free.*

May 14, 2025, 8:50 AM EDT
By Steve Benen

On Sunday night, as the public first learned about [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s plan to [accept a superluxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-scrambles-defend-luxury-jet-qatar-ll-use-air-force-one-rcna206207) from his friends in [Qatar to be used as Air Force One, the president was eager to defend the arrangement. The plane, [the Republican argued online](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114492082555622686), would be “FREE OF CHARGE.”

[Trump returned to the point a few days later, [asking why](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114503203859060399) taxpayers should be “forced to pay hundreds of millions of Dollars” for a plane “when they can get it for FREE” from Qatar. He [added soon after](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/us/politics/trump-qatar-plane-jet.html) that only “a stupid person [would] say, ‘No, we don’t want a free, very expensive](airplane.’”)

Even if the luxury jet were free, this arrangement would still be a legal, ethical and political mess. But there’s a related problem: The “free” plane wouldn’t be free. [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/turning-qatari-747-air-force-one-cost-1-billion-take-years-experts-say-rcna206582) reported:

> *"Converting a [Qatari](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/)-owned [747 jet](https://www.boeing.com/commercial/747-8) into a new [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/) for [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) would involve installing multiple top-secret systems, cost over \$1 billion and take years to complete, three aviation experts told [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/). They said that accepting the 13-year-old jet would likely cost [U.S. taxpayers](https://www.irs.gov/) hundreds of millions of dollars over time, noting that refurbishing the commercial plane would exceed its current value of \$400 million."*

[Politico](https://www.politico.com/) had [a related report](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/12/trump-qatar-air-force-one-taxpayer-costs-00342299) that noted it “could cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars” to retrofit [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/)’s “gift” into a makeshift [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/).

“This isn’t really a gift,” said [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Joe Courtney](https://courtney.house.gov/) told [Politico](https://www.politico.com/). The [Connecticut](https://portal.ct.gov/) [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/), who serves on the [House Armed Services Committee](https://armedservices.house.gov/) and helps oversee its panel on executive airlift, added, “You’d basically have to tear the plane down to the studs and rebuild it to meet all the survivability, security and communications requirements of [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/). It’s a massive undertaking — and an unfunded one at that.”

In other words, when [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) says the jet from [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) would be “FREE OF CHARGE,” it’s true that it would be free for him — the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) wouldn’t have to reach for his own wallet — but it wouldn’t be free to us, the [American taxpayers](https://www.irs.gov/).

[Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Minority Leader](https://bioguide.congress.gov/search/bio/S000148) [Chuck Schumer](https://www.schumer.senate.gov/) did a nice job Tuesday asking some important questions that the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) hasn’t even tried to answer.

“If the [American taxpayers](https://www.irs.gov/) are forced to pay for this temporary plane, does it mean that the U.S. government will cancel the contract for the future [Boeing](https://www.boeing.com/) plane? If so, how much will that cancellation cost?” the [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) asked. “If not, why are [American taxpayers](https://www.irs.gov/) being asked to spend hundreds of millions of dollars or more on a plane that will only be used for a year or two?”

Soon after [Schumer](https://www.schumer.senate.gov/)’s comments, [Senate](https:////www.senate.gov/) [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org) tried to advance a resolution that condemned “any acceptance of a [Presidential](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) aircraft, or any other substantial gift, from a foreign government as a grave national security threat to the [Office of the President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)” and demanded that such a gift could only be accepted with the approval of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/).

[Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Tommy Tuberville](https://www.tuberville.senate.gov/) of [Alabama](https://www.alabama.gov/) [blocked the measure](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-saudi-arabia-tariffs-live-update-rcna206060/rcrd79398?canonicalCard=true).

[Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Brian Schatz](https://www.schatz.senate.gov/) of [Hawaii](https://portal.ehawaii.gov/), who introduced the resolution, said, “I remain flabbergasted that this thing is not going to pass. I remain completely aghast. This is the most blatant, obvious, ridiculous, gross corruption that I’ve ever seen in my entire life — by dollar amount, by symbolism, by violating [constitutional](https://constitution.congress.gov/) and statutory law.”
