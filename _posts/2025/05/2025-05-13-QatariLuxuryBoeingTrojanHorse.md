title: "The $400,000,000 Qatari Boeing 747-8 Jumbo Jet Is a Trojan  Horse"
---


This [Qatari](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) is a Trojan Horse. The [Boeing](https://www.boeing.com/) [747-8](https://www.boeing.com/commercial/747-8) would have to be stripped down to the airframe to make sure that there are no listening devices or tracking devices embedded in [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s gift. Plus the airframe and electronics have to be hardened to be able to withstand an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) generated by a nuclear blast.

- How long would that take?
- How much would it cost?

## [Trump's jet from Qatar is worrisome. What he’s giving in return is troubling.](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-qatar-jet-corruption-concessions-rcna206761)

*The only thing that unites the policies the president has announced on his Middle East tour so far is that they are exactly what the Gulf states wanted.*

May 14, 2025, 2:36 PM EDT / Updated May 14, 2025, 3:16 PM EDT
By Chris Hayes

This is an adapted excerpt from the [May 13](https://www.msnbc.com/all) episode of “All In with Chris Hayes.”

For decades, going back to [Ronald Reagan](https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/), when an [American president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) makes their first visit to a foreign nation, they almost always go to [Canada](https://www.canada.ca/). It makes sense: They’re our top trading partner; we share a language and a very long border. But in 2017, [Donald Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/donald-trump) did not do that.

Instead, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) went to the oil-rich kingdom of [Saudi Arabia](https://my.gov.sa/), where he joined in [laying hands on a glowing orb](https://www.nbcnews.com/video/watch-president-trump-touch-glowing-counterterrorism-orb-950400579770)
 . During that trip, he also forged a close friendship with the nation’s crown prince, [Mohammed bin Salman](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-recent-interactions-saudis-crown-prince-matter-rcna146395), who would later invest \$2 billion in a business owned by [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s son-in-law, against [the advice of his own economic experts](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/10/us/jared-kushner-saudi-investment-fund.html).

> *It’s worth noting that before that announcement, [Syria](https://egov.sy/)’s leader offered to build a [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [Tower](https://www.trump.com/) in Damascus.*

Eight years later, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is president again. This time around, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), once again, decided he wasn’t going to [Canada](https://www.canada.ca/), the country he [openly wants to annex](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-canada-tariff-war-annex-trudeau-rcna195882). Instead, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) went back to the Middle East, landing in [Riyadh](https://www.alriyadh.gov.sa/), [Saudi Arabia](https://my.gov.sa/), on Tuesday, with plans to visit [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) and the [United Arab Emirates](https://u.ae/) next.

The [Saudis](https://my.gov.sa/), the [Qataris](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) and the [Emiratis](https://u.ae/) all clearly understood the assignment. Take the crown prince: He greeted [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) on the tarmac and rolled out the [royal purple carpet](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/watch/-unprecedented-spectacle-trump-given-royal-treatment-by-his-new-close-friends-in-saudi-arabia-239488581712).

Not only did the [Saudis](https://my.gov.sa/) welcome Trump with open arms, but they also welcomed his co-president, [Elon Musk](https://www.nbcnews.com/video/elon-musk-meets-saudi-crown-prince-mohammed-bin-salman-239445573787). However, [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) wasn’t the only billionaire on the trip. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and the crown prince joined forces to open a [U.S.](https://www.usa.gov/)-[Saudi](https://my.gov.sa/) investment forum for [big-money players](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-boasts-saudi-arabian-investments-are-hard-take-seriously-rcna206766?icid=latestpost_bot) from the two nations, with speakers from U.S. firms like [Citigroup](https://www.citigroup.com/global), [BlackRock](https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual) and [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/).

The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) claims [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) “secured \$600 billion in deals with the [Saudi government and firms](https://my.gov.sa/).” But, [according to The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/world/middleeast/trump-saudi-economic-forum.html), “the details the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) provided were vague and totaled less than half that number. And a closer look at the projects the administration provided shows several were already in the works before [Mr. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) took office.” But [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) claimed a big win, and so the [president] responsible for the [“Muslim ban”](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/muslims-me-know-evil-power-trump-s-dead-muslim-ban-n1255017) posed onstage in front of a massive [Saudi flag](https://my.gov.sa/) and was applauded.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) had some other big gifts ready, too. The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) announced a [\$142 billion arms agreement](https://www.reuters.com/world/us-saudi-arabia-have-discussed-riyadhs-potential-purchase-f-35-jets-2025-05-13/) to provide the [Saudis](https://my.gov.sa/) with [U.S. weapons and defense contractors](https://www.defense.gov/) to maintain them. He also announced that he plans to [lift sanctions on Syria](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-says-us-will-end-sanctions-syria-works-deepen-diplomatic-ties-sa-rcna206471), which [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said was at the behest of the [Saudis](https://my.gov.sa/). “Oh, what I do for the crown prince,” he said from the stage.

While that announcement was a good one and those sanctions on [Syria](https://egov.sy/) should be dropped, we should not drop them as a favor to the [Saudi crown prince] who threw \$2 billion at your son-in-law.

It’s also worth noting that before that announcement, [Syria](https://egov.sy/)’s leader offered to build a [Trump Tower](https://www.trump.com/) in Damascus] and said he would give the U.S. mineral rights contracts in his country, according to several sources familiar with the efforts who [spoke with Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-tower-damascus-syria-seeks-charm-us-president-sanctions-relief-2025-05-11/).

Mideast diplomacy is one of the most complicated, fraught areas of American foreign policy, and out of the gate, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is basically just going down a list of policies that the [Saudis](https://my.gov.sa/) and their allies wanted.

Policywise, some of those concessions are better than others; corrupt processes can sometimes accidentally create a decent policy here and there. But they’re not policies so much as presents for his overseas buddies, and, in return, those buddies are giving him what he wants.

Which brings us, of course, to [the Qatari jumbo jet](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/problems-trumps-free-luxury-jet-qatar-s-not-actually-free-rcna206706). A special [Boeing](https://www.boeing.com/) [747-8](https://www.boeing.com/commercial/747-8) that has been called a “palace of the sky” and a “flying mansion.” A luxury item worth \$400 million and gifted to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) by the [Qatari royal family](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) over the weekend.

It is full of leather, gold and burl wood accents. It sports at least three lounges, two bedrooms, nine bathrooms, five galleys and a private office. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is palpably stoked out of his shoes about this thing, like a very rich kid on Christmas morning getting the world’s most expensive toy.

Accepting this jet would be the most shockingly corrupt act by a president in the history of the presidency. It violates not only the spirit of [the Constitution](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/12/nx-s1-5395696/qatar-trump-plane-gift-ethics), but literally the text. However, according to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), not taking it would be “stupid.”

It seems the only thing that unites the policies [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has announced on his Middle East tour so far is that they are exactly what the Gulf states wanted.

> *The Gulf states don’t have huge armies, but they have a lot of oil and a lot of money, and they use it to extend their geopolitical dominance.*

It makes sense, this is the place [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) feels most at home because these countries get [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) in a way they never got any other [American president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). That’s because this [American president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [openly admires despots](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/maddow-trump-admiration-for-dictators-reflects-shared-goal-of-power-control-218961477503) and envies what they have.

The Gulf states that are hosting [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) understand that. They recognize he is not there for 330 million Americans. He is there for himself, and they are there to indulge him. It’s not because [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is a unique force of nature. He is not special; he is just easy.

He’s not even the first foreign leader to be gifted a [747-8](https://www.boeing.com/commercial/747-8) by the [Qataris](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/). [Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-45550537) got a half-billion-dollar jumbo jet back in 2018.

But this is the thing: The Gulf states have been doing this forever. They don’t have huge armies, but they have a lot of oil and a lot of money, and they use it to extend their geopolitical dominance. That only goes so far with a traditional, law-abiding [American](https://www.usa.gov/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/). However, with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), a man not just willing but thirsty to trade on the trappings of the office that [American voters](www.fec.gov/) bestowed on him, the sky is the limit.

## [Among the problems with Trump’s ‘free’ luxury jet from Qatar: It’s not actually free](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/problems-trumps-free-luxury-jet-qatar-s-not-actually-free-rcna206706)

*Even if the jet from [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) were free, this arrangement would still be a legal and ethical mess. But the free plane also wouldn’t be free.*

May 14, 2025, 8:50 AM EDT
By Steve Benen

On Sunday night, as the public first learned about [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s plan to [accept a superluxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-scrambles-defend-luxury-jet-qatar-ll-use-air-force-one-rcna206207) from his friends in [Qatar to be used as Air Force One, the president was eager to defend the arrangement. The plane, [the Republican argued online](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114492082555622686), would be “FREE OF CHARGE.”

[Trump returned to the point a few days later, [asking why](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114503203859060399) taxpayers should be “forced to pay hundreds of millions of Dollars” for a plane “when they can get it for FREE” from Qatar. He [added soon after](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/us/politics/trump-qatar-plane-jet.html) that only “a stupid person [would] say, ‘No, we don’t want a free, very expensive](airplane.’”)

Even if the luxury jet were free, this arrangement would still be a legal, ethical and political mess. But there’s a related problem: The “free” plane wouldn’t be free. [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/turning-qatari-747-air-force-one-cost-1-billion-take-years-experts-say-rcna206582) reported:

> *"Converting a [Qatari](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/)-owned [747 jet](https://www.boeing.com/commercial/747-8) into a new [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/) for [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) would involve installing multiple top-secret systems, cost over \$1 billion and take years to complete, three aviation experts told [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/). They said that accepting the 13-year-old jet would likely cost [U.S. taxpayers](https://www.irs.gov/) hundreds of millions of dollars over time, noting that refurbishing the commercial plane would exceed its current value of \$400 million."*

[Politico](https://www.politico.com/) had [a related report](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/12/trump-qatar-air-force-one-taxpayer-costs-00342299) that noted it “could cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars” to retrofit [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/)’s “gift” into a makeshift [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/).

“This isn’t really a gift,” said [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Joe Courtney](https://courtney.house.gov/) told [Politico](https://www.politico.com/). The [Connecticut](https://portal.ct.gov/) [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/), who serves on the [House Armed Services Committee](https://armedservices.house.gov/) and helps oversee its panel on executive airlift, added, “You’d basically have to tear the plane down to the studs and rebuild it to meet all the survivability, security and communications requirements of [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/). It’s a massive undertaking — and an unfunded one at that.”

In other words, when [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) says the jet from [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) would be “FREE OF CHARGE,” it’s true that it would be free for him — the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) wouldn’t have to reach for his own wallet — but it wouldn’t be free to us, the [American taxpayers](https://www.irs.gov/).

[Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Minority Leader](https://bioguide.congress.gov/search/bio/S000148) [Chuck Schumer](https://www.schumer.senate.gov/) did a nice job Tuesday asking some important questions that the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) hasn’t even tried to answer.

“If the [American taxpayers](https://www.irs.gov/) are forced to pay for this temporary plane, does it mean that the U.S. government will cancel the contract for the future [Boeing](https://www.boeing.com/) plane? If so, how much will that cancellation cost?” the [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) asked. “If not, why are [American taxpayers](https://www.irs.gov/) being asked to spend hundreds of millions of dollars or more on a plane that will only be used for a year or two?”

Soon after [Schumer](https://www.schumer.senate.gov/)’s comments, [Senate](https:////www.senate.gov/) [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org) tried to advance a resolution that condemned “any acceptance of a [Presidential](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) aircraft, or any other substantial gift, from a foreign government as a grave national security threat to the [Office of the President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)” and demanded that such a gift could only be accepted with the approval of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/).

[Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Tommy Tuberville](https://www.tuberville.senate.gov/) of [Alabama](https://www.alabama.gov/) [blocked the measure](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-saudi-arabia-tariffs-live-update-rcna206060/rcrd79398?canonicalCard=true).

[Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Brian Schatz](https://www.schatz.senate.gov/) of [Hawaii](https://portal.ehawaii.gov/), who introduced the resolution, said, “I remain flabbergasted that this thing is not going to pass. I remain completely aghast. This is the most blatant, obvious, ridiculous, gross corruption that I’ve ever seen in my entire life — by dollar amount, by symbolism, by violating [constitutional](https://constitution.congress.gov/) and statutory law.”

*[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s plan to accept a luxury jet as a gift from the [Qatari](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) royal family has led to broad criticism — including from the MAGA faithful.*

May 13, 2025, 11:39 AM EDT / Updated May 13, 2025, 1:18 PM EDT

By [Clarissa-Jan Lim](https://www.msnbc.com/author/clarissa-jan-lim-ncpn1307846)

[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s plan to [accept a luxury jet from the Qatari royal family](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/qatar-trump-jet-gift-plane-corrupt-newsletter-rcna206330) has led to an uproar among ethics experts, [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) and [even some Republicans](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-struggles-defend-qatars-luxury-jet-gift-republicans-are-divided-rcna206447). But some of the loudest criticism has come from his most fervent MAGA supporters.

On his podcast Monday, The Daily Wire co-founder Ben Shapiro [pointed to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYBuphYtp6I&t=1907s) [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/)’s relationship with the [Muslim Brotherhood](https://www.ikhwanonline.com/article/) and [Hamas](https://hamasinfo.info/), saying that accepting a gift from the royal family is “not America First.”

If you want [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to succeed, this kind of skeezy stuff needs to stop.

“Is this good for [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), is it good for his agenda? Is it good for draining the swamp and getting things done? The answer is no, it isn’t,” Shapiro said. “It isn’t. If you want [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to succeed, this kind of skeezy stuff needs to stop.”

He added: “I think if we switched the names to Hunter Biden and [Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/), we’d all be freaking out on the right.”

Far-right influencer [Laura Loomer](https://www.loomered.com/), who has had [direct access to Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/way-too-early/watch/firing-of-nsa-chief-raises-concerns-about-laura-loomer-s-influence-236691013909), wrote a series of posts criticizing the gift.

“I love [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). I would take a bullet for him,” she [wrote on X](https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/1921615017138618439) on Sunday. “But, I have to call a spade a spade. We cannot accept a \$400 million ‘gift’ from jihadists in suits.”

[Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) host [Mark Levin](https://www.foxnews.com/person/l/mark-levin) shared [Loomer](https://www.loomered.com/)’s post, [adding](https://x.com/marklevinshow/status/1921701015516057967): “Ditto.”

[Loomer](https://www.loomered.com/), however, also tempered some of her criticism with effusive praise for the president. “It will be a stain, but he is still the best [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) of my lifetime,” she [wrote on X](https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/1921987426131837358) on Monday.

First [reported by ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-administration-poised-accept-palace-sky-gift-trump/story?id=121680511), the super luxury [Boeing](https://www.boeing.com/) [747-8 jumbo jet](https://www.boeing.com/commercial/747-8) — which is estimated to be valued at \$400 million — from Qatar is expected to be converted for use as Air Force One. The overhaul would take years and a potentially hefty price tag, along with a host of security concerns, according to aviation and intelligence experts who [spoke with NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/america-first-trump-qatar-luxury-jet-air-force-one-rcna206254).

Meanwhile, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has defended his decision to accept the plane, calling it “a great gesture from [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/)” and suggesting it was too good an offer to pass up on.

[“I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer,” he said Monday when pressed about the deal. “I mean, I could be a stupid person [and] say, ‘No, we don’t want a free, very expensive](airplane.’”)

In defending the gift of a [super luxury jumbo jet he’s preparing to receive from the royal family of Qatar](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-scrambles-defend-luxury-jet-qatar-ll-use-air-force-one-rcna206207) to use as [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/), [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) described it as a brilliant deal. Not for the American people, it isn’t.

The [Boeing](https://www.boeing.com/) [747-8](https://www.boeing.com/commercial/747-8) jet is so lavish it is estimated [to be worth around \$400 million](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-administration-poised-accept-palace-sky-gift-trump/story?id=121680511), and Jessica Levinson, a law professor at [Loyola](https://www.luc.edu/) [Law School](https://www.luc.edu/law/) and an [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) columnist, [has said](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-luxury-jet-gift-boeing-qatar-legal-concerns-explainer-2025-5) that “a gift of this size from a foreign government is unprecedented in our nation’s history.” Ali Al-Ansari, [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/)’s media attaché to the U.S., [said in a statement that](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-administration-will-accept-luxury-jet-qatar-use-air-force-one-rcna206111) that the deal is not final, as “the matter remains under review by the respective legal departments” of the two countries’ defense departments.

> *Contrary to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s insinuation that this is actually good for [Americans](https://www.usa.gov/), by accepting the luxe jet he’d be taking the [American public](https://www.usa.gov/) for a ride.*

After [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) objected to the planned transfer of the “flying palace” as unconstitutional and corrupt, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) suggested [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) ought to be in awe of his deal-making abilities. The real offense, he said, would be paying for the plane. “So the fact that the [Defense Department](https://www.defense.gov/) is getting a GIFT, FREE OF CHARGE, of a 747 aircraft to replace the 40 year old [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/), temporarily, in a very public and transparent transaction, so bothers the Crooked Democrats that they insist we pay, TOP DOLLAR, for the plane,” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [posted on Truth Social](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114492082555622686). “Anybody can do that! The Dems are World Class Losers!!! MAGA.”

Contrary to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s insinuation that this is actually good for [Americans](https://www.usa.gov/), by accepting the luxe jet he’d be taking the [American public](https://www.usa.gov/) for a ride. The [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/)’s [emoluments clause](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S1-C7-1/ALDE_00000233/) [prohibits public officeholders from receiving gifts from foreign states](https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/articles/article-i/clauses/759) without consent from [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/). There’s a simple reason for that: Those countries have their own interests that are separate from, and often at odds with, the interests of the [American public](https://www.usa.gov/). By accepting the jet, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) would be accepting a favor that could raise the potential for a reciprocal act that serves the interests of [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) instead of the [U.S.](https://www.usa.gov/)

“There is no question that any court that got to the merits would find a violation of the foreign emoluments clause,” [Jeff Hauser](https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/author/jeff-hauser/), executive director of the [Revolving Door Project](https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/ ), a public interest watchdog, told me.

[ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/), citing sources familiar with the plan, [reported](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-administration-poised-accept-palace-sky-gift-trump/story?id=121680511) that “[Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) and [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s top [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) lawyer David Warrington concluded it would be ‘legally permissible’ for the donation of the aircraft to be conditioned on transferring its ownership to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s presidential library before the end of his term.” (It’s worth noting, as my colleague Steve Benen [pointed out](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-scrambles-defend-luxury-jet-qatar-ll-use-air-force-one-rcna206207), that [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) “used to work as a registered lobbyist for foreign clients, [including the government of Qatar](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/pam-bondi-tapped-trump-ag-still-haunted-controversies-rcna181609).”)

But [Hauser](https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/author/jeff-hauser/) argued that its eventual donation to the library — where it appears plausible that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his family could continue to use the aircraft after his term ends — makes it no less of a violation of the [emoluments clause](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S1-C7-1/ALDE_00000233/). “You absolutely cannot use the existence of a nonprofit organization as a shield against political corruption,” [Hauser](https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/author/jeff-hauser/) said. “You can be corrupt on behalf of a charity.”

Think about it this way: Even if you re-gift a gift, it doesn’t change the fact that you received a gift. That applies even if [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) doesn’t use the jet after exiting the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). Of course the premise for this gift is to replace the aging aircraft in the [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/) fleet with an impressive new jet, as [Boeing’s contract to replace them has been delayed and plagued by cost issues](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-administration-poised-accept-palace-sky-gift-trump/story?id=121680511).

Avoiding conflict of interest matters beyond the corrupt back-scratching scenarios that they can set in motion. They also help maintain citizen trust in the government. A [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) who can only think of human interactions — including governance — as a series of private zero-sum transactions may not care about, or even understand, that.

It doesn’t matter whether [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) agreed to a specific quid pro quo behind closed doors. A free jumbo jet for [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/) is a big favor — and a hugely tangible and personal one at that. There would be no way to extricate that from the rapport between the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) going forward — it would be baked in as part of the bartering capital [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) has with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) in future instances when discussing everything from policy on [Iran](https://irangov.ir/) to [Israel](https://www.gov.il/) to natural gas deals. Moreover, other countries around the world will observe this and surmise that U.S. policy may be sold to the highest bidder.

By Anthony L. Fisher, Senior Editor, [MSNBC Daily](https://www.msnbc.com/)

“I could be a stupid person and say no, we don’t want a free plane,” [said the president of the United States](https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/-are-you-kidding-me-why-trump-accepting-luxury-jet-from-qatar-raises-security-questions-239367749859) about the [Boeing](https://www.boeing.com/) [747-8](https://www.boeing.com/commercial/747-8) which [the royal family](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-scrambles-defend-luxury-jet-qatar-ll-use-air-force-one-rcna206207) that rules [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) has offered as a gift.

There are obviously ethical, legal and constitutional issues — to say nothing of security concerns — with [President Donald Trump’s willingness to accept a \$400 million donation](https://www.msnbc.com/chris-jansing-reports/watch/ethics-of-this-is-highly-questionable-reaction-to-trump-defending-offer-of-luxury-jet-from-qatar-239390789997) from a Middle East petrostate with [tens of billions of dollars of business interests](https://usqbc.org/) in the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/). (It’s also more than a bit hypocritical, given that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) leads the party still obsessed with [Hunter Biden’s comparatively low-stakes shady overseas business dealings](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/hunter-biden-s-business-bad-look-here-s-how-fix-n1294057).) [Sen.](https://www.usa.gov/) [Bernie Sanders (I-VT)](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/), put it concisely [in a post on X](https://x.com/BernieSanders/status/1921643208343204053): “Not only is this farcically corrupt, it is blatantly unconstitutional. [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) must not allow this over-the-top kleptocracy to proceed.”

Perhaps less noticed is that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is poised to accept an exorbitant personal gift of a jumbo jet (meant to be used as [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/)) from a government that has provided substantial funding for the antisemitic, fascistic terror group [Hamas](https://hamasinfo.info/) about 100 days after he signed his “[Executive Order to Combat Anti-Semitism](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/additional-measures-to-combat-anti-semitism/).” (For years, [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) funded [Hamas](https://hamasinfo.info/) [with the support of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Israeli government](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-03-26/ty-article/.premium/prime-ministers-office-netanyahu-knew-that-hamas-had-diverted-4m-to-military-wing/00000195-cf86-d104-adfd-ffdf9e100000).)

> *[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is poised to accept an exorbitant personal gift from a government that has provided substantial funding for the antisemitic, fascistic terror group [Hamas](https://hamasinfo.info/).*

At the same time, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) continues to employ Kingsley Wilson as deputy press secretary for the [Department of Defense](https://www.defense.gov/), despite a recent social media record of posts [widely seen as antisemitic](https://www.thebulwark.com/p/shes-just-the-tip-of-the-trump-administration-racist-antisemitic-iceberg-kingsley-wilson-andrew-tate). And since [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) returned to the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), two powerful members of his inner circle have made “[“stiff-armed salutes”](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/steve-bannon-nazi-salute-cpac-rcna193167)” in front of big crowds and many cameras. Yet, the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has used the thinnest of pretexts to characterize activists as antisemitic, before then claiming they’re providing material support to [Hamas](https://hamasinfo.info/).

“To all the resident aliens who joined in the pro-jihadist protests, we put you on notice: come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you,” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said in a [White House fact sheet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-takes-forceful-and-unprecedented-steps-to-combat-anti-semitism/) that accompanied his [January antisemitism executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/additional-measures-to-combat-anti-semitism/). He also promised to “quickly cancel the student visas of all [Hamas](https://hamasinfo.info/) sympathizers on college campuses, which have been infested with radicalism like never before.”

Indeed, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s supposed war on antisemitism is his rationale for his war on universities and campus activism. Meanwhile, [pro-Israel](https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-851431) and [Trump-friendly media outlets](https://www.thefp.com/p/explosion-in-foreign-funding-for-american-universities) have published many articles and op-eds decrying what they say is the nefarious influence of Qatari billions on U.S. universities and [student activist groups](https://www.dailynews.com/2024/04/30/qatari-money-and-the-pro-palestinian-campus-takeovers/). (We’ll have to check back in later to see if they’re equally appalled by [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/)’s lavish funding of an [American president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s air travel.)

The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has tried to justify its deportation proceedings against Mahmoud Khalil, the green-card holder and spouse of a U.S. citizen who served as a mediator and spokesperson for a pro-[Palestinian](https://mofa.pna.ps/)/anti-[Israel](https://www.gov.il/) student activist group encamped last year on the campus of [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/), on the basis of fighting antisemitism. [Secretary](https://www.state.gov/biographies/marco-rubio/) of [State](https://www.state.gov/) [Marco Rubio](https://www.state.gov/biographies/marco-rubio/) later admitted Khalil had broken no laws, and the government has yet to provide any evidence that Khalil spread [Hamas](https://hamasinfo.info/) propaganda or participated in any harassment of [last month a federal judge ruled](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/palestinian-activist-khalil-mahmoud-can-fight-wrongful-detention-case-rcna203654) he can challenge the government’s deportation attempt in court.)

[NBC News reviewed over 100 pages of documents](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/governments-case-mahmoud-khalil-shaky-reliant-tabloid-accounts-review-rcna201254) the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) filed as evidence to back up its deportation efforts for Khalil, and found that “in some instances, the [government](https://www.usa.gov/) appears to be relying on unverified tabloid articles about Khalil. In others, the [government](https://www.usa.gov/)’s claims about him are clearly erroneous because timelines don’t match.”

> *Let’s call [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s so-called war on antisemitism what it is: [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s cudgel to attack his [perceived enemies](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-the-weaponization-of-the-federal-government/).*

In plain English, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s claims that they’re battling antisemitism are absurd. In fact, they are falsely likening protected speech with which they object (such as [co-signing an op-ed](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/12/us/where-things-stand-highest-immigration-cases-trump-hnk) critical of [Israel](https://www.gov.il/)’s conduct in the war in [Gaza](https://mofa.pna.ps/)) to a national security crisis requiring the most severe methods of enforcement, including denials of due process. The [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) is also cloaking its [brazen attempt to shake down universities](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-new-york-city-columbia-hochul-congestion-pricing-rcna197178) and bring them to heel politically by withholding federal funds in the name of “protecting” Jews.

As [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) put in the [antisemitism EO](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/additional-measures-to-combat-anti-semitism/)’s [fact sheet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-takes-forceful-and-unprecedented-steps-to-combat-anti-semitism/), “My promise to Jewish Americans is this: With your vote, I will be your defender, your protector, and I will be the best friend Jewish Americans have ever had in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).”

But in accepting a \$400 million personal gift from [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/), a country that funded the group that gleefully butchered Jews on Oct. 7, 2023, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has made an absolute mockery of his “war on antisemitism.” Let’s call [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s so-called war on antisemitism what it is: Trump’s cudgel to [attack his perceived enemies](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-the-weaponization-of-the-federal-government/).

## [Pressed on corruption allegations against Trump, Karoline Leavitt offers pitiful defense](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/pressed-corruption-allegations-trump-karoline-leavitt-offers-pitiful-d-rcna206344)

*[White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) press secretary Karoline Leavitt pushed back against questions about the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s grifts. It was a predictable failure.*

By Steve Benen

Even before a foreign government eager to curry favor with the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [offered Donald Trump a superluxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-scrambles-defend-luxury-jet-qatar-ll-use-air-force-one-rcna206207) those concerned with the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and corruption allegations focused their attention on [his outlandish meme coin gambit](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-controversial-meme-coin-contest-proves-predictably-profitable-p-rcna203293), which [has proved](https://apnews.com/article/trump-meme-coin-crypto-75063140a2223eb2698db7435dfaf5ac) to be quite lucrative, which appears to have created [influence opportunities](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/us/politics/auction-to-dine-with-trump-creates-foreign-influence-opportunity.html) that foreigners have reportedly [taken advantage of](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2025-trump-memecoin-foreign-crypto-traders/?embedded-checkout=true), and which has been fairly described as “the most brazenly corrupt thing a president has ever done.”

It’s against this backdrop that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is preparing to leave for the Middle East — his first major foreign trip of his second term — and a reporter asked [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) press secretary Karoline Leavitt whether the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) intends to meet with the [Trump Organization](https://www.trump.com%)’s business partners in the region. She apparently didn’t care for the line of inquiry.

“I think it’s frankly ridiculous that anyone in this room would even suggest that [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is doing anything for his own benefit,” Leavitt argued. “He left a life of luxury and a life of running a very successful real estate empire for public service, not just once but twice.”

Leavitt [went on to claim](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-press-conference-briefing-karoline-leavitt-may-9-2025/), with a straight face, that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) “has actually lost money for being [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) of the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/).”

In response to a question about the [meme coin](https://gettrumpmemes.com/) controversy, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s chief spokesperson added that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) “is abiding by all conflict of interest laws” and “has been incredibly transparent with his own personal financial obligations.”

So, a few things.

First, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) didn’t leave “a life of luxury.” He lives in a [presidential mansion](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), filled with a small army of people who call him “sir” and cater to his every whim, and spends most of his weekends at a [glorified country club in Florida](https://www.maralagoclub.com/), where he’s surrounded by sycophantic supporters who pay handsomely to hang out at a playground for the rich.

Second, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) oversaw a [real estate empire](https://www.trump.com/), but to call it “very successful” is, to put mildly, [a real stretch](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-schemes-fred-trump.html).

Third, given [the frequency with which Trump has tried to profit off the presidency](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-second-term-evidence-suggests-corruption-will-worse-not-better-rcna179589), I’d love for Leavitt to elaborate on why she considers this line of inquiry to be “ridiculous.”

Fourth, if the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) believes [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has been “incredibly transparent” with his finances, I have a follow-up question about the tax returns he has fought to keep secret.

Fifth, Leavitt might want people to believe that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) “is abiding by all conflict of interest laws,” but as she really ought to know, [presidents aren’t bound by the most serious conflict of interest laws](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-administration-pirro-pope-leo-uk-trade-immigration-live-updates-rcna204765/rcrd79129?canonicalCard=true).

Sixth, the idea that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) “has actually lost money” while serving as [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [appears to be at odds with reality](https://newrepublic.com/post/195088/karoline-leavitt-snaps-donald-trump-profiting-off-presidency).

To be sure, I don’t mean to sound unsympathetic. The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s [many grifts](https://paulwaldman.substack.com/p/what-trumps-corruption-will-cost) are the stuff of legend, and if I were his press secretary, I’d probably struggle to come up with a persuasive defense, too.

But if Leavitt believes her talking points are going to end the corruption discussion, she’s likely to be disappointed.

*The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) tried to defend an apparent plan in which he’d get to use a luxury jet from the government of [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/). It didn’t go well.*

In [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [first term](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/), the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) cultivated an unexpectedly amusing list of incidents related to airplanes. I actually [maintained a list](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-takes-aim-the-complexity-modern-airplanes-msna1203801), documenting a curious array of stories in which the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [suggested that F-35s are literally invisible](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-genuinely-seems-believe-f-35s-are-literally-invisible-n1131361), whined about [the complexity of piloting](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-takes-aim-the-complexity-modern-airplanes-msna1203801), referenced F-52s [that didn’t exist](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-boasts-about-norway-buying-fighter-jets-dont-exist) outside of video games, [complained to members of Congress](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trumps-preoccupation-airplanes-seems-little-weird) that the [emir](https://www.da.gov.kw/) of [Kuwait](https://www.cmgs.gov.kw/)’s plane was bigger than his, and ([among other things](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-takes-aim-the-complexity-modern-airplanes-msna1203801)) got caught [lying about Japan](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-touts-another-airplane-deal-doesnt-exist) buying U.S. fighter jets and [lying about Finland](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-says-finland-buying-us-fighter-jets-finland-disagrees) doing the same thing.

In his [second term](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), the news at the intersection of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and planes is far less funny. [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-administration-will-accept-luxury-jet-qatar-use-air-force-one-rcna206111):

> *The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) is preparing to accept a superluxury [Boeing](https://www.boeing.com/) [747-8](https://www.boeing.com/commercial/747-8) jumbo jet from the royal family of [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) as a gift to be used by [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) as the new [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/) for presidential travel until shortly before [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) leaves office, according to four sources familiar with the planning. Two of the sources also confirm that ownership of the plane will be transferred to the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) presidential library foundation once the president ends his second term.*

According to [a report from ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-administration-poised-accept-palace-sky-gift-trump/story?id=121680511), which was the first to break this story, [Attorney General](www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) and other [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) lawyers determined that the acceptance of the plane was legally permissible if the [Qatari](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) government gifts it to the [Defense Department](https://www.defense.gov) and it is later turned over to the [Trump Library Foundation](http://www.trumplibrary.gov/).

This is notable for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is the [attorney general](https://www.justice.gov/)’s recent professional background: [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) used to work as a registered lobbyist for foreign clients, [including the government of Qatar](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/pam-bondi-tapped-trump-ag-still-haunted-controversies-rcna181609) — the same government that’s apparently preparing to reward [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) with a jet. (Soon after [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) made her the nation’s chief law enforcement official, [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) [also disbanded the FBI’s Foreign Influence Task Force](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/ag-pam-bondi-shutters-fbis-foreign-influence-task-force-rcna191221).)

It’s important to emphasize that the specific details of this arrangement are still coming into focus, and a spokesperson for [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/)’s government said that plans are not yet final. “The possible transfer of an aircraft for temporary use as [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/) is currently under consideration between [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/)’s Ministry of Defense and the [U.S. Department of Defense](https://www.defense.gov/), but the matter remains under review by the respective legal departments, and no decision has been made,” Ali Al-Ansari, [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/)’s Media Attaché to the U.S., [told Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/11/qatar-calls-jet-gift-trump-inaccurate-00341084).

The intended beneficiary of [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/)’s apparent generosity, however, characterized the developments as a “fact” in an overnight missive published to his social media platform.

“So the fact that the [Defense Department](https://www.defense.gov/) is getting a GIFT, FREE OF CHARGE, of a 747 aircraft to replace the 40 year old [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/), temporarily, in a very public and transparent transaction, so bothers the Crooked Democrats that they insist we pay, TOP DOLLAR, for the plane,” [Trump wrote](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114492082555622686). “Anybody can do that! The Dems are World Class Losers!!! MAGA”

So let me see if I have this straight. The [sitting American president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is eager to accept the largest foreign gift in the history of the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/), which he intends to keep after he exits the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), in [defiance of the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/investigation-trump-businesses-received-millions-foreign-governments-rcna132278) — a black-letter legal provision that the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) is on record dismissing as “[phony](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/21/donald-trump-mocks-constitution-emoluments-clause-phony/4055162002/).” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is prepared to welcome a foreign government’s largess, even as that same country [strikes private deals with the president’s family-run business](https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/trump-family-business-gulf-06792821?mod=hp_lead_pos1).

This entire arrangement was approved by the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)'s [attorney general](https://www.justice.gov/) — who worked as a well-paid lobbyist for that [same country](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/).

It’s against this backdrop that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wrote that his critics are “crooked.”

[Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Chris Murphy (D-CT)](https://www.murphy.senate.gov/), who’s spent months focusing on [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) corruption, described these developments as “[wildly illegal](https://bsky.app/profile/chrismurphyct.bsky.social/post/3lovwaqial22e).” In theory, [congressional](https://www.congress.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) — many of whom [seemed quite concerned about Qatari gifts to American universities](https://www.ft.com/content/d0a16f75-8b05-4ff9-b5f1-d473d7f5a704) in the recent past — could easily come to the same conclusions.

But it seems more likely that [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) [lawmakers](https://www.congress.gov/) will again shrug with indifference.

## [Trump administration will accept a luxury jet from Qatar to use as Air Force One](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-administration-will-accept-luxury-jet-qatar-use-air-force-one-rcna206111)

*Trump is expected to discuss arrangements for the plane during his visit to Qatar this week, one source said.*

May 11, 2025, 12:59 PM EDT / Updated May 11, 2025, 6:16 PM EDT

The Trump administration is preparing to accept a superluxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet from the royal family of Qatar as a gift to be used by President Donald Trump as the new Air Force One for presidential travel until shortly before Trump leaves office, according to four sources familiar with the planning.

Two of the sources also confirm that ownership of the plane will be transferred to the Trump presidential library foundation once the president ends his second term.

According to one of the sources, the arrangement will be done according to U.S. and international laws, in observance of ethics rules. That official said it will take some time for the plane to be delivered but that the president will discuss the arrangement during his visit to Qatar this week.

Another one of the sources said the idea of gifting Trump this specific plane has been under discussion for “quite some time” and that when the formal offer was made more recently, the president “happily accepted.”

ABC News [first reported](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-administration-poised-accept-palace-sky-gift-trump/story?id=121680511__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!reDY8glbGcK94QLfFM5eHCtiA0WWkEfU23uSU2-SxKcWLkaI7DBCr-e71bIIRxPXscdUYPyB7qfKAJ3NSIo6e4WHnmzWQOGlZDMEDfHGfMWZN4hMOfDhOZ2r$) the gift.

In response to questions about [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) giving the plane to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) press secretary Karoline Leavitt said gifts from foreign governments are accepted following the law.

“Any gift given by a foreign government is always accepted in full compliance with all applicable laws,” Leavitt said. “[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) is committed to full transparency.”

A [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) official tells [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/) that it is true [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) has offered to donate a plane to the [Department of Defense](https://www.defense.gov/), but the gift will not be presented nor accepted this week while [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is in [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/).

Ali Al-Ansari, [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/)’s media attaché to the U.S., added in a statement, "The possible transfer of an aircraft for temporary use as [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/) is currently under consideration between [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/)’s [Ministry of Defense](https://www.doha.directory/ministry-of-defense/i/694) and the [US Department of Defense](https://www.defense.gov/), but the matter remains under review by the respective legal departments, and no decision has been made."

[Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) have criticized the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) amid reports about their plans to accept a plane, saying that a gift of this magnitude would need congressional approval.

"[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) must seek [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/)’ consent to take this \$300 million gift from [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/). The [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/) is perfectly clear: no present “of any kind whatever” from a foreign state without [Congressional](https://www.congress.gov/) permission. A gift you use for four years and then deposit in your library is still a gift (and a grift)," [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Jamie Raskin (D-MD)](https://raskin.house.gov/), the top [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) on the [House Judiciary Committee](http://judiciary.house.gov/), [wrote in a post](https://x.com/RepRaskin/status/1921553946574782586) on [X](https://x.com/).

[Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Ritchie Torres (D-NY)](https://ritchietorres.house.gov/), called for an investigation into the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)'s plans to accept the plane, characterizing it as a "flying grift" that is "the most valuable gift ever conferred on a [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) by a foreign government."

"Rather than enforcing ethics, the [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) has affixed the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/)’s seal of approval to a transaction that flagrantly violates both the letter and the spirit of the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/)’s [Emoluments Clause](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S1-C7-1/ALDE_00000233/)," [Torres](https://ritchietorres.house.gov/) wrote in a letter to the head of the [Government Accountability Office](https://www.gao.gov/), the acting [Inspector General](https://www.dodig.mil/) of the [Defense Department](https://www.defense.gov/) and the acting director of the [Office of Government Ethics](https://www.oge.gov/).

[Axios](https://www.axios.com/) was the [first to report on Torres' letter](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/11/trump-qatar-plane-democrat-torres-investigation).

[Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Minority Leader](https://bioguide.congress.gov/search/bio/S000148) [Chuck Schumer](https://www.schumer.senate.gov/) similarly blasted [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), calling the plane an example of "foreign influence."

"Nothing says 'America First' like [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/), brought to you by [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/). It’s not just bribery, it’s premium foreign influence with extra legroom," [Schumer (D-NY)](https://www.schumer.senate.gov/). wrote in a post on [X](https://x.com/).

[Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Bernie Sanders I-VT)](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/), went even further, calling the move "corrupt" and "unconstitutional."

"I don’t know who needs to hear this, but NO, [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) cannot accept a \$400 million flying palace from the royal family of [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/). Not only is this farcically corrupt, it is blatantly unconstitutional," [Sanders](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/) wrote.

[Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) officials did not respond to a question from [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/) whether [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s acceptance of the plane could violate federal anti-bribery laws or the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/)’s [emoluments clause](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S9-C8-3/ALDE_00013206/) which bars the president and other federal officials from accepting gifts from foreign powers without the approval of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/).

[ABC News](abcnews.go.com/) reported that [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) and other [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) lawyers had determined that the acceptance of the plane was legally permissible if the [Qatari government](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) gifts it to the [Defense Department](https://www.defense.gov/) and it is later turned over to the [Trump Library Foundation](http://www.trumplibrary.gov/).

A former senior [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) official who spoke on condition of anonymity said that for the jet gift to violate federal laws barring the payment of bribes or gratuities to officials, the gift would have to be motivated by corrupt intent.

“Bribery requires a corrupt intent to influence an official act, i.e., a quid pro quo,” said the former official.
[Norm Eisen](https://www.brookings.edu/people/norman-eisen/), who served as special assistant to the president for ethics in the [Obama administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/), said that the gift violated the [emoluments clause](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S9-C8-3/ALDE_00013206/). [Eisen](https://www.brookings.edu/people/norman-eisen/), a longtime critic of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s ethics in office, and now a senior fellow at the [Brookings Institution](https://www.brookings.edu/), said that he is considering whether to challenge the transfer of the 747 in court.


“Suffice it to say that I and many others are looking,” said [Eisen](https://www.brookings.edu/people/norman-eisen/), who referred to the plane as “emoluments force one.”

[Eisen](https://www.brookings.edu/people/norman-eisen/) said that he believed the plane could not be accepted without the approval of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/).

“I do think there is a violation here. The problem is that you have what is functionally a direct gift to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/),” [Eisen](https://www.brookings.edu/people/norman-eisen/) added.

News of the plane comes ahead of the president’s [first foreign trip](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-snubs-traditional-allies-marks-gulf-power-first-foreign-trip-rcna204808) of his second term, in which he will travel to [Saudi Arabi this week and also make stops in the [United Arab Emirates](https://u.ae/) and [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/).

While in [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is expected to deliver a speech and then talk with [American troops](https://www.defense.gov/) at the [Al Udeid Air Base](https://www.afcent.af.mil/Units/379th-Air-Expeditionary-Wing/), according to two U.S. officials.

[Defense](https://www.defense.gov/) [Secretary Pete Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) is expected to accompany Trump during his stop at the base.

This is the second time [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has decided to visit [Saudi Arabia](https://my.gov.sa/) for his first foreign trip. He chose the same nation as his first stop in 2017, during his [first term](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/).
