title: "The $400,000,000 Qatari Boeing 747-8 Jumbo Jet Is a Trojan  Horse"
---


This [Qatari](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) is a Trojan Horse. The [Boeing](https://www.boeing.com/) [747-8](https://www.boeing.com/commercial/747-8) would have to be stripped down to the airframe to make sure that there are no listening devices or tracking devices embedded in [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s gift. Plus the airframe and electronics have to be hardened to be able to withstand an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) generated by a nuclear blast.

- How long would that take?
- How much would it cost?

## [Trump says he’ll accept a \$400m gift from Qatar — which funded Hamas](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-qatar-hamas-antisemitism-boeing-jet-gift-rcna206386)

*The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) attacked universities in the name of "protecting" Jews. But he's happy to receive a donation from [Qatar'](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/)s royal family — which backed [Hamas](https://hamasinfo.info/).*

 May 12, 2025, 7:41 PM EDT

By Anthony L. Fisher, Senior Editor, [MSNBC Daily](https://www.msnbc.com/)

“I could be a stupid person and say no, we don’t want a free plane,” [said the president of the United States](https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/-are-you-kidding-me-why-trump-accepting-luxury-jet-from-qatar-raises-security-questions-239367749859) about the [Boeing](https://www.boeing.com/) [747-8](https://www.boeing.com/commercial/747-8) which [the royal family](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-scrambles-defend-luxury-jet-qatar-ll-use-air-force-one-rcna206207) that rules [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) has offered as a gift.

There are obviously ethical, legal and constitutional issues — to say nothing of security concerns — with [President Donald Trump’s willingness to accept a \$400 million donation](https://www.msnbc.com/chris-jansing-reports/watch/ethics-of-this-is-highly-questionable-reaction-to-trump-defending-offer-of-luxury-jet-from-qatar-239390789997) from a Middle East petrostate with [tens of billions of dollars of business interests](https://usqbc.org/) in the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/). (It’s also more than a bit hypocritical, given that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) leads the party still obsessed with [Hunter Biden’s comparatively low-stakes shady overseas business dealings](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/hunter-biden-s-business-bad-look-here-s-how-fix-n1294057).) [Sen.](https://www.usa.gov/) [Bernie Sanders (I-VT)](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/), put it concisely [in a post on X](https://x.com/BernieSanders/status/1921643208343204053): “Not only is this farcically corrupt, it is blatantly unconstitutional. [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) must not allow this over-the-top kleptocracy to proceed.”

Perhaps less noticed is that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is poised to accept an exorbitant personal gift of a jumbo jet (meant to be used as [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/)) from a government that has provided substantial funding for the antisemitic, fascistic terror group [Hamas](https://hamasinfo.info/) about 100 days after he signed his “[Executive Order to Combat Anti-Semitism](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/additional-measures-to-combat-anti-semitism/).” (For years, [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) funded [Hamas](https://hamasinfo.info/) [with the support of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Israeli government](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-03-26/ty-article/.premium/prime-ministers-office-netanyahu-knew-that-hamas-had-diverted-4m-to-military-wing/00000195-cf86-d104-adfd-ffdf9e100000).)

> *[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is poised to accept an exorbitant personal gift from a government that has provided substantial funding for the antisemitic, fascistic terror group [Hamas](https://hamasinfo.info/).*

At the same time, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) continues to employ Kingsley Wilson as deputy press secretary for the [Department of Defense](https://www.defense.gov/), despite a recent social media record of posts [widely seen as antisemitic](https://www.thebulwark.com/p/shes-just-the-tip-of-the-trump-administration-racist-antisemitic-iceberg-kingsley-wilson-andrew-tate). And since [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) returned to the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), two powerful members of his inner circle have made “[“stiff-armed salutes”](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/steve-bannon-nazi-salute-cpac-rcna193167)” in front of big crowds and many cameras. Yet, the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has used the thinnest of pretexts to characterize activists as antisemitic, before then claiming they’re providing material support to [Hamas](https://hamasinfo.info/).

“To all the resident aliens who joined in the pro-jihadist protests, we put you on notice: come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you,” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said in a [White House fact sheet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-takes-forceful-and-unprecedented-steps-to-combat-anti-semitism/) that accompanied his [January antisemitism executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/additional-measures-to-combat-anti-semitism/). He also promised to “quickly cancel the student visas of all [Hamas](https://hamasinfo.info/) sympathizers on college campuses, which have been infested with radicalism like never before.”

Indeed, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s supposed war on antisemitism is his rationale for his war on universities and campus activism. Meanwhile, [pro-Israel](https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-851431) and [Trump-friendly media outlets](https://www.thefp.com/p/explosion-in-foreign-funding-for-american-universities) have published many articles and op-eds decrying what they say is the nefarious influence of Qatari billions on U.S. universities and [student activist groups](https://www.dailynews.com/2024/04/30/qatari-money-and-the-pro-palestinian-campus-takeovers/). (We’ll have to check back in later to see if they’re equally appalled by [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/)’s lavish funding of an [American president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s air travel.)

The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has tried to justify its deportation proceedings against Mahmoud Khalil, the green-card holder and spouse of a U.S. citizen who served as a mediator and spokesperson for a pro-[Palestinian](https://mofa.pna.ps/)/anti-[Israel](https://www.gov.il/) student activist group encamped last year on the campus of [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/), on the basis of fighting antisemitism. [Secretary](https://www.state.gov/biographies/marco-rubio/) of [State](https://www.state.gov/) [Marco Rubio](https://www.state.gov/biographies/marco-rubio/) later admitted Khalil had broken no laws, and the government has yet to provide any evidence that Khalil spread [Hamas](https://hamasinfo.info/) propaganda or participated in any harassment of [last month a federal judge ruled](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/palestinian-activist-khalil-mahmoud-can-fight-wrongful-detention-case-rcna203654) he can challenge the government’s deportation attempt in court.)

[NBC News reviewed over 100 pages of documents](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/governments-case-mahmoud-khalil-shaky-reliant-tabloid-accounts-review-rcna201254) the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) filed as evidence to back up its deportation efforts for Khalil, and found that “in some instances, the [government](https://www.usa.gov/) appears to be relying on unverified tabloid articles about Khalil. In others, the [government](https://www.usa.gov/)’s claims about him are clearly erroneous because timelines don’t match.”

> *Let’s call [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s so-called war on antisemitism what it is: [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s cudgel to attack his [perceived enemies](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-the-weaponization-of-the-federal-government/).*

In plain English, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s claims that they’re battling antisemitism are absurd. In fact, they are falsely likening protected speech with which they object (such as [co-signing an op-ed](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/12/us/where-things-stand-highest-immigration-cases-trump-hnk) critical of [Israel](https://www.gov.il/)’s conduct in the war in [Gaza](https://mofa.pna.ps/)) to a national security crisis requiring the most severe methods of enforcement, including denials of due process. The [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) is also cloaking its [brazen attempt to shake down universities](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-new-york-city-columbia-hochul-congestion-pricing-rcna197178) and bring them to heel politically by withholding federal funds in the name of “protecting” Jews.

As [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) put in the [antisemitism EO](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/additional-measures-to-combat-anti-semitism/)’s [fact sheet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-takes-forceful-and-unprecedented-steps-to-combat-anti-semitism/), “My promise to Jewish Americans is this: With your vote, I will be your defender, your protector, and I will be the best friend Jewish Americans have ever had in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).”

But in accepting a \$400 million personal gift from [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/), a country that funded the group that gleefully butchered Jews on Oct. 7, 2023, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has made an absolute mockery of his “war on antisemitism.” Let’s call [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s so-called war on antisemitism what it is: Trump’s cudgel to [attack his perceived enemies](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-the-weaponization-of-the-federal-government/).

*The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) tried to defend an apparent plan in which he’d get to use a luxury jet from the government of [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/). It didn’t go well.*

 May 12, 2025, 8:00 AM EDT

By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

In [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [first term](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/), the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) cultivated an unexpectedly amusing list of incidents related to airplanes. I actually [maintained a list](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-takes-aim-the-complexity-modern-airplanes-msna1203801), documenting a curious array of stories in which the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [suggested that F-35s are literally invisible](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-genuinely-seems-believe-f-35s-are-literally-invisible-n1131361), whined about [the complexity of piloting](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-takes-aim-the-complexity-modern-airplanes-msna1203801), referenced F-52s [that didn’t exist](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-boasts-about-norway-buying-fighter-jets-dont-exist) outside of video games, [complained to members of Congress](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trumps-preoccupation-airplanes-seems-little-weird) that the [emir](https://www.da.gov.kw/) of [Kuwait](https://www.cmgs.gov.kw/)’s plane was bigger than his, and ([among other things](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-takes-aim-the-complexity-modern-airplanes-msna1203801)) got caught [lying about Japan](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-touts-another-airplane-deal-doesnt-exist) buying U.S. fighter jets and [lying about Finland](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-says-finland-buying-us-fighter-jets-finland-disagrees) doing the same thing.

In his [second term](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), the news at the intersection of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and planes is far less funny. [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-administration-will-accept-luxury-jet-qatar-use-air-force-one-rcna206111):

> *The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) is preparing to accept a superluxury [Boeing](https://www.boeing.com/) [747-8](https://www.boeing.com/commercial/747-8) jumbo jet from the royal family of [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) as a gift to be used by [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) as the new [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/) for presidential travel until shortly before [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) leaves office, according to four sources familiar with the planning. Two of the sources also confirm that ownership of the plane will be transferred to the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) presidential library foundation once the president ends his second term.*

According to [a report from ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-administration-poised-accept-palace-sky-gift-trump/story?id=121680511), which was the first to break this story, [Attorney General](www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) and other [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) lawyers determined that the acceptance of the plane was legally permissible if the [Qatari](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) government gifts it to the [Defense Department](https://www.defense.gov) and it is later turned over to the [Trump Library Foundation](http://www.trumplibrary.gov/home).

This is notable for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is the [attorney general](https://www.justice.gov/)’s recent professional background: [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) used to work as a registered lobbyist for foreign clients, [including the government of Qatar](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/pam-bondi-tapped-trump-ag-still-haunted-controversies-rcna181609) — the same government that’s apparently preparing to reward [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) with a jet. (Soon after [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) made her the nation’s chief law enforcement official, [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) [also disbanded the FBI’s Foreign Influence Task Force](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/ag-pam-bondi-shutters-fbis-foreign-influence-task-force-rcna191221).)

It’s important to emphasize that the specific details of this arrangement are still coming into focus, and a spokesperson for [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/)’s government said that plans are not yet final. “The possible transfer of an aircraft for temporary use as [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/) is currently under consideration between [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/)’s Ministry of Defense and the [U.S. Department of Defense](https://www.defense.gov/), but the matter remains under review by the respective legal departments, and no decision has been made,” Ali Al-Ansari, [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/)’s Media Attaché to the U.S., [told Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/11/qatar-calls-jet-gift-trump-inaccurate-00341084).

The intended beneficiary of [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/)’s apparent generosity, however, characterized the developments as a “fact” in an overnight missive published to his social media platform.

“So the fact that the [Defense Department](https://www.defense.gov/) is getting a GIFT, FREE OF CHARGE, of a 747 aircraft to replace the 40 year old [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/), temporarily, in a very public and transparent transaction, so bothers the Crooked Democrats that they insist we pay, TOP DOLLAR, for the plane,” [Trump wrote](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114492082555622686). “Anybody can do that! The Dems are World Class Losers!!! MAGA”

So let me see if I have this straight. The [sitting American president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is eager to accept the largest foreign gift in the history of the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/), which he intends to keep after he exits the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), in [defiance of the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/investigation-trump-businesses-received-millions-foreign-governments-rcna132278) — a black-letter legal provision that the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) is on record dismissing as “[phony](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/21/donald-trump-mocks-constitution-emoluments-clause-phony/4055162002/).” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is prepared to welcome a foreign government’s largess, even as that same country [strikes private deals with the president’s family-run business](https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/trump-family-business-gulf-06792821?mod=hp_lead_pos1).

This entire arrangement was approved by the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)'s [attorney general](https://www.justice.gov/) — who worked as a well-paid lobbyist for that [same country](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/).

It’s against this backdrop that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wrote that his critics are “crooked.”

[Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Chris Murphy (D-CT)](https://www.murphy.senate.gov/), who’s spent months focusing on [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) corruption, described these developments as “[wildly illegal](https://bsky.app/profile/chrismurphyct.bsky.social/post/3lovwaqial22e).” In theory, [congressional](https://www.congress.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) — many of whom [seemed quite concerned about Qatari gifts to American universities](https://www.ft.com/content/d0a16f75-8b05-4ff9-b5f1-d473d7f5a704) in the recent past — could easily come to the same conclusions.

But it seems more likely that [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) [lawmakers](https://www.congress.gov/) will again shrug with indifference.

## [Pressed on corruption allegations against Trump, Karoline Leavitt offers pitiful defense](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/pressed-corruption-allegations-trump-karoline-leavitt-offers-pitiful-d-rcna206344)

*[White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) press secretary Karoline Leavitt pushed back against questions about the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s grifts. It was a predictable failure.*

May 12, 2025, 3:30 PM EDT
By Steve Benen

Even before a foreign government eager to curry favor with the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [offered Donald Trump a superluxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-scrambles-defend-luxury-jet-qatar-ll-use-air-force-one-rcna206207) those concerned with the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and corruption allegations focused their attention on [his outlandish meme coin gambit](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-controversial-meme-coin-contest-proves-predictably-profitable-p-rcna203293), which [has proved](https://apnews.com/article/trump-meme-coin-crypto-75063140a2223eb2698db7435dfaf5ac) to be quite lucrative, which appears to have created [influence opportunities](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/us/politics/auction-to-dine-with-trump-creates-foreign-influence-opportunity.html) that foreigners have reportedly [taken advantage of](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2025-trump-memecoin-foreign-crypto-traders/?embedded-checkout=true), and which has been fairly described as “the most brazenly corrupt thing a president has ever done.”

It’s against this backdrop that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is preparing to leave for the Middle East — his first major foreign trip of his second term — and a reporter asked [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) press secretary Karoline Leavitt whether the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) intends to meet with the [Trump Organization](https://www.trump.com%)’s business partners in the region. She apparently didn’t care for the line of inquiry.

“I think it’s frankly ridiculous that anyone in this room would even suggest that [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is doing anything for his own benefit,” Leavitt argued. “He left a life of luxury and a life of running a very successful real estate empire for public service, not just once but twice.”

Leavitt [went on to claim](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-press-conference-briefing-karoline-leavitt-may-9-2025/), with a straight face, that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) “has actually lost money for being [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) of the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/).”

In response to a question about the [meme coin](https://gettrumpmemes.com/) controversy, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s chief spokesperson added that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) “is abiding by all conflict of interest laws” and “has been incredibly transparent with his own personal financial obligations.”

So, a few things.

First, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) didn’t leave “a life of luxury.” He lives in a [presidential mansion](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), filled with a small army of people who call him “sir” and cater to his every whim, and spends most of his weekends at a [glorified country club in Florida](https://www.maralagoclub.com/), where he’s surrounded by sycophantic supporters who pay handsomely to hang out at a playground for the rich.

Second, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) oversaw a [real estate empire](https://www.trump.com/), but to call it “very successful” is, to put mildly, [a real stretch](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-schemes-fred-trump.html).

Third, given [the frequency with which Trump has tried to profit off the presidency](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-second-term-evidence-suggests-corruption-will-worse-not-better-rcna179589), I’d love for Leavitt to elaborate on why she considers this line of inquiry to be “ridiculous.”

Fourth, if the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) believes [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has been “incredibly transparent” with his finances, I have a follow-up question about the tax returns he has fought to keep secret.

Fifth, Leavitt might want people to believe that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) “is abiding by all conflict of interest laws,” but as she really ought to know, [presidents aren’t bound by the most serious conflict of interest laws](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-administration-pirro-pope-leo-uk-trade-immigration-live-updates-rcna204765/rcrd79129?canonicalCard=true).

Sixth, the idea that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) “has actually lost money” while serving as [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [appears to be at odds with reality](https://newrepublic.com/post/195088/karoline-leavitt-snaps-donald-trump-profiting-off-presidency).

To be sure, I don’t mean to sound unsympathetic. The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s [many grifts](https://paulwaldman.substack.com/p/what-trumps-corruption-will-cost) are the stuff of legend, and if I were his press secretary, I’d probably struggle to come up with a persuasive defense, too.

But if Leavitt believes her talking points are going to end the corruption discussion, she’s likely to be disappointed.

## [Qatar's jumbo jet gift is a deal for Trump, not the American people](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/qatar-trump-jet-gift-plane-corrupt-newsletter-rcna206330)

*[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) just put a "for sale" sign on U.S. foreign policy with [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/)'s jet gift.*

By Zeeshan Aleem, [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) Opinion Writer/Editor

In defending the gift of a [super luxury jumbo jet he’s preparing to receive from the royal family of Qatar](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-scrambles-defend-luxury-jet-qatar-ll-use-air-force-one-rcna206207) to use as [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/), [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) described it as a brilliant deal. Not for the American people, it isn’t.

The [Boeing](https://www.boeing.com/) [747-8](https://www.boeing.com/commercial/747-8) jet is so lavish it is estimated [to be worth around \$400 million](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-administration-poised-accept-palace-sky-gift-trump/story?id=121680511), and Jessica Levinson, a law professor at [Loyola](https://www.luc.edu/) [Law School](https://www.luc.edu/law/) and an [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) columnist, [has said](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-luxury-jet-gift-boeing-qatar-legal-concerns-explainer-2025-5) that “a gift of this size from a foreign government is unprecedented in our nation’s history.” Ali Al-Ansari, [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/)’s media attaché to the U.S., [said in a statement that](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-administration-will-accept-luxury-jet-qatar-use-air-force-one-rcna206111) that the deal is not final, as “the matter remains under review by the respective legal departments” of the two countries’ defense departments.

> *Contrary to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s insinuation that this is actually good for [Americans](https://www.usa.gov/), by accepting the luxe jet he’d be taking the [American public](https://www.usa.gov/) for a ride.*

After [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) objected to the planned transfer of the “flying palace” as unconstitutional and corrupt, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) suggested [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) ought to be in awe of his deal-making abilities. The real offense, he said, would be paying for the plane. “So the fact that the [Defense Department](https://www.defense.gov/) is getting a GIFT, FREE OF CHARGE, of a 747 aircraft to replace the 40 year old [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/), temporarily, in a very public and transparent transaction, so bothers the Crooked Democrats that they insist we pay, TOP DOLLAR, for the plane,” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [posted on Truth Social](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114492082555622686). “Anybody can do that! The Dems are World Class Losers!!! MAGA.”

Contrary to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s insinuation that this is actually good for [Americans](https://www.usa.gov/), by accepting the luxe jet he’d be taking the [American public](https://www.usa.gov/) for a ride. The [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/)’s [emoluments clause](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S1-C7-1/ALDE_00000233/) [prohibits public officeholders from receiving gifts from foreign states](https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/articles/article-i/clauses/759) without consent from [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/). There’s a simple reason for that: Those countries have their own interests that are separate from, and often at odds with, the interests of the [American public](https://www.usa.gov/). By accepting the jet, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) would be accepting a favor that could raise the potential for a reciprocal act that serves the interests of [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) instead of the [U.S.](https://www.usa.gov/)

“There is no question that any court that got to the merits would find a violation of the foreign emoluments clause,” [Jeff Hauser](https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/author/jeff-hauser/), executive director of the [Revolving Door Project](https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/ ), a public interest watchdog, told me.

[ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/), citing sources familiar with the plan, [reported](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-administration-poised-accept-palace-sky-gift-trump/story?id=121680511) that “[Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) and [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s top [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) lawyer David Warrington concluded it would be ‘legally permissible’ for the donation of the aircraft to be conditioned on transferring its ownership to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s presidential library before the end of his term.” (It’s worth noting, as my colleague Steve Benen [pointed out](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-scrambles-defend-luxury-jet-qatar-ll-use-air-force-one-rcna206207), that [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) “used to work as a registered lobbyist for foreign clients, [including the government of Qatar](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/pam-bondi-tapped-trump-ag-still-haunted-controversies-rcna181609).”)

But [Hauser](https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/author/jeff-hauser/) argued that its eventual donation to the library — where it appears plausible that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his family could continue to use the aircraft after his term ends — makes it no less of a violation of the [emoluments clause](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S1-C7-1/ALDE_00000233/). “You absolutely cannot use the existence of a nonprofit organization as a shield against political corruption,” [Hauser](https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/author/jeff-hauser/) said. “You can be corrupt on behalf of a charity.”

Think about it this way: Even if you re-gift a gift, it doesn’t change the fact that you received a gift. That applies even if [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) doesn’t use the jet after exiting the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). Of course the premise for this gift is to replace the aging aircraft in the [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/) fleet with an impressive new jet, as [Boeing’s contract to replace them has been delayed and plagued by cost issues](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-administration-poised-accept-palace-sky-gift-trump/story?id=121680511).

Avoiding conflict of interest matters beyond the corrupt back-scratching scenarios that they can set in motion. They also help maintain citizen trust in the government. A [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) who can only think of human interactions — including governance — as a series of private zero-sum transactions may not care about, or even understand, that.

It doesn’t matter whether [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) agreed to a specific quid pro quo behind closed doors. A free jumbo jet for [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/) is a big favor — and a hugely tangible and personal one at that. There would be no way to extricate that from the rapport between the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) going forward — it would be baked in as part of the bartering capital [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) has with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) in future instances when discussing everything from policy on [Iran](https://irangov.ir/) to [Israel](https://www.gov.il/) to natural gas deals. Moreover, other countries around the world will observe this and surmise that U.S. policy may be sold to the highest bidder.

*[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s plan to accept a luxury jet as a gift from the [Qatari](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) royal family has led to broad criticism — including from the MAGA faithful.*

May 13, 2025, 11:39 AM EDT / Updated May 13, 2025, 1:18 PM EDT

[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s plan to [accept a luxury jet from the Qatari royal family](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/qatar-trump-jet-gift-plane-corrupt-newsletter-rcna206330) has led to an uproar among ethics experts, [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) and [even some Republicans](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-struggles-defend-qatars-luxury-jet-gift-republicans-are-divided-rcna206447). But some of the loudest criticism has come from his most fervent MAGA supporters.

On his podcast Monday, The Daily Wire co-founder Ben Shapiro [pointed to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYBuphYtp6I&t=1907s) [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/)’s relationship with the [Muslim Brotherhood](https://www.ikhwanonline.com/article/) and [Hamas](https://hamasinfo.info/), saying that accepting a gift from the royal family is “not America First.”

If you want [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to succeed, this kind of skeezy stuff needs to stop.

“Is this good for [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), is it good for his agenda? Is it good for draining the swamp and getting things done? The answer is no, it isn’t,” Shapiro said. “It isn’t. If you want [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to succeed, this kind of skeezy stuff needs to stop.”

He added: “I think if we switched the names to Hunter Biden and [Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/), we’d all be freaking out on the right.”

Far-right influencer [Laura Loomer](https://www.loomered.com/), who has had [direct access to Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/way-too-early/watch/firing-of-nsa-chief-raises-concerns-about-laura-loomer-s-influence-236691013909), wrote a series of posts criticizing the gift.

“I love [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). I would take a bullet for him,” she [wrote on X](https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/1921615017138618439) on Sunday. “But, I have to call a spade a spade. We cannot accept a \$400 million ‘gift’ from jihadists in suits.”

[Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) host [Mark Levin](https://www.foxnews.com/person/l/mark-levin) shared [Loomer](https://www.loomered.com/)’s post, [adding](https://x.com/marklevinshow/status/1921701015516057967): “Ditto.”

[Loomer](https://www.loomered.com/), however, also tempered some of her criticism with effusive praise for the president. “It will be a stain, but he is still the best [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) of my lifetime,” she [wrote on X](https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/1921987426131837358) on Monday.

First [reported by ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-administration-poised-accept-palace-sky-gift-trump/story?id=121680511), the super luxury [Boeing](https://www.boeing.com/) [747-8 jumbo jet](https://www.boeing.com/commercial/747-8) — which is estimated to be valued at \$400 million — from Qatar is expected to be converted for use as Air Force One. The overhaul would take years and a potentially hefty price tag, along with a host of security concerns, according to aviation and intelligence experts who [spoke with NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/america-first-trump-qatar-luxury-jet-air-force-one-rcna206254).

Meanwhile, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has defended his decision to accept the plane, calling it “a great gesture from [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/)” and suggesting it was too good an offer to pass up on.

[“I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer,” he said Monday when pressed about the deal. “I mean, I could be a stupid person [and] say, ‘No, we don’t want a free, very expensive](airplane.’”)
