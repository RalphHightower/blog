## [The problem(s) with the White House’s defense of Trump’s scandalous crypto dinner](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/problems-white-houses-defense-trumps-scandalous-crypto-dinner-rcna208749)

*The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) came up with a handful of talking points to defend the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s meme coin scheme, but they were all unbelievable.*

When [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)' unveiled a [meme coin](https://gettrumpmemes.com/) a few days before his second inaugural, the ethical mess was obvious. The [Campaign Legal Center](https://campaignlegal.org/)’s [Adav Noti](https://campaignlegal.org/staff/adav-noti) [explained at the time](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/18/us/politics/trump-meme-coin-crypto.html), “It is literally cashing in on the [presidency](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) — creating a financial instrument so people can transfer money to the president’s family in connection with his office. It is beyond unprecedented.”

But when the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and his partners [launched a contest of sorts](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-extends-rare-white-house-opportunity-buy-meme-coin-rcna202855) last month, it took the story to a new level: Those interested in investing in [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [meme coin](https://gettrumpmemes.com/) — and by extension, giving the president money — were told they’d have a chance to win special access to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).

[Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Chris Murphy](https://www.murphy.senate.gov/) of [Connecticut](https://portal.ct.gov/) [said of the scheme](https://x.com/ChrisMurphyCT/status/1915138398714753437), “This isn’t [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) just being [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [coin scam](https://gettrumpmemes.com/) is the most brazenly corrupt thing a president has ever done. Not close.”,

The gambit proved predictably lucrative. [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/crypto/trumps-crypto-dinner-cost-1-million-seat-average-rcna207802) this week:

> *More than 200 wealthy, mostly anonymous crypto buyers are coming to [Washington](https://dc.gov/) on Thursday to have dinner with [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). The price of admission: \$55,000 to \$37.7 million. That’s how much the 220 winners of a contest to meet [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) spent on his volatile cryptocurrency token, [$TRUMP,](https://gettrumpmemes.com/) according to an analysis by the blockchain analytics company [Nansen](https://www.nansen.ai/). The top [$TRUMP](https://gettrumpmemes.com/) coin holders at a specific time — determined by the dinner’s organizers — secured a seat.*

The dinner [nevertheless happened](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/crypto/trumps-meme-coin-dinner-tuxedos-luxury-suvs-protesters-rcna208647) at a [Trump-owned property](https://www.trumpnationaldc.com/) in [Virginia](https://www.virginia.gov/) on Thursday night, and it was [described by MSNBC’s Chris Hayes](https://bsky.app/profile/allinwithchris.bsky.social/post/3lpsgr657lc2y) as “the Met Gala of presidential pay-for-play.” Chris added that the dinner was “the most brazen act of corruption by a president in our lifetimes, probably in a century, possibly ever.”

For its part, the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [hasn’t said who attended the event](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-administration-congress-salt-medicaid-tariffs-doge-live-updates-rcna207504/rcrd80149?canonicalCard=true) or exactly how much money ended up in the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s pockets. Hours before the dinner, however, press secretary Karoline Leavitt did take some time to offer her most detailed defense of the scandalous arrangement to date.

The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s chief spokesperson was asked, for example, whether [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was using the gathering to enrich himself. Instead of answering directly, [Leavitt said](https://bsky.app/profile/factpostnews.bsky.social/post/3lps2ax3grk2z) the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) was re-elected “because he was a successful businessman.” The problem with this, of course, was (a) she didn’t answer the question; (b) he [wasn’t a successful businessman](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-schemes-fred-trump.html); and (c) there’s no evidence to suggest [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s private-sector background contributed to his successful 2024 candidacy.

At the same briefing, Leavitt also argued that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was attending the crypto dinner in his “[personal time](https://bsky.app/profile/factpostnews.bsky.social/post/3lps2ax3fsc2z),” which made even less sense, given that [presidents](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) while in office don’t have the luxury of simply taking off the [presidential hat](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and acting as a private citizen for a while. Ethical norms and legal standards always apply to the [nation’s chief executive](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), especially when interacting with those eager to give them financial rewards.

But I was especially interested in Leavitt’s third point: [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s assets, she insisted, are in a “blind trust” managed by his adult sons, which necessarily mitigates potential ethical conflicts.

This almost resembles a credible point, but there’s a problem: [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s “trust” isn’t actually “blind.”

When the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s [first term began](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/), many urged the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) to avoid ethical quandaries by utilizing a blind trust, [but Trump refused](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/03/us/politics/donald-trump-business.html). After he was elected to a second term, he did transfer assets [into a trust](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/20/business/trump-media-donald-trump-trust.html) controlled by his eldest son, but to call it “blind” is to stretch the definition to an unreasonable degree.

Indeed, [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) spoke to [Dennis Kelleher](https://bettermarkets.org/team/dennis-m-kelleher/), the chief executive of [Better Markets](https://bettermarkets.org/), a nonprofit that pushes for more transparency on Wall Street, who emphasized the family connection. “This is not a blind trust with an independent trustee, where people can have confidence that the conflicts of interest are in fact removed,” [he explained](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/20/business/trump-media-donald-trump-trust.html).

In other words, after having plenty of time to come up with a defense for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s meme coin scheme, the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) came up with a handful of talking points, and all three fell apart rather quickly.

All things considered, that’s not too surprising: Defending the indefensible isn’t easy.
