## [Trump's jet from Qatar is worrisome. What he’s giving in return is troubling.](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-qatar-jet-corruption-concessions-rcna206761)

*The only thing that unites the policies the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has announced on his Middle East tour so far is that they are exactly what the Gulf states wanted.*

May 14, 2025, 2:36 PM EDT / Updated May 14, 2025, 3:16 PM EDT
By Chris Hayes

This is an adapted excerpt from the [May 13](https://www.msnbc.com/all) episode of “All In with Chris Hayes.”

For decades, going back to [Ronald Reagan](https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/), when an [American president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) makes their first visit to a foreign nation, they almost always go to [Canada](https://www.canada.ca/). It makes sense: They’re our top trading partner; we share a language and a very long border. But in 2017, [Donald Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/donald-trump) did not do that.

Instead, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) went to the oil-rich kingdom of [Saudi Arabia](https://my.gov.sa/), where he joined in [laying hands on a glowing orb](https://www.nbcnews.com/video/watch-president-trump-touch-glowing-counterterrorism-orb-950400579770). During that trip, he also forged a close friendship with the nation’s crown prince, [Mohammed bin Salman](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-recent-interactions-saudis-crown-prince-matter-rcna146395), who would later invest \$2 billion in a business owned by [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s son-in-law, against [the advice of his own economic experts](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/10/us/jared-kushner-saudi-investment-fund.html).

> *It’s worth noting that before that announcement, [Syria](https://egov.sy/)’s leader offered to build a [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [Tower](https://www.trump.com/) in Damascus.*

Eight years later, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is president again. This time around, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), once again, decided he wasn’t going to [Canada](https://www.canada.ca/), the country he [openly wants to annex](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-canada-tariff-war-annex-trudeau-rcna195882). Instead, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) went back to the Middle East, landing in [Riyadh](https://www.alriyadh.gov.sa/), [Saudi Arabia](https://my.gov.sa/), on Tuesday, with plans to visit [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) and the [United Arab Emirates](https://u.ae/) next.

The [Saudis](https://my.gov.sa/), the [Qataris](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) and the [Emiratis](https://u.ae/) all clearly understood the assignment. Take the crown prince: He greeted [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) on the tarmac and rolled out the [royal purple carpet](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/watch/-unprecedented-spectacle-trump-given-royal-treatment-by-his-new-close-friends-in-saudi-arabia-239488581712).

Not only did the [Saudis](https://my.gov.sa/) welcome [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) with open arms, but they also welcomed his co-president, [Elon Musk](https://www.nbcnews.com/video/elon-musk-meets-saudi-crown-prince-mohammed-bin-salman-239445573787). However, [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) wasn’t the only billionaire on the trip. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and the crown prince joined forces to open a [U.S.](https://www.usa.gov/)-[Saudi](https://my.gov.sa/) investment forum for [big-money players](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-boasts-saudi-arabian-investments-are-hard-take-seriously-rcna206766?icid=latestpost_bot) from the two nations, with speakers from U.S. firms like [Citigroup](https://www.citigroup.com/global), [BlackRock](https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual) and [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/).

The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) claims [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) “secured \$600 billion in deals with the [Saudi government and firms](https://my.gov.sa/).” But, [according to The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/world/middleeast/trump-saudi-economic-forum.html), “the details the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) provided were vague and totaled less than half that number. And a closer look at the projects the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) provided shows several were already in the works before [Mr. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) took office.” But [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) claimed a big win, and so the \[[president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)] responsible for the [“Muslim ban”](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/muslims-me-know-evil-power-trump-s-dead-muslim-ban-n1255017) posed onstage in front of a massive [Saudi flag](https://my.gov.sa/) and was applauded.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) had some other big gifts ready, too. The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) announced a [\$142 billion arms agreement](https://www.reuters.com/world/us-saudi-arabia-have-discussed-riyadhs-potential-purchase-f-35-jets-2025-05-13/) to provide the [Saudis](https://my.gov.sa/) with [U.S. weapons and defense contractors](https://www.defense.gov/) to maintain them. He also announced that he plans to [lift sanctions on Syria](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-says-us-will-end-sanctions-syria-works-deepen-diplomatic-ties-sa-rcna206471), which [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said was at the behest of the [Saudis](https://my.gov.sa/). “Oh, what I do for the crown prince,” he said from the stage.

While that announcement was a good one and those sanctions on [Syria](https://egov.sy/) should be dropped, we should not drop them as a favor to the \[[Saudi crown prince](https://my.gov.sa/)] who threw \$2 billion at your son-in-law.

It’s also worth noting that before that announcement, [Syria](https://egov.sy/)’s leader offered to build a [Trump Tower](https://www.trump.com/) in Damascus] and said he would give the U.S. mineral rights contracts in his country, according to several sources familiar with the efforts who [spoke with Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-tower-damascus-syria-seeks-charm-us-president-sanctions-relief-2025-05-11/).

Mideast diplomacy is one of the most complicated, fraught areas of American foreign policy, and out of the gate, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is basically just going down a list of policies that the [Saudis](https://my.gov.sa/) and their allies wanted.

Policywise, some of those concessions are better than others; corrupt processes can sometimes accidentally create a decent policy here and there. But they’re not policies so much as presents for his overseas buddies, and, in return, those buddies are giving him what he wants.

Which brings us, of course, to [the Qatari jumbo jet](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/problems-trumps-free-luxury-jet-qatar-s-not-actually-free-rcna206706). A special [Boeing](https://www.boeing.com/) [747-8](https://www.boeing.com/commercial/747-8) that has been called a “palace of the sky” and a “flying mansion.” A luxury item worth \$400 million and gifted to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) by the [Qatari royal family](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) over the weekend.

It is full of leather, gold and burl wood accents. It sports at least three lounges, two bedrooms, nine bathrooms, five galleys and a private office. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is palpably stoked out of his shoes about this thing, like a very rich kid on Christmas morning getting the world’s most expensive toy.

Accepting this jet would be the most shockingly corrupt act by a [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) in the history of the [presidency](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). It violates not only the spirit of [the Constitution](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/12/nx-s1-5395696/qatar-trump-plane-gift-ethics), but literally the text. However, according to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), not taking it would be “stupid.”

It seems the only thing that unites the policies [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has announced on his Middle East tour so far is that they are exactly what the Gulf states wanted.

> *The Gulf states don’t have huge armies, but they have a lot of oil and a lot of money, and they use it to extend their geopolitical dominance.*

It makes sense, this is the place [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) feels most at home because these countries get [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) in a way they never got any other [American president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). That’s because this [American president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [openly admires despots](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/maddow-trump-admiration-for-dictators-reflects-shared-goal-of-power-control-218961477503) and envies what they have.

The Gulf states that are hosting [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) understand that. They recognize he is not there for [330 million Americans](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). He is there for himself, and they are there to indulge him. It’s not because [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is a unique force of nature. He is not special; he is just easy.

He’s not even the first foreign leader to be gifted a [747-8](https://www.boeing.com/commercial/747-8) by the [Qataris](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/). [Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-45550537) got a half-billion-dollar jumbo jet back in 2018.

But this is the thing: The Gulf states have been doing this forever. They don’t have huge armies, but they have a lot of oil and a lot of money, and they use it to extend their geopolitical dominance. That only goes so far with a traditional, law-abiding [American](https://www.usa.gov/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/). However, with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), a man not just willing but thirsty to trade on the trappings of the office that [American voters](www.fec.gov/) bestowed on him, the sky is the limit.
