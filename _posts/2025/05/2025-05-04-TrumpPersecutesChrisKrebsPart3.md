By Steve Benen

It’s probably fair to say that [Christopher Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/) is not a household name, but inside the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), he’s immediately recognized. [Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/) led the [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)](https://www.cisa.gov/) during [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s first term, which meant he was responsible for combatting foreign interference in our elections and preventing attacks.

[Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/) earned bipartisan praise for his work, and after the 2020 election cycle, The [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/)’s [David Ignatius](https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/david-ignatius/) [noted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trump-and-his-supporters-are-discovering-how-hard-it-is-to-sabotage-election-results/2020/11/17/96d37bbe-290e-11eb-9b14-ad872157ebc9_story.html), “When the history books about this election are written, [Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/) will be one of the heroes.”

The day [Ignatius](https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/david-ignatius/)’ column was published, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [fired Krebs](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-fires-one-heroes-2020-telling-truth-n1248089) — not because he’d done anything wrong but because the president wanted him to go along with his lies about the election results. When [Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/) instead told the truth, he was shown the door.

Four and a half years later, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) issued an order that not only described [Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/) as a “significant bad-faith actor who weaponized and abused his Government authority” — a baseless claim the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) made while abusing his government authority — it also directed [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) and the [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/) [to investigate Krebs’ work and activities](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/authoritarian-fashion-trump-orders-probes-two-ex-officials-defied-rcna200574).

Even by 2025 standards, it was an outrageous abuse, [which the White House has struggled to defend](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-house-struggles-defend-trumps-orders-targeting-officials-defied-rcna201500).

Three weeks after the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) signed a [first-of-its-kind executive order](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/authoritarian-fashion-trump-orders-probes-two-ex-officials-defied-rcna200574) targeting a former official for defying him, [Time magazine asked Trump a good question](https://time.com/7280114/donald-trump-2025-interview-transcript/): “You recently signed memos calling for an investigation of [Chris Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/), a top cybersecurity official in your first term. Isn’t that, though, what you accused [Joe Biden] of doing to you?” The president responded:

> *I think [Chris Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/) was a disgrace to our country. I think he was — I think he was terrible. By the way, I don’t know him. I’m not — I don’t think I ever met him. ... I know very little about [Chris Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/), but I think he was very deficient.*

Right off the bat, there’s the obvious problem that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) thinks the former cybersecurity leader — who, again, did literally nothing wrong during his work in [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s own administration — is “a disgrace,” despite the inconvenient detail that the president knows “very little” about him.

But just as notable was the degree to which the president ignored the underlying question that [Time magazine](https://www.time.com/) was right to ask: For all of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s hysterical conspiracy theories about the [Biden administration](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) “weaponizing” federal law enforcement, it was [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) who signed an [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/addressing-risks-from-chris-krebs-and-government-censorship/) that directed the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) to go after one of his perceived political foes.

Asked to defend his own tactics, the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) said his perceived enemy was “a disgrace to our country.” By that reasoning, can any [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) sic the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) after those they hold in contempt? Wouldn’t that necessarily create the kind of conditions that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his party have claimed to be against?

As for [Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/) himself, the former official has said very little about the [president’s executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/addressing-risks-from-chris-krebs-and-government-censorship/), though he has spoken out against the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s policy agenda in his area of expertise.

As [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/chris-krebs-speaks-cuts-trump-cuts-digital-defense-rcna203427), [Krebs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherckrebs/) received a warm welcome from industry professionals at the [RSA Conference](https://www.rsaconference.com/usa) in [San Francisco](https://www.sf.gov/), a cybersecurity conference, where he criticized the [second Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) for its repeated cuts to cybersecurity employees, contractors and programs.

“Cybersecurity is national security. We all know that, right? That’s why we’re here. That’s why we get up every morning and do our jobs. We are protecting everyone out there. And right now, to see what’s happening to the cybersecurity community inside the [federal government](https;//www.usa.gov/), we should be outraged. Absolutely outraged.”
