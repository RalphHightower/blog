## [Trump order targets ActBlue, Democratic fundraising platform, sparking authoritarian fears](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-signs-order-targeting-democrats-fundraising-platform-sparking-au-rcna202970)

*Sometimes, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s authoritarian tactics are subtle. His new offensive against the [ActBlue](https://secure.actblue.com/) donation platform is far more overt.*

April 25, 2025, 9:45 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

For many years, [Trumpian](https://www.gop.com/) officials looked at [ActBlue](https://secure.actblue.com/) with envy. The more the donation platform positioned itself as an effective and successful tool that fueled the [Democratic Party](https://www.democrats.org/)’s fundraising, the more [GOP insiders](https://www.gop.com/) wished they had something comparable.

But more recently, [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) didn’t see [ActBlue](https://secure.actblue.com/) just as a tool to emulate, they also saw it as a target to attack.


On [Capitol Hill](https://www.congress.gov/), [GOP lawmakers](https://www.gop.com/) have [launched dubious investigations](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/us/politics/actblue-house-investigation.html) into [ActBlue](https://secure.actblue.com/). Online, prominent [Trumpian](https://www.gop.com/) voices such as [Elon Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) have [peddled a variety of allegations](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/us/politics/actblue-house-investigation.html) intended to undermine public confidence in the platform.

It was against this backdrop that [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) took matters one step further, signing an executive memorandum aimed at investigating his political opposition’s infrastructure. [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-expected-sign-memo-targeting-act-blue-rcna202673):

> *The memorandum directs [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) to ‘investigate allegations regarding the unlawful use of online fundraising platforms to make “straw” or “dummy” contributions or foreign contributions to political candidates and committees, and to take appropriate action to enforce the law.’ It specifically names [ActBlue](https://secure.actblue.com/) as an online fundraising platform being used ‘to improperly influence American elections.’*

[Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Jamie Raskin](https://raskin.house.gov/) of [Maryland](https://moss-maryland-cdn.nicusa-gl.com/Pages/default.aspx), the ranking member on the [House Judiciary Committee](http://judiciary.house.gov/), issued a compelling written statement soon after the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s move, describing it as “a striking development.”

“[Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [pocketed millions](https://oversightdemocrats.house.gov/news/press-releases/oversight-democrats-release-report-proving-trump-pocketed-millions-from-at-least) in unlawful payments from foreign governments during his first term, his [Administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) shut down a probe into whether his campaign received an illegal and urgent [$10 million bribe](https://oversightdemocrats.house.gov/news/press-releases/oversight-democrats-launch-investigation-allegations-trump-doj-covered-10), and foreign nationals are spending millions on [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-owned cryptocurrencies right now in [apparent hopes of buying their way out](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/28/business/crypto-mogul-trump-coins-civil-fraud-charges/index.html) of federal criminal investigations through undisclosed payments. The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [Administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has also systematically dismantled crime-fighting efforts at the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) aimed at foreign corruption of our politics and actually announced its indifference to violations of the [Foreign Corrupt Practices Act](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-fraud/foreign-corrupt-practices-act).

“So it’s rich indeed for [Americans](https://www.usa.gov/) to read now that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has launched a big initiative to ‘crack down on foreign influence’ in [American](https://www.usa.gov/) politics with one purpose — crippling the fundraising platform of his political opponents.

“Today’s [presidential](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) decree targeting the campaign infrastructure of the [Democratic Party](https://www.democrats.org/) with precisely zero evidence of wrongdoing is the kind of edict you’d expect from a power-mad dictator in a Banana Republic. This [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), with his approval ratings underwater and sinking like a stone, is desperately seeking to undermine his political opposition by cutting off their access to funding.”

Ideally, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) would respect the independence of the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/), especially on matters related to criminal investigations, and further still on matters related to criminal investigations of his political opponents. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), however, continues to take truly radical steps — to target his perceived foes and to attack his opponents’ infrastructure.

It comes on the heels of the [Trumpian](https://www.gop.com/) [also directing](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-house-struggles-defend-trumps-orders-targeting-officials-defied-rcna201500) his politically aligned [attorney general](https://www.democrats.org/) to investigate a former administration official who refused to go along with his conspiratorial lies in the wake of his 2020 election defeat.

I’m also reminded of a recent [New York Times analysis](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/us/politics/trump-republicans-attack-democrats-actblue.html) — published weeks before the directive related to [ActBlue](https://secure.actblue.com/) — about the scope and direction of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s efforts against [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) politics.

Executive actions intended to cripple top [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) law firms. Investigations of [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) fund-raising and organizing platforms. Ominous suggestions that nonprofits aligned with [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) or critical of [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) should have their tax exemptions revoked. [Mr. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his allies are aggressively attacking the players and machinery that power the left, taking a series of highly partisan official actions that, if successful, will threaten to hobble [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/)’ ability to compete in elections for years to come.

Sometimes, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s authoritarian tactics are subtle. The new offensive against [ActBlue](https://secure.actblue.com/) was far more overt.
