~~It was the best of times,~~ it was the worst of times, ~~it was the age of wisdom,~~ it was the age of foolishness, ~~it was the epoch of belief,~~ it was the epoch of incredulity, ~~it was the season of Light,~~ it was the season of Darkness, ~~it was the spring of hope,~~ it was the winter of despair, ~~we had everything before us,~~ we had nothing before us, ~~we were all going direct to Heaven,~~ we were all going direct the other way—in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.

There were a king with a weak jaw, with orange hair, and a spray-on orange tan and a queen with a fair face with a vacant gaze with ice-cold blood, but surgically enhanced knockers, on the throne of the United States; There was a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of The Resistance; there was a king with a smirking mouth and a queen with a frozen gaze, presiding over the empire of exceptionalism. In both nations, the stewards of privilege and power—safeguarding their storerooms of favors and fortunes—declared, with unshaken certainty, that the hierarchy of human worth was inscribed for eternity..

It was the year of Our Lord two thousand and twenty-five. Spiritual revelations were conceded to the wind, as were laws, at that dark period, as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were made for the swallowing up of Washington DC and California. Even the Cock-lane ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its messages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally deficient in originality) rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to the United States and The Resistance, from a congress of American subjects in America: which, strange to relate, have proved more important to the human race than any communications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane brood.

## [Trump’s claim that Afrikaners are fleeing genocide in South Africa is an outrageous lie](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-afrikaners-apartheid-refugees-genocide-rcna206660)

*If the [Episcopal Church](https://www.episcopalchurch.org/) had agreed to resettle [South African](https://www.gov.za/) Boers, then it would have elevated a lie that will affect refugee resettlement for years to come.*

May 16, 2025, 9:15 PM EDT
By The [Rev. Nontombi Naomi Tutu](https://www.naomitutu.com/), Priest Associate at [All Saints’ Church Atlanta](https://allsaintsatlanta.org/)

The combination of the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [granting expedited refugee status to white South Africans](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/white-south-africans-refugees-trump-rcna205894) and the [Episcopal Church](https://www.episcopalchurch.org/) [the Episcopal Church ending a 40-year partnership](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/episcopal-church-trump-white-south-africans-rcna206537) with the [federal government](https://www.usa.gov/) rather than help resettle fake refugees leaves me with contradictory feelings.

[As an Episcopal priest](https://www.naomitutu.com/) and a dual citizen of the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) and [South Africa](https://www.gov.za/), I am proud of the [Episcopal Church](https://www.episcopalchurch.org/) for standing up and speaking out about [the U.S. government’s lies of a white “genocide” in South Africa](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/white-south-africans-arrive-us-refugees-protected-trumps-carve-rcna206373). In equal measure, I am devastated that [the work our church has done for decades](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/episcopal-church-says-wont-help-resettle-white-south-africans-rcna206409), giving hope and care to people forced to leave their homelands, is ending because of white supremacy and Christian nationalism.

I am devastated that the work our church has done for decades is ending because of white supremacy and Christian nationalism.

Our parish, [All Saints’ Atlanta](https://episcopalatlanta.org/church/all-saints-atlanta/?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=16784364371&gbraid=0AAAAACkZWBKGQZqLkddHf61Bq0hSSucaw&), has a vibrant refugee ministry, and this year, in response to the end of government funding for refugee resettlement, the parish committed to continue to support the refugee families the government had abandoned and to actually increase the number of families it’s supporting. The mission of showing “hospitality to strangers, for by so doing [some people have shown hospitality to angels](https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-2.htm)” (Hebrews 13:2) or treating “the stranger who sojourns with you as a native among you … for you were strangers in the land of Egypt” ([Leviticus 19:33-34](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Leviticus%2019%3A34)), is central to our faith community.

The denomination’s decision to end a decadeslong partnership with the [U.S. government](https://www.usa.gov/) that offered support to people fleeing oppression and war was not taken lightly. But I applaud the [Episcopal Church](https://www.episcopalchurch.org/) answering the call and standing up to powers and principalities that oppress and call it freedom and lie as they call it truth.

If the [Episcopal Church](https://www.episcopalchurch.org/) had agreed to resettle [South African](https://www.gov.za/) [Boers](https://www.gov.za/), then it would have elevated a lie that will affect refugee resettlement for years to come. If white [South Africans](https://www.gov.za/) are experiencing genocide, then it is truly an enviable genocide. White [South Africans](https://www.gov.za/), who are about 7% of the country’s population, [own about 75% of South Africa’s farmland](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/05/12/afrikaner-refugees-arrive-dulles-trump/) and control [a great majority](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/2/21/are-white-afrikaners-at-risk-in-south-africa-not-really-most-say) of [senior corporate positions](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-48123937)
As I write this article, I realize how angry I am:. Our Palestinian brothers and sisters would likely be happy if they had control over 30% of their ancestral land.

The [U.S. government](https://www.usa.gov/)’s sudden concern with the possibility of land confiscation without compensation leads me to ask: Where was this outrage in the 1970s, ’80s and ’90s when Black communities were forcibly evicted from their ancestral home and their land given to whites? There are Black communities who had their land taken by the apartheid government on the eve of our first democratic election in 1994 and are now expected to pay market rates for the land that was stolen from them. And yet the U.S. is granting refugee status to those who benefited from apartheid? Where is the logic?

The [Episcopal Church](https://www.episcopalchurch.org/) has taken a moral stand. The [Boers](https://www.gov.za/) who arrived on [U.S. soil](https://www.usa.gov/) this week are not refugees. They are white people using their privilege to leap over legitimate refugees who have been waiting to escape political repression and life-threatening situations. In welcoming them and expediting access to the [U.S.](https://www.usa.gov/), the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has proved its racist bona fides. It has stopped the asylum of [Afghans](https://moi.gov.af/) and [Iraqis](http://mop.gov.iq/) who fought alongside [American troops](https://www.centcom.mil/) only to resettle a group that views the loss of absolute domination of [South Africa](https://www.gov.za/)’s Black majority as oppression.

Earlier this year, I said to some friends that the deafening silence of [Americans](https://www.usa.gov/) after masked men abducted a young woman off the streets of [Cambridge](https://www.cambridgema.gov/), [Massachusetts](https://www.mass.gov/), was proof to me that people in this country do not recognize a police state when they see it. The insufficient outrage to the resettlement of [49 Afrikaners](https://www.gov.za/), who landed with huge amounts of luggage, tells me that we as a country are not willing to face up to the reality that white supremacy is now the order of the day. The [Episcopal Church](https://www.episcopalchurch.org/) has spoken. When will the rest of the country step up and say enough is enough?

- angry that people who abused and oppressed my people for generations and are still benefiting from that abuse and oppression are claiming victim status
- angry that the country that offered me an education (at [Berea College](https://www.berea.edu/) in [Kentucky](https://kentucky.gov/)) when my native land had closed those doors to me is now selling the myth of oppressed whites in [South Africa](https://www.gov.za/)
- angry that there is not a more forceful reaction to the U.S. attempting to change and degrade the definition of what it means to flee your home in fear.

As a Black woman, I’m glaringly aware of how my anger will be perceived. I considered tempering it. But this is a holy anger.

And if I silence it, I harm not only myself but all those who are harmed by this grotesque falsification of what it means to be a refugee. I would be untrue to thousands of Black, Coloured, Asian and white [South Africans](https://www.gov.za/), forced into exile by the evil that was apartheid. It would be untrue to the millions of Palestinians who have been refugees for generations, especially poignant as May 15 is 77 years since the Nakba. Untrue to those all over the world forced to flee their homes and communities because of violence and oppression.

So I speak today, as the [Reverend Nontombi Naomi “Angry Black Woman” Tutu](https://www.naomitutu.com/). Praying that other people of faith will be angry too and that they channel that anger into actions for the common good. Far too often, we as the human family look back at injustices and evil and say, “We did not know.” Future generations will not allow us to make that claim about our inaction in 2025.

## [Trump's white South African refugee plan is not going over with the Episcopal Church](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/episcopal-church-trump-white-south-africans-rcna206537)

*The [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)'s embrace of white [South Africans](https://www.gov.za/) as refugees, while rejecting so many others, paints a disturbing portrait of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s approach to Christianity.*

May 14, 2025, 3:53 PM EDT

By [Guthrie Graves-Fitzsimmons](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guthriegf/), vice president of programs and strategy, [Interfaith Alliance](https://interfaithalliance.org/)

[Fifty-nine white South Africans](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-south-africans-arrive-trump-admin-ends-temporary-protected-statu-rcna206496) arrived in the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/)[^101] this week aboard a U.S.-chartered plane to [be granted refugee status](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/white-south-africans-refugees-trump-rcna205894). Upon the group's arrival, [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) stated that the members of the ethnic minority called [Afrikaners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaners), who ruled the country during apartheid, have been subject to “a genocide” and that “white farmers are being brutally killed, and their land is being confiscated” by the [South African government](https://www.gov.za/). No evidence has been found to back up those claims.

[^101]: @RalphHightower: They could be [Elon Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) kids. His [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk) states that he has at least fourteen kids.

Meanwhile, also this week, the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) [revoked Temporary Protected Status](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/12/temporary-protected-status-afghans-00342250) for [Afghans](https://moi.gov.af/).

A seemingly “whites only” refugee program is a morally bankrupt inversion of the Christian call to welcome the stranger and aid the most vulnerable

The move has been denounced by many — of particular note, the [Episcopal Church in the United States](https://www.episcopalchurch.org/)’ presiding Bishop Sean W. Rowe, who in a [letter to his congregation](https://religionnews.com/2025/05/12/episcopal-church-ends-refugee-resettlement-citing-moral-opposition-to-resettling-white-afrikaners/) sent Monday said the church’s migration ministry would not help resettle the [Afrikaners](https://www.gov.za/), as requested by the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/), “[i]n light of our church’s steadfast commitment to racial justice and reconciliation and our historic ties with the [Anglican Church of Southern Africa](https://anglicanchurchsa.org/).” Rowe announced that, after nearly 40 years, they will stop receiving federal grants to resettle refugees by September.

> *A seemingly “whites only” refugee program is a morally bankrupt inversion of the Christian call to welcome the stranger and aid the most vulnerable.*

The [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s response to the [Episcopal Church](https://www.episcopalchurch.org/) was swift and vicious. [Vice President JD Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) [called the decision](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/0f3bd8fc.streaklinks.com/CbLlQLD4uNYadTZY_gmCJC7K/https*3A*2F*2Fx.com*2FJDVance*2Fstatus*2F1922033366716612966__;JSUlJSUl!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!p-v07Tj1HTDucTipia8vy6KykDu3CSiE4ct-qKVTs8TZ043AZikKTS3sDtKlXa57gLZ2-uua5nwbQhHpqSGzaQ$) “crazy” and [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) deputy press secretary [Anna Kelly said](https://religionnews.com/2025/05/12/episcopal-church-ends-refugee-resettlement-citing-moral-opposition-to-resettling-white-afrikaners/) it “raises serious questions about its supposed commitment to humanitarian aid.”

Yet there is nothing “crazy” about the [Episcopal Church](https://www.episcopalchurch.org/)’s decision to not aid the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s abhorrent spin on refugee resettlement.

“If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor,” the late [Archbishop Desmond Tutu](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1984/tutu/biographical/) of [South Africa](https://www.gov.za/) once said. “If an elephant has its foot on the tail of a mouse and you say that you are neutral, the mouse will not appreciate your neutrality.”

“[Desmond Tutu](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1984/tutu/biographical/) was a teacher to us, and we were a partner to him,” [Bishop Rowe told NPR](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/0f3bd8fc.streaklinks.com/CbLlQK-hIU-ayB3WzwLUaXZ1/https*3A*2F*2Fwww.npr.org*2F2025*2F05*2F13*2Fnx-s1-5395887*2Fafrikaners-refugees-trump-episcopal-church__;JSUlJSUlJSU!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!p-v07Tj1HTDucTipia8vy6KykDu3CSiE4ct-qKVTs8TZ043AZikKTS3sDtKlXa57gLZ2-uua5nwbQhEbKmMwyg$). “In fact, his young seminarian, I remember driving him around [Washington, D.C.](https://dc.gov/), during one of his visits. We have strong ties to that country and to that fight against racism and the apartheid regime. And the idea that we would be somehow resettling [Afrikaners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaners) at this point over other refugees, who have been vetted and waiting in camps for months or even years, is unfathomable to us.”

Plus, the [Episcopal Church](https://www.episcopalchurch.org/) isn’t ending its ministry with migrants — just its ties to the [federal government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). “We can’t be partners with the [federal government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) at this point, but we will continue our work and our advocacy to the most vulnerable,” Rowe said. “That’s what Jesus calls us to, to care for the poor and the most vulnerable.”

In Matthew 25, Jesus tells his followers that nations will be judged by how they treat the hungry, the stranger, those needing clothes, the sick, and those imprisoned.

A policy favoring white [South Africans](https://www.gov.za/) over all other refugees is not a policy aligned with Jesus’ teaching. In [South Africa](https://www.gov.za/), whites [make up about 7% of the population](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/05/09/afrikaner-refugees-south-africa-white-trump/) of the population, yet account for about three-quarters of land ownership. Recent attempts at land reform and addressing systemic racial injustice in [South Africa](https://www.gov.za/) are not “genocide,” as [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) claims — and not giving into this rewiring of refugee resettlement is a faithful response by Christians.

This isn’t the first time the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has singled out a particular denomination for rebuke.

*[Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has largely closed the doors to the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) for refugees — with one big exception for [Afrikaners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaners).*

May 13, 2025, 11:21 AM EDT
By Steve Benen

It wasn’t long after [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s second inaugural when the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and his team announced a dramatic reversal on refugee admissions: In practically every instance, the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) said, the doors to the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) would be closed to refugees[^211].

[^211]: @RalphHightower: As long as they're white...

The policy apparently included one striking exception. [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/white-south-africans-arrive-us-refugees-protected-trumps-carve-rcna206373):

> *American officials welcomed a group of 59 white [South Africans](https://www.gov.za/) at [Washington Dulles International Airport](https://www.flydulles.com/) on Monday afternoon, in a ceremony greeting them as refugees under the argument that they are fleeing discrimination and racially based violence in their home country. The newly arrived people are from the ethnic minority of [Afrikaners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaners), the group of whites who ruled [South Africa](https://www.gov.za/) during apartheid. The dozens that came Monday, including families with young children, arrived via a flight chartered by the [State Department](https://www.state.gov/).*

[U.S. Deputy Secretary](https://www.state.gov/deputy-secretary-of-state/) of [State](https://www.state.gov/) [Christopher Landau](https://www.state.gov/deputy-secretary-of-state/) and [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/) [Deputy Secretary](https://www.dhs.gov/person/troy-edgar) [Troy Edgar](https://www.dhs.gov/person/troy-edgar) were personally on hand to welcome the [Afrikaners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaners) to [American soil](https://www.usa.gov/).

While refugees from many countries have been forced to wait literally for years for resettlement assignments, the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) adopted an expedited process for white [South Africans](https://www.gov.za/), who were bumped to the front of the line, skipping past many who’ve been undergoing extensive vetting. [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) reported last week, “While the program remains suspended for refugees across the world, such as [Congolese families](https://gouvernement.cg/) in refugee camps and [Rohingya](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/01/1159316) seeking safety, white [South Africans](https://www.gov.za/) were processed much faster than is normal for these cases.”

Asked why refugees fleeing war, famine and natural disasters are being turned away while the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) welcomes [Afrikaners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaners), [White House](https://www.https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the white [South Africans](https://www.gov.za/) “[faced racial persecution](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/09/us/trump-news/d5650587-1088-58f5-a686-84a553363fd1?smid=url-share)” under a recent land expropriation law. The president added that those being welcomed “[happen to be white](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3loy7tumn2w2e).”

Apparently, the public is supposed to believe that it’s simply a coincidence that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is blocking refugees from entering the U.S. except for a group of white people.

[Episcopal Migration Ministries](https://episcopalmigrationministries.org/), which has maintained a decadeslong partnership with the government on refugee resettlements, apparently isn’t buying it. [The Associated Press reported](https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-refugees-white-afrikaners-us-trump-52024f6d86fca76cfe7460a9f9bc6110), “The [Episcopal Church](https://www.episcopalchurch.org/)’s migration service is refusing a directive from the federal government to help resettle white [South Africans](https://www.gov.za/) granted refugee status, citing the church’s longstanding ‘commitment to racial justice and reconciliation.’”

Making matters worse is the companion bookend: On the same day the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) welcomed white [South Africans](https://www.gov.za/), it also announced that it’s [ending temporary protected status for Afghans](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-[administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)/live-blog/trump-[administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)-us-china-tariffs-drugs-saudi-arabia-live-updates-rcna206058/rcrd79215?canonicalCard=true) after determining that conditions in the Taliban-led country “no longer meet the statutory requirements” for the designation.

If there’s a defense for the White House’s competing standards for those in need of rescue, I can’t think of it.

## [These brave Afghans helped the U.S. after 9/11. Now the U.S. wants to deport them.](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/brave-afghans-911-trump-administration-deportation-rcna204229)

*The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) claims [Afghans](https://moi.gov.af/) in the U.S. under temporary protected status no longer meet the threshold for protection.*

May 3, 2025, 8:54 AM EDT

By [Muhammad Tahir](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/expert/muhammad-tahir/), nonresident senior fellow at [The Atlantic Council](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/)'s [Eurasia Center](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/region/europe-eurasia/)

It was a bitterly cold evening when I arrived in Kabul on a U.N.-chartered flight in early 2002. The city, like much of [Afghanistan](https://moi.gov.af/), was in turmoil. The trauma of [Al Qaeda’s deadly Sept. 11, 2001, attack on the United States](https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/sept-11-anniversary-unity-ground-zero-rcna170675) was still raw, [U.S. forces](https://www.centcom.mil/) were advancing from the north, the Taliban was retreating south, and ordinary [Afghans](https://moi.gov.af/) in the middle were torn between fear and the first flickers of hope.

> *‘You’re finally here,’ an old man outside [Bagram Airfield](https://factcheck.afp.com/doc.afp.com.39VY2ZP) told me. ‘Maybe now my grandchildren will have a future.’*

U.S. airstrikes lit up the sky, but it was [Afghans](https://moi.gov.af/) opposed to the Taliban who moved on the ground — risking everything to help the U.S. pursue justice for 9/11. Armed with little more than battered rifles and unshakable hope, they stepped into the fight, driven by a belief in a future they were told the U.S. would help them build.

“You’re finally here,” an old man outside [Bagram Airfield](https://factcheck.afp.com/doc.afp.com.39VY2ZP) told me. “Maybe now my grandchildren will have a future.”

In the weeks that followed, I reported from the front lines as Kabul bureau chief for [Turkey](https://www.turkiye.gov.tr/)’s [Ihlas News Agency](https://iha.news/). Embedded with [U.S. troops](https://www.centcom.mil/), I watched [Afghan civilians](https://moi.gov.af/) — students, farmers, former resistance fighters — step forward to support the [U.S. mission](https://www.centcom.mil/).

Now, the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) is telling [Afghans who resettled in the U.S.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/was-tortured-taliban-will-sent-back-afghanistan-rcna200628) after helping it fight the Taliban that they’ve got to self-deport by May 20 — back to a Taliban-controlled [Afghanistan](https://moi.gov.af/). “If [America](https://www.usa.gov/) can’t honor its word to those who bled for it,” a retired U.S. colonel told me, “why would anyone trust us again? This isn’t just immigration policy — it’s a test of our moral credibility. And we’re failing.”

The [Afghans](https://moi.gov.af/) who aided the U.S. during its war in [Afghanistan](https://moi.gov.af/) weren’t just interpreters or cultural advisers; they were bridge builders in every sense. They helped restore America’s credibility, one act of courage at a time. With their support, the Taliban was driven out — temporarily, at least — and a U.S.-backed government took root.

“Ahmad” (not his real name) was one of them. Now living in the U.S. under [temporary protected status](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/RS20844) (TPS), he spent years serving in nearly every role imaginable — interpreter, logistics officer, project coordinator — all under the [U.S. flag](https://www.usa.gov/).

“It felt like our chance to shape a better future,” he told me. But that future came at a steep cost. “As the Taliban turned to guerrilla tactics, we were constantly on the move — new cities, new homes. I tried to stay invisible, but the threats never left.”

The [Afghans](https://moi.gov.af/) who aided the U.S. during its war in [Afghanistan](https://moi.gov.af/) weren’t just interpreters or cultural advisers — they were bridge builders in every sense.

Another [Afghan](https://moi.gov.af/) — I’ll call him Murtaza — was a former English teacher I met in 2002 who stepped up. He used his language skills as an interpreter, serving alongside U.S. forces in some of [Afghanistan](https://moi.gov.af/)’s most dangerous terrain.

Murtaza and Ahmad survived countless attacks — but [more than 241,000 others didn’t](https://interactive.aljazeera.com/aje/2021/afghanistan-visualising-impact-of-war/index.html), including 71,000 civilians and [2,442 U.S. troops](https://www.centcom.mil/). Still, like many [Afghans](https://moi.gov.af/), they remained committed to the U.S. mission.

That loyalty was shattered on Aug. 15, 2021, when the Taliban seized Kabul and [U.S. forces withdrew in chaos](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/biden-s-afghanistan-withdrawal-timeline-reveals-risky-obsession-deadlines-n1278057), leaving thousands of allies behind. Branded as traitors, many [Afghan](https://moi.gov.af/) partners went into hiding before eventually making it to third countries — holding on to the promise of U.S. resettlement.

Murtaza, like thousands of others, has spent three and a half years stranded in a third country. His [special immigrant visa](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/small-fraction-america-s-afghan-allies-made-it-out-afghanistan-n1278141) (SIV) — once a lifeline to safety in the U.S. — remains stalled, and the [State Department’s recent decision](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/trumps-suspension-refugee-program-puts-afghans-others-potential-danger-rcna188744) to suspend the refugee admissions program has indefinitely blocked his path.

That decision now leaves him — and thousands like him — facing imminent deportation, as their stay in their host countries was based on the promise that they’d eventually resettle in the U.S.

With the [SIV](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/special-immigrants) pipeline already clogged, the [U.S. Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/) [announced April 11](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/11/g-s1-59939/trump-afghanistan-tps-kristi-noem-dhs) that it’s terminating [TPS](https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/temporary-protected-status) for more than 9,000 [Afghans](https://moi.gov.af/) like Ahmad who are in the U.S. They’ve been given that May 20 deadline to leave or face removal. Some were coldly notified of their fate by email.

Both men — one stuck abroad, the other inside the U.S. — face the same looming betrayal.

These aren’t undocumented migrants. They were vetted and approved for resettlement after risking their lives alongside American forces in our longest war. Now, with the deadline fast approaching, they’re being told: Get out — or face consequences.

We’re not just abandoning them; we’re throwing them to the wolves.

In doing so, we’re not just abandoning them; we’re throwing them to the wolves.

“[TPS](https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/temporary-protected-status) exists for moments like this,” said Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of [Global Refuge](https://www.globalrefuge.org/act-now/?gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAADrWcLM_sIOwVbXmQ_LiYHUk062tl&), a refugee rights group. “It’s designed to protect people whose return would place them in serious danger.” She added, “Make no mistake: [Afghanistan](https://moi.gov.af/) remains under Taliban control, gripped by humanitarian crisis, economic collapse and brutal extremism.”

The latest [situation update](https://unama.unmissions.org/sites/default/files/unama_update_on_human_rights_in_afghanistan_january-march_2025.pdf) from the [U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA)](https://unama.unmissions.org/), covers January to March 2025 and delivers the grim assessment that the Taliban continues to hunt, torture and execute former government officials and military personnel.

Women are completely erased from public life, and girls remain barred from school beyond sixth grade. LGBTQ [Afghans](https://moi.gov.af/) face public floggings, and religious minorities endure constant persecution.

On Jan. 23, the [International Criminal Court](https://web.prod.icc-cpi.int/) [issued arrest warrants for Taliban leader Haibatullah Akhundzada](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/01/1159366) and his chief justice for alleged crimes against humanity, specifically gender persecution.

Is this the regime the U.S. expects our [Afghan](https://moi.gov.af/) allies to return to?

Ahmad, who’s still in the U.S. but is staring down the May 20 deportation deadline, is terrified. “It’s not just about me,” he said. “If I’m forced to leave, my family loses our only income — and given our political background, my entire extended family could be in danger.”

The [Trump administration claims Afghans in the U.S. under TPS no longer meet the threshold for protection](https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/5245561-dhs-deportation-protections-tps-afghan-refugees-cameroon-noem/). But Ahmad firmly rejects that. “Safety isn’t just about bullets,” he said. “It’s the right to live with freedom and dignity, the right to learn, to travel, to speak. I invite [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to see what life actually looks like on the ground.”

This isn’t just about [Afghans](https://moi.gov.af/) — it’s about every partner we’ll need tomorrow.

This isn’t just about [Afghans](https://moi.gov.af/) — it’s about every partner we’ll need tomorrow. If we abandon them today, future allies in [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/), [Taiwan](https://www.taiwan.gov.tw/) or anywhere else in the world will think twice about cooperating with the U.S.

“This is cruel and chaotic,” [Shawn VanDiver](https://afghanevac.org/bio-vandiver), president of [#AfghanEvac](https://afghanevac.org/), a nonprofit supporting the resettlement of [Afghan](https://moi.gov.af/) allies in the U.S., [told NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/11/g-s1-59939/trump-afghanistan-tps-kristi-noem-dhs). [VanDiver](https://afghanevac.org/bio-vandiver), a military veteran, said, “It shatters everything [America](https://www.usa.gov/) claimed to stand for when we promised not to abandon our allies.”

There’s still time to do the right thing.
[Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) must reinstate [TPS](https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/temporary-protected-status), clear the [SIV](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/special-immigrants) backlog and pass the [Afghan Adjustment Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4627/text), which would give [Afghans](https://moi.gov.af/) who helped the U.S. in Afghanistan [a path to permanent, legal residency](https://refugees.org/re-introduction-of-afghan-adjustment-act-provides-chance-to-fulfill-promise-to-afghan-allies/). People like Ahmad and Murtaza didn’t just work for us; they fought for us, bled for us, believed in us.

We owe them more than empty promises. We owe them protection. We owe them our word.

Because if we fail them now, we’re not just abandoning Ahmad, Murtaza and thousands like them — we’re telling the world that [America](https://www.usa.gov/)’s word means nothing.
