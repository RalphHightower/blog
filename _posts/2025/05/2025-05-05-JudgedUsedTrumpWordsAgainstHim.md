title: "Trump’s ‘Fact Sheets’ Boomeranged 🪃 Against Him In a Court Room That Targeted a Law Firm"

## [A judge used Trump’s own words to expose his real agenda](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/judge-used-trumps-words-expose-real-agenda-rcna204827)

*The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and those around him just had to brag — and [Howell](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/senior-judge-beryl-howell) turned their own words against them.*

May 5, 2025, 12:59 PM EDT

By [Ray Brescia](https://www.albanylaw.edu/faculty/faculty-directory/raymond-brescia), professor of law, [Albany Law School](https://www.albanylaw.edu/)

In issuing [a permanent injunction](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-executive-order-perkins-coie-unconstitutional-howell-rcna204601) halting the enforcement of [President Donald Trump’s executive order](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/donald-trump-executive-order-perkins-coie-rcna196030) targeting the law firm [Perkins Coie](https://perkinscoie.com/), [U.S. Judge Beryl Howell ruled](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.278290/gov.uscourts.dcd.278290.185.0.pdf) that the order singled out [Perkins Coie](https://perkinscoie.com/) based on the content of its speech and actions. To conclude that the order infringed upon the [First Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/) rights of [Perkins Coie](https://perkinscoie.com/) and its clients, [Howell](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/senior-judge-beryl-howell) unsurprisingly relied upon the text of the [president’s order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-perkins-coie-llp/) and the [accompanying “fact sheet”](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/03/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-adresses-risks-from-perkins-coie-llp/) from his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/). But she also did something else far more unusual: [Howell](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/senior-judge-beryl-howell) used [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s subsequent agreements with other firms — and his boasts about them — as evidence against his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/).  

[Trump’s order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-perkins-coie-llp/) limited [Perkins Coie](https://perkinscoie.com/)’s lawyers access to government buildings, revoked their security clearances and ordered federal agencies to terminate contracts with the firm. One of [Perkins Coie](https://perkinscoie.com/)’s claims in its lawsuit was that this punishment was in retaliation for stances that the firm has taken over the years, including its representation of Hillary Clinton and her 2016 campaign for president. The firm showed that it already had lost clients as a result of the order and that it was likely to lose many more if the judge did not permanently halt the enforcement of the order.

> *It wasn’t just the deals that caught the judge’s eye, but the president and his staff’s bragging about the agreements.*

In determining whether [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s order was “unconstitutional retaliation for plaintiff’s [First Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/) protected activity,” [Howell](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/senior-judge-beryl-howell) accepted the firm’s allegations that it had lost business — which the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) did not contest. But she also went further, turning to the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s deals with other law firms.

For [Howell](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/senior-judge-beryl-howell), a critical element in her assessment of whether the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s actions were punitive and retaliatory was the fact that those who entered into agreements with the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) were spared similar harms, with the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) either refraining from issuing orders punishing those firms or even withdrawing orders previously issued. 

[withdrawing orders previously issued](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-[administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)/legal-community-shaken-powerful-law-firm-paul-weiss-trump-rcna197490)
It wasn’t just the deals that caught the judge’s eye, but the [president] and his staff’s bragging about the agreements. For [Howell](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/senior-judge-beryl-howell), this made it evident that the punishment was the very point of the White House’s actions in the first place.

In addition to noting the White House’s promotion of the agreements with these other firms, [Howell](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/senior-judge-beryl-howell) also referenced the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s own statements on the issue. She quoted, for example, his remarks at an event in early April:

> *Have you noticed that lots of law firms have been signing up with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)? $100 million, another $100 million, for damages that they’ve done. But they give you $100 million and then they announce, ‘We have done nothing wrong.’ And I agree, they’ve done nothing wrong. But what the hell, they’ve given me a lot of money considering they’ve done nothing wrong.*

[Howell](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/senior-judge-beryl-howell) also cited [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and adviser Stephen Miller’s remarks during the signing of an order targeting the law firm [Susman Godfrey](https://www.susmangodfrey.com/). At the event, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) asked Miller to share the value of free legal work secured from the deals with other law firms. “The numbers are adding up. We’re going to be close to a billion soon,” Miller replied. “As to the [Susman EO](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/addressing-risks-from-susman-godfrey/) he had just signed,” [Howell](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/senior-judge-beryl-howell) wrote, “[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) then said, ‘this one, we’re just starting the process with this one.’”

Although the “precise terms of these deals” are “somewhat fuzzy,” [Howell](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/senior-judge-beryl-howell) wrote, “what is clear is that the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) White House has publicly touted the negotiated deals reached with various law firms, and equally clear is that those deal-making firms have been spared, or had revoked, an Executive Order targeting them.” The government’s promotion of those deals provided [Howell](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/senior-judge-beryl-howell) with further evidence that [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was clearly singling out firms for retribution based on whether they entered agreements with the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) or not. 

Perhaps [Judge Howell](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/senior-judge-beryl-howell)’s decision would have been the same had [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) not trumpeted certain firms bending the knee to him. But this [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and this [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) could not help themselves. They just had to brag — and [Howell](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/senior-judge-beryl-howell) used their own words against them.
