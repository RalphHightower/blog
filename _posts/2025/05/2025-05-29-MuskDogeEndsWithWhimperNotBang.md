## [The White House’s failed Elon Musk experiment ends with a whimper, not a bang](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-houses-failed-elon-musk-experiment-ends-whimper-not-bang-rcna209709)

*Was Musk's tenure in the Trump administration consequential? Yes. Was it a success story? No.*

May 29, 2025, 10:51 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

Nearly nine months ago, then-candidate [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [delivered a new campaign pledge](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-eyes-musk-efficiency-panel-possible-second-term-rcna169936): If elected to a second term, the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) said, he’d appoint [conspiratorial billionaire Elon Musk](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/13/politics/elon-musk-social-security-conspiracy-theory-what-matters) to lead some kind of government “efficiency” panel.

To hear the then-candidate tell it, the endeavor would work miracles: The [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)-led commission, [Trump boasted](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-eyes-musk-efficiency-panel-possible-second-term-rcna169936), would save taxpayers “trillions of dollars,” and implement “an action plan to totally eliminate fraud and improper payments within six months.”

For a variety of reasons, none of this made any sense. Indeed, [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) lacked any meaningful experience in auditing, federal budgeting, or even the basics of how the federal government worked. Trump nevertheless won a second term; his top campaign donor was rewarded with a White House office; and the [Department of Government Efficiency](https://www.doge.com/) got to work.

In December, [Punchbowl News](https://punchbowl.news/)’ [Jake Sherman](https://punchbowl.news/author/jake-sherman/) spoke to a senior [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) aide [who predicted](https://punchbowl.news/archive/12524-am/) that the entire endeavor would likely end in “disaster.” As [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) officially exits, the prediction appears relevant anew. [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/elon-musk-leaves-trump-white-house-rcna209636):

> *[Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk), the billionaire [Tesla CEO](https://www.tesla.com/) whom [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) enlisted to cut waste in the federal government, started offboarding from his role Wednesday, a [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) official told [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/), a day after he criticized a [Republican bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text) to fund much of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s agenda. Two sources later confirmed to [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/) that [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)’s more than 114-day long tenure as a special government employee officially concluded Wednesday evening.*

His departure came immediately on the heels of [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) [expressing public disappointment](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/doge/elon-musk-says-disappointed-domestic-policy-bill-break-trump-rcna209157) with the [Republican Party](https://www.gop.com/)’s inaptly named [“One Big Beautiful Bill Act,”](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text) despite the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s obsessive efforts to rally public and partisan support for the far-right legislation.

It’s easy to make the case that [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)’s tenure was, among other things, enormously consequential. The [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [megadonor](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) and the [DOGE](https://www.doge.com/) operation he helped lead leave behind a legacy of shattered institutions, weakened public services, and fired civil servants who did nothing but serve their country well. The damage [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) did from his powerful position made people’s lives worse — both in the [United States](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/05/elon-musk-made-your-life-worse/) and abroad.

But as important as those truths are, it’s equally easy to conclude that [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) represents a failed experiment in governing.

Amid all the hype and tumult, it’s easy to lose sight of the [billionaire](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)’s original remit: [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) tasked [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) with leading an effort to cut spending and make the federal government more efficient.

As [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) slinks away, the facts prove that [government spending went up, not down](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/05/09/us-federal-deficit-increases-doge/), not down, during his tenure, and his [DOGE](https://www.doge.com/) endeavor [made the government less efficient, not more](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/03/21/doge-government-efficiency-federal-workers/), not more.

Even the “savings” he claimed to have found proved [illusory, misleading, or both](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/us/politics/doge-musk-contracts-trump.html).

[Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)’s goals went unmet. His promises went unfulfilled. He promised one set of results but delivered the opposite.

All the while, [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) managed to inflict incredible harm to his public reputation and his private businesses, which leaves a stain that will be difficult to wash off.

As for the future, the [billionaire](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)’s [political influence will linger](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/elon-musk-political-spending-trump-influence-rcna208261) — I doubt very much that we’ve heard the last of [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) as a partisan operator — and there are lingering questions about [the ton of personal data he was able to scoop up](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/us/politics/elon-musk-trump-doge-tesla.html) about the [American public](https://www.usa.gov/) while he was a part of the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/).

But at least for now, if [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) walks away from this experiment with his head held high, his satisfaction is misplaced.
