title: "Trump Crime Family: Qatari Jumbo Jet Bribe Is a Great Deal For Trump (Free). Expensive For America to Rebuild to Air Force One Standards & Not a Trojan Horse"

## [Qatar's jumbo jet gift is a deal for Trump, not the American people](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/qatar-trump-jet-gift-plane-corrupt-newsletter-rcna206330)

*[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) just put a "for sale" sign on U.S. foreign policy with [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/)'s jet gift.*

May 13, 2025, 6:00 AM EDT / Updated May 13, 2025, 8:59 AM EDT

By Zeeshan Aleem, [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) Opinion Writer/Editor

In defending the gift of a [super luxury jumbo jet he’s preparing to receive from the royal family of Qatar](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-scrambles-defend-luxury-jet-qatar-ll-use-air-force-one-rcna206207) to use as [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/), [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) described it as a brilliant deal. Not for the American people, it isn’t.

The [Boeing](https://www.boeing.com/) [747-8](https://www.boeing.com/commercial/747-8) jet is so lavish it is estimated [to be worth around \$400 million](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-administration-poised-accept-palace-sky-gift-trump/story?id=121680511), and Jessica Levinson, a law professor at [Loyola](https://www.luc.edu/) [Law School](https://www.luc.edu/law/) and an [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) columnist, [has said](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-luxury-jet-gift-boeing-qatar-legal-concerns-explainer-2025-5) that “a gift of this size from a foreign government is unprecedented in our nation’s history.” Ali Al-Ansari, [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/)’s media attaché to the U.S., [said in a statement that](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-administration-will-accept-luxury-jet-qatar-use-air-force-one-rcna206111) that the deal is not final, as “the matter remains under review by the respective legal departments” of the two countries’ defense departments.

> *Contrary to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s insinuation that this is actually good for [Americans](https://www.usa.gov/), by accepting the luxe jet he’d be taking the [American public](https://www.usa.gov/) for a ride.*

After [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) objected to the planned transfer of the “flying palace” as unconstitutional and corrupt, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) suggested [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) ought to be in awe of his deal-making abilities. The real offense, he said, would be paying for the plane. “So the fact that the [Defense Department](https://www.defense.gov/) is getting a GIFT, FREE OF CHARGE, of a 747 aircraft to replace the 40 year old [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/), temporarily, in a very public and transparent transaction, so bothers the Crooked Democrats that they insist we pay, TOP DOLLAR, for the plane,” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [posted on Truth Social](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114492082555622686). “Anybody can do that! The Dems are World Class Losers!!! MAGA.”

Contrary to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s insinuation that this is actually good for [Americans](https://www.usa.gov/), by accepting the luxe jet he’d be taking the [American public](https://www.usa.gov/) for a ride. The [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/)’s [emoluments clause](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S1-C7-1/ALDE_00000233/) [prohibits public officeholders from receiving gifts from foreign states](https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/articles/article-i/clauses/759) without consent from [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/). There’s a simple reason for that: Those countries have their own interests that are separate from, and often at odds with, the interests of the [American public](https://www.usa.gov/). By accepting the jet, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) would be accepting a favor that could raise the potential for a reciprocal act that serves the interests of [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) instead of the [U.S.](https://www.usa.gov/)

“There is no question that any court that got to the merits would find a violation of the foreign emoluments clause,” [Jeff Hauser](https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/author/jeff-hauser/), executive director of the [Revolving Door Project](https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/ ), a public interest watchdog, told me.

[ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/), citing sources familiar with the plan, [reported](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-administration-poised-accept-palace-sky-gift-trump/story?id=121680511) that “[Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) and [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s top [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) lawyer David Warrington concluded it would be ‘legally permissible’ for the donation of the aircraft to be conditioned on transferring its ownership to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s presidential library before the end of his term.” (It’s worth noting, as my colleague Steve Benen [pointed out](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-scrambles-defend-luxury-jet-qatar-ll-use-air-force-one-rcna206207), that [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) “used to work as a registered lobbyist for foreign clients, [including the government of Qatar](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/pam-bondi-tapped-trump-ag-still-haunted-controversies-rcna181609).”)

But [Hauser](https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/author/jeff-hauser/) argued that its eventual donation to the library — where it appears plausible that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his family could continue to use the aircraft after his term ends — makes it no less of a violation of the [emoluments clause](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S1-C7-1/ALDE_00000233/). “You absolutely cannot use the existence of a nonprofit organization as a shield against political corruption,” [Hauser](https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/author/jeff-hauser/) said. “You can be corrupt on behalf of a charity.”

Think about it this way: Even if you re-gift a gift, it doesn’t change the fact that you received a gift. That applies even if [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) doesn’t use the jet after exiting the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). Of course the premise for this gift is to replace the aging aircraft in the [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/) fleet with an impressive new jet, as [Boeing’s contract to replace them has been delayed and plagued by cost issues](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-administration-poised-accept-palace-sky-gift-trump/story?id=121680511).

Avoiding conflict of interest matters beyond the corrupt back-scratching scenarios that they can set in motion. They also help maintain citizen trust in the government. A [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) who can only think of human interactions — including governance — as a series of private zero-sum transactions may not care about, or even understand, that.

It doesn’t matter whether [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) agreed to a specific quid pro quo behind closed doors. A free jumbo jet for [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/) is a big favor — and a hugely tangible and personal one at that. There would be no way to extricate that from the rapport between the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) going forward — it would be baked in as part of the bartering capital [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) has with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) in future instances when discussing everything from policy on [Iran](https://irangov.ir/) to [Israel](https://www.gov.il/) to natural gas deals. Moreover, other countries around the world will observe this and surmise that U.S. policy may be sold to the highest bidder.
