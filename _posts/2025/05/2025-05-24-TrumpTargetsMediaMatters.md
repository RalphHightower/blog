## [Trump admin regulators launch investigation into Media Matters, adding to pattern](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-admin-regulators-launch-investigation-media-matters-adding-patte-rcna208780)

*If it seems as if there have been a lot of new federal investigations into [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) and their allies lately, it’s not your imagination.*

May 23, 2025, 1:22 PM EDT
By Steve Benen

[Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has [an odd habit of demanding investigations](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/targeting-perceived-foes-trump-keeps-pushing-federal-investigations-rcna208543) into all kinds of people and entities whom he perceives as political foes, indifferent to whether his targets have actually done anything wrong. Often, the [presidential calls](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) amount to meaningless chest-thumping and [go ignored](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/targeting-perceived-foes-trump-keeps-pushing-federal-investigations-rcna208543).

But it’s important to remember that many of the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s political antagonists are, in fact, facing the kind of investigations that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has in mind. [The New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/technology/ftc-investigates-media-matters.html):

> *The [Federal Trade Commission](https://www.ftc.gov/) on Wednesday opened an investigation into [Media Matters](https://www.mediamatters.org/), a liberal advocacy organization that has published research on hateful and antisemitic content on [X](https://x.com/), according to two people familiar with the inquiry. The regulator said in a letter sent to the organization that it was investigating the group, which is aligned with [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/), over whether it illegally colluded with advertisers, according to the people.*

It’s worth emphasizing for context that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s top campaign donor and [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) adviser, [Elon Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk), sued the progressive media watchdog a couple of years ago, raising similar allegations, and as the [Times](https://www.nytimes.com/)’ article noted, the [FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/)’s regulators “also asked [Media Matters](https://www.mediamatters.org/) to turn over all the documents it had produced or received from [X](https://x.com/) in that litigation.”

[Media Matters](https://www.mediamatters.org/)’ president, [Angelo Carusone](https://www.mediamatters.org/about-us/leadership), said in a statement, “Right-wing media figures holding key posts and abusing government power to target critics are two hallmarks of the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/). Threats won’t work, our mission continues.” (The commission, meanwhile, did not comment.)

Time will tell what, if anything, comes of the investigation, but if you’re thinking it seems as if there have been a lot of these kinds of probes lately, it’s not your imagination.

The public has learned in recent weeks that the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) — led by a [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) whose [second-term “revenge tour”](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/donald-trump-revenge-tour-rcna201791) has been unsubtle — is also investigating and/or prosecuting a variety of [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) officials and candidates, including [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [LaMonica McIver](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/rep-lamonica-mciver-arrested-ice-new-jersey-alina-habba-rcna207334?icid=previouspost_bot) of [New Jersey](https://www.ny.gov/), former [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) [Gov.](https://www.governor.ny.gov/) [Andrew Cuomo](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/cuomo-investigation-trump-justice-department-doj-rcna208209), [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) [Attorney General](https://ag.ny.gov/) [Letitia James](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-doj-prosecute-new-york-ag-letitia-james-rcna201554) and [New Jersey](https://www.ny.gov/) [Gov.](https://www.nj.gov/governor/) [Phil Murphy](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/alina-habba-new-jersey-phil-murphy-matthew-platkin-immigration-rcna200902).

This dovetails with the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) directing the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) to go after [Christopher Krebs](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/addressing-risks-from-chris-krebs-and-government-censorship/), who led the [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency]; which came on the heels of Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) pressing the [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/) to investigate [Miles Taylor](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/addressing-risks-associated-with-an-egregious-leaker-and-disseminator-of-falsehoods/), a former high-ranking [DHS](https://www.dhs.gov/) official.

The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) did this not because there’s evidence of [Krebs](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/addressing-risks-from-chris-krebs-and-government-censorship/) or [Taylor](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/addressing-risks-associated-with-an-egregious-leaker-and-disseminator-of-falsehoods/) having done anything wrong, but [because they defied him](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/authoritarian-fashion-trump-orders-probes-two-ex-officials-defied-rcna200574) several years ago. They went on his enemies list, and now he’s exacting revenge.

Around the same time, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) also directed the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) to [investigate ActBlue](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-signs-order-targeting-democrats-fundraising-platform-sparking-au-rcna202970), the [Democratic Party](https://www.democrats.org/)’s most important fundraising platform.

And did I mention the investigation into former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director James Comey? [Because that's underway, too](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/james-comey-trump-retribution-powerful-rcna207964).

The [Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) also recently [highlighted the broader pattern](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/us/politics/trump-republicans-attack-democrats-actblue.html):

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his allies are aggressively attacking the players and machinery that power the left, taking a series of highly partisan official actions that, if successful, will threaten to hobble [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/)’ ability to compete in elections for years to come.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his team are also going after [law firms](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-houses-latest-law-firm-offensive-different-rcna200610), [universities](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-admin-blocks-harvard-enrolling-international-students-escalating-rcna208587) and [news organizations](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/tensions-trumps-bizarre-lawsuit-cbs-news-chief-steps-rcna207766) they consider political foes of the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).

What’s more, given [Ed Martin’s new responsibilities](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/21/us/politics/trump-justice-department-ed-martin-weaponization.html) at the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/), this overtly and abusive partisan pattern is likely to intensify.

My conservative readers will likely see this and say, “Well, during the [Biden administration](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/), [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was subjected to investigations, so what’s good for the goose is good for the gander.”

But that talking point remains absurd. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) faced federal criminal investigations, not because of a retaliatory agenda, but because of voluminous evidence that he committed a variety of alleged felonies.

[Axios recently noted](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/21/trump-retaliation-revenge-biden-security-clearance), “In the final days of the 2024 campaign, Axios [identified a list of perceived adversaries](https://www.axios.com/2024/11/01/trumps-enemies-within-list) who fit what [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) ominously described as ‘the enemies from within.’ As [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), he has taken steps to retaliate against virtually all of them.”

That was two months ago. The problem is vastly worse now, and there’s no reason to believe conditions will improve anytime soon.
