## [Japan says its $1 trillion in US Treasuries is among tools for trade talks](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/japan-says-its-1-trillion-in-us-treasuries-is-among-tools-for-trade-talks/ar-AA1E0Tfm?ocid=emmx-mmx-feeds&cvid=dc580c044ff242d7a9c03c65832866ca&PC=EMMX01)

Story by Leika Kihara and Makiko Yamazaki. May 2, 2025.

[TOKYO](https://www.japan.travel/jp/destinations/kanto/tokyo/) ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/)) -[Japan](https://www.japan.go.jp/)'s huge $1 trillion-plus in [U.S. Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/TextView) holdings are among the tools available for [Tokyo](https://www.japan.travel/jp/destinations/kanto/tokyo/) to use in trade negotiations with the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/), [Japanese](https://www.japan.go.jp/) [Finance Minister](https://www.mof.go.jp/) [Katsunobu Kato](https://japan.kantei.go.jp/103/meibo/daijin/kato_katsunobu_e.html) said on Friday.

The remark came as [Japan](https://www.japan.go.jp/)'s top trade negotiator [Ryosei Akazawa](https://www.ryosei-akazawa.com/) met with [U.S. Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/) [Secretary Scott Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) in [Washington](https://dc.gov/) for a second round of bilateral tariff talks.

[Kato](https://japan.kantei.go.jp/103/meibo/daijin/kato_katsunobu_e.html) said the primary purpose of [Japan](https://www.japan.go.jp/)'s [U.S. Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/TextView) holdings - the largest in the world - is to ensure it has sufficient liquidity to conduct yen intervention when necessary.

"But we obviously need to put all cards on the table in negotiations. It could be among such cards," [Kato](https://japan.kantei.go.jp/103/meibo/daijin/kato_katsunobu_e.html) said in a television programme when asked whether [Japan](https://www.japan.go.jp/), in trade talks with the [U.S.](https://www.usa.gov/), could reassure [Washington](https://dc.gov/) it will not sell its Treasury holdings in the market.

"Whether we actually use that card, however, is a different question," [Kato](https://japan.kantei.go.jp/103/meibo/daijin/kato_katsunobu_e.html) added.

The comments contrast with those [Kato](https://japan.kantei.go.jp/103/meibo/daijin/kato_katsunobu_e.html) made last month, when he ruled out using [Japan](https://www.japan.go.jp/)'s [U.S. Treasury holdings](https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/TextView) as trade leverage.

[Kato](https://japan.kantei.go.jp/103/meibo/daijin/kato_katsunobu_e.html) did not comment when asked whether [Japan](https://www.japan.go.jp/)'s [U.S. Treasury holdings](https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/TextView) came up in his bilateral meeting with Bessent last week in [Washington](https://dc.gov/).

But he said the huge market sell-off in [Treasuries](https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/TextView) in April likely affected [Washington](https://dc.gov/)'s approach in talks with [Japan](https://www.japan.go.jp/).

"It won't be good for the economy and financial system for markets to be too unstable," he said on how [U.S. Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/TextView) yield moves could affect [Japan](https://www.japan.go.jp/) and its economy.

[Kato](https://japan.kantei.go.jp/103/meibo/daijin/kato_katsunobu_e.html) also said his meeting with Bessent last week did not discuss any desirable level of exchange-rates or a possible framework to control currency moves.

"[Japan](https://www.japan.go.jp/) doesn't manipulate currencies," [Kato](https://japan.kantei.go.jp/103/meibo/daijin/kato_katsunobu_e.html) said. "We'll need to explain this point thoroughly to the U.S.," he said on [U.S. President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s accusations that [Japan](https://www.japan.go.jp/) was intentionally weakening the yen to give exports a trade advantage.

[Tokyo](https://www.japan.travel/jp/destinations/kanto/tokyo/) explains its currency intervention as aimed at arresting excessive volatility in the exchange-rate market that is out of sync with economic fundamentals. Last year, it intervened to boost the yen as the currency's declines raised import costs and hurt consumption.

The 10 trading days since [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) hit automakers with tariffs on April 2 were the most convulsive since the pandemic panic of 2020, as prices of stocks, bonds and the dollar swung wildly.

The [U.S. Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/TextView) sell-off was among the factors that led [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to announce a 90-day pause on his "reciprocal" tariff plan, with [Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) likely playing a key role, according to sources close to the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).

The raging trade war with [China](https://www gov.cn/) and the possibility of a U.S. recession have spurred talks of overseas investors reducing their dollar and U.S. debt positions - considered traditional hedges against market turmoil.

Foreign holdings of [U.S. Treasuries](https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/TextView) rose 3.4% in February, data from the [Treasury Department](https://home.treasury.gov/) showed last month, with the two largest owners, [Japan](https://www.japan.go.jp/) and [China](https://www gov.cn/), building up their U.S. debt holdings.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has hit [Japan](https://www.japan.go.jp/) with 24% tariffs on its exports to the U.S., although, like most of his levies, they have been paused until early July to allow room for negotiations. A 10% universal rate remains in place, as does a 25% duty on cars, a mainstay of [Japan](https://www.japan.go.jp/)'s export-heavy economy.
