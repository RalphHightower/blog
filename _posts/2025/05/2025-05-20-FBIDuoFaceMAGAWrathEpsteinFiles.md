## [Kash Patel and Dan Bongino face MAGA wrath after dismissing Epstein conspiracy theories](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kash-patel-dan-bongino-epstein-death-conspiracy-theories-rcna207785)

*[FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Director Kash Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) and his deputy, [Dan Bongino](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/deputy-director-dan-bongino), enraged MAGA world when they dismissed speculation about Jeffrey Epstein’s death.*

[FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Director Kash Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) and his deputy, [Dan Bongino](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/deputy-director-dan-bongino), are [well-known for being conspiracy theorists](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/s-new-day-fbi-dan-bongino-joins-kash-patel-bureau-rcna196906) in their own right, but they’re feeling the heat from MAGA world after dismissing conspiracy theories about the death of Jeffrey Epstein.

[Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) and [Bongino](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/deputy-director-dan-bongino) faced a wave of anger after proclaiming that the alleged sex trafficker had died by suicide — and wasn’t killed in prison, as some conspiracy theorists believe. The unproven homicide allegations have spurred [wild theories](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jeffrey-epstein-death-fuels-many-conspiracy-theories-rcna92112) that Epstein might have been killed to maintain secrecy about co-conspirators, but [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) and [Bongino](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/deputy-director-dan-bongino) [threw cold water](https://x.com/atrupar/status/1924158226435600691) on the claims during a Fox Business interview on Sunday:

And [Bongino](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/deputy-director-dan-bongino) was hit with a flood of conspiratorial angst by MAGA-aligned social media accounts when he doubled down in a post about the interview on X.

“I was asked about some of the details surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein case. I have reviewed the case. Jeffrey Epstein killed himself,” [he wrote](https://x.com/[FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/)DDBongino](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/deputy-director-dan-bongino)/status/1924115672021241991). “There’s no evidence in the case file indicating otherwise. I’m not asking you to believe me, or not. I’m telling you what exists, and what doesn’t. If new evidence surfaces I’m happy to reevaluate.”

And popular far-right figures, like conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, were none too happy that this tinfoil hat claim had been shot down by two of the most recognizable peddlers of fake news in the conservative movement. In a lengthy post on X, Jones called [Bongino](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/deputy-director-dan-bongino) and [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s remarks “bullshit.”

Both [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) and [Bongino](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/deputy-director-dan-bongino) arguably bear responsibility for the outrage from the MAGA faithful. [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) has previously [promoted the QAnon conspiracy theory](https://www.npr.org/2024/12/09/nx-s1-5213692/kash-patel-conspiracy-theories-fbi), which is centered on the baseless belief that top [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) are involved in child sex trafficking. [Bongino](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/deputy-director-dan-bongino) has said “the left is evil” and infected with “demon energy,” and he also has called for [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) leaders to be imprisoned.

Now, much like [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/), [who also has faced backlash over Epstein](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/jeffrey-epstein-files-pam-bondi-documents-release-rcna195177), [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) and [Bongino](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/deputy-director-dan-bongino) appear to be discovering the pitfalls of dealing with rabid conspiracy theorists. Some conservatives have a seemingly insatiable hunger for more details to drop from the case. But two of the figures who’ve been known to throw them red meat in the past don’t seem to have much more to offer at the moment.
