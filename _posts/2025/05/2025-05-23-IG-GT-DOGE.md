title: "Government Inspectors Do a Better Job Than Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)"

## [A new report shows how the government handles inefficiency better than Elon Musk](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/doge-elon-musk-firings-efficiency-watchdog-report-rcna208241)

*[Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) have released a report showing how [inspectors general](https://www.ignet.gov/) most likely outperform [Elon Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) when it comes to saving money.*

May 21, 2025, 7:28 PM EDT
By Zeeshan Aleem, [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) Opinion Writer/Editor
[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [fired inspectors general across 18 federal agencies](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-fires-multiple-inspectors-general-legally-murky-overnight-move-rcna189261) in his first week in office, and then [another IG in February](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-fires-usaid-inspector-general-report-critical-funding-freeze-rcna191815), in a systematic ousting of the independent watchdogs who monitor the [federal government](https://www.usa.gov/) for waste, fraud and abuse. Now a [new report](https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/REPORT.pdf) released by [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) on the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee](http://www.hsgac.senate.gov/) says the potential savings the [IG](http://www.ignet.gov/)s had identified before being fired exceeds what [Elon Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) claims he has saved with his [so-called Department of Government Efficiency](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/elon-musk-doge-savings-trump-rcna203051).

As [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) [reduces his involvement](https://www.nbcnews.com/now/video/elon-musk-says-he-will-step-back-from-politics-and-government-240003141641) in the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/), the report’s numbers help hammer home just how poorly and foolishly he has pursued “efficiency.” He rode into [Washington](https://dc.gov/) with his [DOGE](https://doge.gov/) cowboys, confident that their rogue outsider status gave them a unique ability to drain “the swamp” of excess spending. But they not only failed to come anywhere close to hitting their goals — they may have underperformed compared with the personnel who were already in the government to help them achieve their purported goal.

> *[Inspectors general](https://www.ignet.gov/) are independent, nonpartisan professional watchdogs.*

[Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)’s promised pot of savings began at [\$2 trillion, before shrinking to \$1 trillion and then to \$150 billion.](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/reality-gets-way-elon-musks-latest-misguided-boast-rcna201113). His estimated savings have ticked up again slightly to an [estimated \$170 billion](https://doge.gov/savings), or 8.5% of his initial promise.

The [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/)' report [crunched the numbers](https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/REPORT.pdf) and found that the 19 fired IGs had identified and recommended \$175 billion in potential savings through audits, investigations and efficiency proposals. That’s \$5 billion more than [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)’s estimate after months of chaotic hacking away at the administrative state. (While the [offices of inspectors general](https://www.ignet.gov/) still exist, the firings of the [IG](http://www.ignet.gov/)s had a demoralizing and chilling effect on the offices, according to the report, and the main duties of rooting out waste, fraud and corruption appear to have been given to [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk).)

Granted, the report’s calculation of the [IG](http://www.ignet.gov/)s’ potential savings wouldn’t necessarily end up hitting its topline number. But the source of its estimates for cost-cutting is far more reliable than [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)’s estimates.

[Inspectors general](http://www.ignet.gov/) are independent, nonpartisan professional watchdogs. They report to respective agency heads, but [those agency heads can’t alter their](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-20-639r.pdf) [reports](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-20-639r.pdf), which must be shared with [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/). They have a track record of rooting out waste — in fiscal year 2024, all [IG](http://www.ignet.gov/)s in the federal government had "over \$71 billion in combined monetary impact" through their efficiency initiatives, audits and investigations, according to the [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/)’ report. These efforts include things like questioning unnecessary spending, finding and cracking down on illegal federal contracts, sniffing out public officials inappropriately using money and tracking down actors trying to defraud the government through illicit procurement schemes.

By contrast, [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)’s savings estimates aren’t trustworthy, given the long record of [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)’s [exaggerating savings using incorrect calculations](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/doge-elon-musk-website-receipts-cuts-savings-rcna194082), such as [double-counting canceled federal contracts](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/us/politics/doge-musk-contracts-trump.html), claiming savings over already canceled contracts and not accounting for the added cost of revived contracts. [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)’s website for tracking [DOGE](https://doge.gov/) savings doesn’t acknowledge or account for errors when they’re identified by the media. Those errors are simply deleted.

> *Many of the savings [DOGE](https://doge.gov/) has under its belt could be ephemeral and overturned by [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) or another [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/).*

Moreover, the durability of [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)’s cuts is also far more questionable, since they’ve often been implemented with such brute force and speed that they’re often overturned. Many have been [reversed by the courts](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/05/18/federal-employees-fired-rehired-await-court-decision/83600693007/). Others, such as Ebola prevention efforts, were reversed after [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) admitted they were dangerous and “accidentally” canceled. (Along the way, a number of federal agencies have simply ignored or [declined to enforce his efforts to cull employees](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/elon-musk-doge-5-things-email-cuts-rcna202368) through efficiency efforts.) [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) also [clashed with many of Trump’s Cabinet secretaries](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/05/elon-musk-doge-opponents-dc/682866/) over cuts that they didn’t want to implement. Some watchdog estimates suggest that [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)’s efforts [might end up costing the federal government more than it saves](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/elon-musk-doge-savings-trump-rcna203051), in part because of lost productivity, the high costs of rehiring and lost revenue collection capacities. "So it’s, like, it’s not easy," [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) [said](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/musk-doge-made-progress-effective-after-100-days/story?id=121347452) when reflecting on his progress after 100 days. 

Many of [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)’s cuts have been so controversial and [politically risky](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/doge-cuts-congress-republicans-trump-administration-musk-rcna204549) — such as his [attacks on Social Security](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/social-security-elon-musk-doge-cuts-issues-rcna198034) and medical research funding — that [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [lawmakers](https://www.congress.gov/) [have objected](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/02/musk-doge-cuts-congress-budget/) to [codifying them into law](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/14/trump-impoundment-doge-cuts-congress-00350322). Which is to say that many of the savings [DOGE](https://doge.gov/) has under its belt could be ephemeral and overturned by [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) or another [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/).

Perhaps more important than comparing the saving numbers is noting how [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) have tried to sideline effective tools for rooting out waste and good government. As [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Gary Peters (D-MI)](https://www.peters.senate.gov/), the ranking member of the [committee](http://www.hsgac.senate.gov/) that produced the report, [said in a statement](https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/media/dems/peters-unveils-new-investigative-report-finding-fired-inspectors-general-identified-more-savings-than-doge/): “If the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [Administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) were serious about eliminating waste, it would rely on the proven track record of independent [Inspectors General](https://www.ignet.gov/). Instead, [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s decision to fire them will not only undermine efforts to reduce waste — it sends a message of intimidation to anyone who wants to hold this [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) accountable.”
