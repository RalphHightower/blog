## [On Russia and Putin, Trump returns to his laughable ‘two weeks’ timetable](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/russia-putin-trump-returns-laughable-two-weeks-timetable-rcna209680)

*Will [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) ever come up with an effective policy on [Russia](http://government.ru/)’s war in [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/)? He’ll apparently let the world know — in “two weeks.”*

May 29, 2025, 9:52 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

When it comes to [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s efforts to end [Russia](http://government.ru/)’s war in [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/), the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has failed — [repeatedly](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/ending-russias-war-ukraine-trump-keeps-finding-new-ways-fail-rcna207892). The [Republican](https://www.gop.com%)
’s Plan A for the war in [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/) was [ending the conflict within 24 hours](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-reportedly-frustrated-inability-make-good-foreign-policy-promise-rcna206295) by way of a secret strategy he assured voters was real. When it became obvious that this strategy didn’t actually exist, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) moved on to Plan B: He told [Russia](http://government.ru/) that if it failed to end the conflict quickly, the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) “[would have no other choice](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/113872782548137314)” but to impose new economic sanctions.

When [Vladimir Putin](http://kremlin.ru/) ignored the threats, and [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [failed to follow through](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/ending-russias-war-ukraine-trump-keeps-finding-new-ways-fail-rcna207892), the American [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) floated Plan C (international economic penalties designed to force a ceasefire), Plan D ([Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-backed bilateral talks between [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/) and [Ukrainian](https://www.gov.ua/) [President Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://www.president.gov.ua/)), Plan E (bilateral talks between [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/)) and Plan F ([White House passivity](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/us/politics/trump-ukraine-russia.html)).

As [the Russian military’s assault intensifies](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/russias-state-run-media-mocks-trump-weakness-putin-rcna209411), is [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) finally prepared to try a more effective approach? He’ll apparently let the world know — in a couple of weeks. [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-administration-putin-immigration-doge-crypto-live-updates-rcna208940/rcrd80329?canonicalCard=true):

> *[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) suggested in comments in the [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [on Wednesday afternoon] that he’ll decide in the next two weeks on how he will deal with [Russia](http://government.ru/)’s handling of peace talks with [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/). Asked whether he believes [Russian](http://government.ru/) [President Vladimir Putin](http://kremlin.ru/) wants to end the war in [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) told reporters: ‘I can’t tell you that, but I’ll let you know in about two weeks. Within two weeks, we’re going to find out very soon.”*

It’s hard not to wonder whether [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) realizes just how frequently he’s relied on the unintentionally amusing “[two weeks](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=288227262386602)” pitch.

By now, most observers are probably familiar with how the game is played: The [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) is asked for his position on an issue; he dodges the question by saying he’ll make an announcement “[in two weeks](https://www.axios.com/2017/12/15/trumps-timeline-always-two-weeks-1513302785)”; and then he waits for everyone to forget about his self-imposed deadline.

Where’s [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s health care plan? It’ll be ready [in “two weeks.”](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/transcript-fox-news-sunday-interview-with-president-trump) What about a possible minimum-wage increase? That, too, will be unveiled [in “two weeks.”](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/right-cue-trump-fails-follow-through-minimum-wage-n1234155) On everything from tax policy to infrastructure, immigration to reproductive health, the president’s detailed solutions are always [just “two weeks” away](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-sees-electoral-turnaround-probably-two-weeks-n1247770).

It’s possible that this time will be different. Perhaps, by the second week in June, the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) will make a dramatic announcement about a bold new U.S. policy toward [Russia](http://government.ru/), which will have a meaningful impact on the devastating war in [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/).

But recent history suggests no one should hold their breath. 

As for developments in [Moscow](http://kremlin.ru/), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/), relying on multiple [Russian](http://government.ru/) sources, [reported](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-ukraine-peace-wants-pledge-halt-nato-enlargement-sources-say-2025-05-28/) that [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/)’s conditions for ending the war in [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/) “include a demand that Western leaders pledge in writing to stop enlarging [NATO](https://www.nato.int/) eastwards.”

Of course, given that [it’s Putin’s fault that NATO has added new members](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61397478) in the first place, his apparent condition appears to be a reminder of his own failed strategy.
