Tonight, [Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band](https://brucespringsteen.net/) opened their [Land of Hope & Dreams Tour](https://brucespringsteen.net/news/2025/land-of-hope-and-dreams/) in [Manchester](https://www.manchester.gov.uk/), [England](https://www.gov.uk/). [Bruce](https://brucespringsteen.net/) launched this run of shows with three statements about the situation in the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/), with comments preceding his songs “Land of Hope and Dreams,” “House of a Thousand Guitars” and “My City of Ruins.” Below are the transcripts of all three spoken segments.

#### Introduction to Land of Hope and Dreams

Good Evening!

It’s great to be in [Manchester](https://www.manchester.gov.uk/) and back in the [U.K.](https://www.gov.uk/) Welcome to the [Land of Hope & Dreams Tour](https://brucespringsteen.net/news/2025/land-of-hope-and-dreams/)! The mighty [E Street Band](https://brucespringsteen.net/) is here tonight to call upon the righteous power of art, of music, of rock ‘n’ roll in dangerous times.

In my home, the [America](https://www.usa.gov/) I love, the [America](https://www.usa.gov/) I’ve written about, that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a [corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/).

Tonight, we ask all who believe in democracy and the best of our [American experiment](https://www.usa.gov/) to rise with us, raise your voices against authoritarianism and let freedom ring!

#### Introduction to House of a Thousand Guitars

The last check, the last check on power after the checks and balances of government have failed are the people, you and me. It’s in the union of people around a common set of values now that’s all that stands between a democracy and authoritarianism. At the end of the day, all we’ve got is each other.

#### Introduction to My City of Ruins

There’s some very weird, strange and dangerous shit going on out there right now. In [America](https://www.usa.gov/), they are persecuting people for using their right to free speech and voicing their dissent. This is happening now.

In [America](https://www.usa.gov/), the richest men are taking satisfaction in abandoning the world’s poorest children to sickness and death. This is happening now.

In my country, they’re taking sadistic pleasure in the pain they inflict on [loyal American workers](https://www.usa.gov/).

They’re rolling back historic civil rights legislation that has led to a more just and plural society.

They are abandoning our great allies and siding with dictators against those struggling for their freedom. They are defunding American universities that won’t bow down to their ideological demands.

They are removing residents off American streets and, without due process of law, are deporting them to foreign detention centers and prisons. This is all happening now.

A majority of our elected representatives have failed to protect the [American people](https://www.usa.gov/) from the abuses of an unfit president and a rogue government. They have no concern or idea for what it means to be [deeply American](https://www.usa.gov/).

The [America](https://www.usa.gov/) l’ve sung to you about for 50 years is real and regardless of its faults is a great country with a great people. So we’ll survive this moment. Now, I have hope, because I believe in the truth of what the great American writer James Baldwin said. He said, “In this world, there isn’t as much humanity as one would like, but there’s enough.” Let’s pray.

## [Trump post about Bruce Springsteen helps one person: The Boss](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-post-bruce-springsteen-taylor-swift-gift-rcna207397)

*This week's mini-feud pits two predictable septuagenarians against each other. And the result is a personal gift to the Boss.*

May 17, 2025, 12:54 PM EDT / Updated May 17, 2025, 12:57 PM EDT
By Jeff Slate
[Bruce Springsteen](https://brucespringsteen.net/)’s European tour is scheduled to wrap in Milan the day before Independence Day. But the rock legend may not be feeling very welcome back home.

[Springsteen has been sparring with President Donald Trump)(https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-bruce-springsteen-taylor-swift-uae-rcna207266) over the past few days, with Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) escalating the war of words Friday morning. Sometimes entertaining and sometimes ominous, the mini-feud pits two septuagenarians against each other in the least surprising way possible. And while unlikely to move the needle in 2028, the fact that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) gave in to his boorish impulses is ultimately mostly just a personal gift to the Boss.

It all started on Wednesday, during the first stop of [Springsteen](https://brucespringsteen.net/)’s “Land of Hope and Dreams” tour in Manchester, England. Fairly predictably, and with video and audio conveniently rolling, the Boss took aim at [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his administration.

“The [mighty E Street Band](https://brucespringsteen.net/) is here tonight to call upon the righteous power of art, of music, of rock ’n’ roll in dangerous times,” he said in the minute-long speech, to raucous cheers.

“In my home, the [America](https://www.usa.gov/) I love, the [America](https://www.usa.gov/) I’ve written about, that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration,” he continued before asking fans to “raise your voices against authoritarianism and let freedom ring!”

Later in the evening, [Springsteen](https://brucespringsteen.net/) offered a withering takedown of what he’s seen happening in the U.S. under [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).

“They are persecuting people for using their right to free speech and voicing their dissent,” [Springsteen](https://brucespringsteen.net/) began, in remarks that were later posted on his [website](https://brucespringsteen.net/news/2025/land-of-hope-and-dreams/) and [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@brucespringsteen/videos). He continued:

> *"They’re rolling back historic Civil Rights legislation that led to a more just and plural society. They’re abandoning our great allies and siding with dictators against those struggling for their freedom. They’re defunding American universities that won’t bow down to their ideological demands. They’re removing residents off American streets and, without due process of law, are deporting them to foreign detention centers and prisons."*

He also took aim at [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [fellow Republicans](https://www.gop.com%), as well as the [Democratic Party](https://www.democrats.org/), arguing that they had all failed to protect [Americans](https://www.usa.gov/) “from the abuses of an unfit president and a rogue government.”

Still, he said, “The [America](https://www.usa.gov/) that I’ve sung to you about for 50 years is real, and regardless of its faults is a great country with a great people. So, we’ll survive this moment.”

The [White House almost immediately responded](https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/bruce-springsteen-opens-uk-tour-calling-trump-unfit-office-rcna207194), dismissing [Springsteen](https://brucespringsteen.net/) as “an elite and out-of-touch” celebrity: “Bruce is welcome to stay overseas while hardworking Americans enjoy a secure border and cooling inflation thanks to President [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).”

Then, Friday morning, apparently from [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/) on the way back from his Middle East trip, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) shot back via [social media](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)/posts/114517896576879203).

“I see that Highly Overrated Bruce [Springsteen](https://brucespringsteen.net/) goes to a Foreign Country to speak badly about the [President of the United States](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/),” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wrote on [Liars Club](https://truthsocial.com/). “Never liked him, never liked his music, or his Radical Left Politics and, importantly, he’s not a talented guy — Just a pushy, obnoxious JERK, who fervently supported Crooked Joe Biden.”

> *Calling [Springsteen](https://brucespringsteen.net/) dumb and perhaps visually impaired, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) ended on a personal note.*

Calling [Springsteen](https://brucespringsteen.net/) dumb and perhaps visually impaired, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) ended on a personal note: “This dried out ‘prune’ of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied!) ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back into the Country, that’s just ‘standard fare.’ Then we’ll all see how it goes for him!”

Given the aggressive approach the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has taken over the past three months, the tone was a bit unsettling. Was it a direct warning or just an attempt to chill artistic speech more generally? Or both? ([The American Federation of Musicians of the United States and Canada](https://www.afm.org/) swiftly condemned [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s remarks, noting, “Musicians have the right to freedom of expression.”)

Of course, this is not the first time [Springsteen](https://brucespringsteen.net/) has publicly criticized [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), [calling him](https://www.nbcnews.com/video/springsteen-on-trump-a-flagrant-toxic-narcissist-789170755918) “a flagrant toxic narcissist” during the [2016 campaign](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf). And he regularly appears — especially during presidential campaigns — at major [Democratic Party](https://www.democrats.org/) events.

The title track of [Springsteen](https://brucespringsteen.net/)’s 1984 album “Born in the U.S.A.,” which criticized the Vietnam War and the subsequent treatment of [American veterans](https://www.va.gov/), was embraced by [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Ronald Reagan](https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/) as a modern American anthem, even though its lyrics paint a far darker picture.

[Springsteen](https://brucespringsteen.net/) is 75 now and not making new music of any real impact. His forthcoming release, “Tracks II: The Lost Albums,” the long-awaited follow-up to his “Tracks” box set of studio outtakes from 1998, includes seven unreleased albums, the bulk of which weren’t recorded in this century.

Certainly he knew there was a good chance [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) would react angrily. The pristine video posted to his website (and the transcript of his polemic) definitely telegraphed that. By taunting [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and getting him to punch down, [Springsteen](https://brucespringsteen.net/) gets to play the hero again to his legions of fans. It also gives him a jolt of cultural relevance — or at least a news cycle or two — at a good time.

I want to believe that [Springsteen](https://brucespringsteen.net/)’s speech — which was cheered as a “must-watch” across my social media feed — was delivered for unselfish reasons. There’s certainly no doubt he meant every word of what he said. But that doesn’t mean it’s going to have much of a discernible impact.

Within minutes of responding to [Springsteen](https://brucespringsteen.net/)’s comments, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) had weirdly, but perhaps not surprisingly, moved on to Taylor Swift.

“Has anyone noticed that, since I said ‘I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,’ she’s no longer ‘HOT?’” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wrote, suggesting that his recent criticism of [Swift](https://www.taylorswift.com/) has made her less of a global phenom in recent months. Of course this is preposterous. [Swift](https://www.taylorswift.com/), [top-selling global artist of 2024](https://www.ifpi.org/taylor-swift-makes-music-history-as-ifpis-biggest-selling-global-recording-artist-of-the-year-for-the-fifth-time), isn’t performing much at the moment because she only just wrapped up her record-breaking “Eras Tour” in December.

Could it be that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was having second thoughts about taking [Springsteen](https://brucespringsteen.net/)’s bait? Maybe. But probably not.

### [Trump takes aim at Bruce Springsteen, Taylor Swift on Truth Social during UAE trip](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-bruce-springsteen-taylor-swift-uae-rcna207266)

*The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) used his social media platform to take aim at both the [New Jersey](https://nj.gov/) [rock icon](https://brucespringsteen.net/) and [Taylor Swift](https://www.taylorswift.com/) on Friday.*

May 16, 2025, 11:25 AM EDT / Updated May 16, 2025, 11:33 AM EDT

By [Hayley Miller](https://www.msnbc.com/author/hayley-miller-ncpn1277202)

[Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) made clear Friday that he is not a fan of [Bruce Springsteen](https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/-trump-is-the-most-dangerous-candidate-for-president-in-my-lifetime-springsteen-endorses-harris-220873285729) after the rock icon condemned the [president’s “corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)” at the opening show of his British tour earlier this week.

In [a Truth Social post](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114517896576879203), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) bashed the [Boss](https://brucespringsteen.net/) — once [dubbed by Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-immortals-bruce-springsteen-246699/) as the “embodiment of rock & roll” — as “Highly Overrated” and “not a talented guy.”

“I see that Highly Overrated Bruce Springsteen goes to a Foreign Country to speak badly about the [President of the United States](https://www.whitehouse.gov/),” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wrote. “Never liked him, never liked his music, or his Radical Left Politics and, importantly, he’s not a talented guy.”

@RalphHightower: [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has an alternate reality view of himself. He is not highly intelligent or stable. 

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) went on to accuse [Springsteen](https://brucespringsteen.net/) of being a “pushy, obnoxious JERK” and “dumb as a rock” for having previously supported [President Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/), before attacking [Springsteen](https://brucespringsteen.net/)’s appearance.

“This dried out ‘prune’ of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied!) ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back into the Country,” the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) wrote, adding, “Then we’ll all see how it goes for him!”

[Springsteen](https://brucespringsteen.net/), 75, [made headlines earlier this week](https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/bruce-springsteen-opens-uk-tour-calling-trump-unfit-office-rcna207194) for his pointed criticism of the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) at his concert in [Manchester](https://www.manchester.gov.uk/), [England](https://www.gov.uk/), kicking off his [“Land of Hope and Dreams” tour](https://brucespringsteen.net/news/2025/land-of-hope-and-dreams/).

“In my home, the [America](https://www.usa.gov/) I love, the [America](https://www.usa.gov/) I’ve written about, that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a [corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/),” he said. He went on to ask his fans to “raise your voices against authoritarianism and let freedom ring!”

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), apparently posting from the [United Arab Emirates](https://u.ae/) as [his Middle East trip](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-administration-live-updates-president-trump-set-end-mideast-trip-rcna206143) wraps up, also took aim at another music superstar Friday: [Taylor Swift](https://www.taylorswift.com/). The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) resurrected his feud with the “Cruel Summer” singer in a [Truth Social](https://truthsocial.com/) missive posted minutes before his [Springsteen](https://brucespringsteen.net/) rant.

“Has anyone noticed that, since I said ‘I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,’ she’s no longer ‘HOT?’” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wrote, suggesting that his recent criticism of [Swift](https://www.taylorswift.com/) has made her less of a global phenom in recent months.

[Swift](https://www.taylorswift.com/), the [top-selling global artist of 2024](https://www.ifpi.org/taylor-swift-confirmed-by-ifpi-as-biggest-selling-global-recording-artist-of-the-year/), has stepped away from the spotlight in recent months after wrapping her record-breaking international [“Eras Tour”](https://tserasarchive.taylorswift.com/selftitled) in December. Trump [lashed out at her during the 2024 election cycle](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/50-days-go-trumps-message-voters-muddled-mess-rcna171271) after she endorsed [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) nominee [Kamala Harris](https://kamalaharris.com/).

By Mithil Aggarwal

[Bruce Springsteen](https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/bruce-springsteen-open-vault-release-7-albums-never-heard-songs-rcna199478) delivered stinging criticism of the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) at the opening show of his British tour, accusing its officials of authoritarianism, rolling back [civil rights](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/dojs-new-take-civil-rights-students-meet-secret-stage-protest-columbia-rcna202734) and [illegal deportations](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/us-deporting-migrants-libya-rcna205383).

[Springsteen](https://brucespringsteen.net/), 75, a prominent liberal who has long [supported Democratic presidential candidates](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/celebrating-america-top-moments-biden-s-presidential-inauguration-special-n1255103) including former Vice President [Kamala Harris](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/kamala-harris/kamala-harris-reemerge-trump-speech-rcna203387), made the remarks at a concert in [Manchester](https://www.manchester.gov.uk/), [England](https://www.gov.uk/), on Wednesday that was the first in his [“Land of Hope and Dreams”](https://brucespringsteen.net/news/2025/land-of-hope-and-dreams/) tour.

“The mighty [E Street Band](https://brucespringsteen.net/) is here tonight to call upon the righteous power of art, of music, of  rock ’n’ roll in dangerous times,” he said to roars from the crowd.

“In my home, the [America](https://www.usa.gov/) I love, the [America](https://www.usa.gov/) I’ve written about, that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration.”

[Springsteen](https://brucespringsteen.net/) then asked supporters of democracy to “raise your voices against authoritarianism and let freedom ring!” before beginning the show.

Later in the performance, he described what he saw happening in the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) under [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2028-election/-eight-year-president-trump-weighs-third-term-speculation-rcna204579).

“They are persecuting people for using their right to free speech and voicing their dissent,” [Springsteen](https://brucespringsteen.net/) said in his remarks, a transcript and video of which were later posted on his [website](https://brucespringsteen.net/news/2025/land-of-hope-and-dreams/) and [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@brucespringsteen/videos).

He also accused the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) of “abandoning the world’s poorest children to sickness and death” and “taking sadistic pleasure in the pain that they inflict on loyal American workers.”

“They’re rolling back historic civil rights legislation that led to a more just and plural society,” [Springsteen]) said. “They’re abandoning our great allies and siding with dictators against those struggling for their freedom.”

“They’re defunding [American](https://www.usa.gov/) universities that won’t bow down to their ideological demands. They’re removing residents off [American](https://www.usa.gov/) streets and, without due process of law, are deporting them to foreign detention centers and prisons.”

[Springsteen](https://brucespringsteen.net/) also said most elected representatives had failed to protect Americans “from the abuses of an unfit president and a rogue government.”

Still, he said, “The [America](https://www.usa.gov/) that I’ve sung to you about for 50 years is real, and regardless of its faults is a great country with a great people.”

“So we’ll survive this moment,” he added.

The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) said in a statement that “the 77 million [Americans](https://www.usa.gov/) that elected [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) disagree with elitist and out-of-touch celebrities like [Bruce Springsteen](https://brucespringsteen.net/). [Bruce](https://brucespringsteen.net/) is welcome to stay overseas while hardworking [Americans](https://www.usa.gov/) enjoy a secure border and cooling inflation thanks to [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).”

This is not the first time [Springsteen](https://brucespringsteen.net/) has publicly criticized [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), calling him “a flagrant toxic narcissist” before his election in 2016.

[Springsteen](https://brucespringsteen.net/) is known for albums that celebrate and critically examine American ideals, most notably his 1984 album “Born in the U.S.A.,” in which he criticized the Vietnam War and the subsequent treatment of American veterans.

He is set to [debut 83 previously unreleased songs](https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/bruce-springsteen-open-vault-release-7-albums-never-heard-songs-rcna199478) in late June, 74 of which have never been heard before by the public.
