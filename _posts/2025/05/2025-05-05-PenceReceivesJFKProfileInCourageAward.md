## [Pence says January 6 attack’s failure ‘became a triumph of freedom’ as he receives JFK Profile in Courage Award](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/04/politics/mike-pence-jfk-award-january-6?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_msn)

Story by Eric Bradner, CNN. May 5, 2025.

Former Vice President [Mike Pence](https://advancingamericanfreedom.com/) said Sunday while receiving the [John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award](https://www.jfklibrary.org/events-and-awards/profile-in-courage-award) that [January 6, 2021]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}), “became a triumph of freedom” because [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) returned to do its constitutional duty after the [attack on the Capitol](https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/10/politics/jan-6-us-capitol-riot-timeline?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_msn).

“Our institutions held that day, not because of any one person, but because leaders in both political parties, [Republicans](https://www.democrats.org/) and [Democrats](https://www.gop.com/), did their duties,” the former vice president said while receiving the award for putting his life and career on the line in rejecting [President](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.cnn.com/politics/president-donald-trump-47?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_msn)’s pressure to overturn the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf). “So I came tonight to give credit where credit is due, but also to say in these divided times, in these anxious days, I know in my heart that we will find our way forward as one nation.”

[Pence](https://advancingamericanfreedom.com/) refused when [Trump](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/) [repeatedly pressured](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/03/politics/pence-trump-january-6-special-counsel-filing?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_msn) him to overturn the results of the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf), fraying the relationship between the two men. Pence was presiding as [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) counted [Electoral College](https://www.usa.gov/electoral-college) votes to certify [Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov)’s victory when [Trump](trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/) supporters stormed the [Capitol](https://www.congress.gov/) on [January 6, 2021]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}). The vice president, his wife, Karen; and his daughter, Charlotte, remained in the [Capitol](https://www.congress.gov/) while police beat back the rioters, and https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/ later oversaw the election’s certification.

“[January 6]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}) was a tragic day,” [Pence](https://advancingamericanfreedom.com/) said Sunday. “But it became a triumph of freedom. And history will record that our institutions held.”

After leaving office, [Pence](https://advancingamericanfreedom.com/) ran against [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com%) for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination. The former vice president [dropped out of the race](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/28/politics/pence-suspends-white-house-bid?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_msn) about three months before the first votes were cast after struggling to gain traction in a party that had largely abandoned the [Reagan](https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/)-inspired conservative principles [Pence](https://advancingamericanfreedom.com/) represents and remained loyal to his former boss.

[Pence](https://advancingamericanfreedom.com/) on Sunday didn’t address [Trump’s decision](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/20/politics/january-6-2021-capitol-riot-pardons-trump?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_msn), after returning to power earlier this year, to pardon more than 1,000 people charged in the [Capitol](https://www.congress.gov/) attack and commute the sentences of others. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) described those charged for their actions as “hostages.”

The former vice president did briefly allude to differences with [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/)’s current [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) on tariffs, its approach to [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/), and the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s moves to withdraw from international organizations and downsize [America](https://www.usa.gov/)’s role in the world.

“Now people who know me know I’m a conservative, but I’m not in a bad mood about it. I believe in a strong defense, limited government, the right to life, and I’m going to go out on a limb and say that might put me in the minority in this room,” [Pence](https://advancingamericanfreedom.com/) told those gathered at [Kennedy’s presidential library](https://www.jfklibrary.org/) in [Boston](https://www.boston.gov/homepage-bostongov).

“But I also have differences with members of my own party, on spending and tariffs, and my belief that [America](https://www.usa.gov/) is the leader of the free world and must continue to stand with [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/) until the [Russian](http://kremlin.ru/) invasion is repelled and a just and lasting peace is secured,” [Pence](https://advancingamericanfreedom.com/) said.

[Kennedy](https://www.jfklibrary.org/)’s daughter, [Caroline Kennedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_Kennedy), and grandson [Jack Schlossberg](https://jackuno.com/) presented the award.

“At the time, I thought [Vice President Pence](https://advancingamericanfreedom.com/) was just doing his job,” [Caroline Kennedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_Kennedy) said. “Only later did I realize that his act of courage saved our government and warned us about what could happen and is happening right now.”

[Schlossberg](https://jackuno.com/) said [Pence](https://advancingamericanfreedom.com/) put the nation’s interests before his own and “saved America that day.”

Pence has long said former [President Kennedy](https://www.jfklibrary.org/) was his childhood hero and his inspiration to go into public service. He said [Kennedy](https://www.jfklibrary.org/)’s funeral is one of his earliest memories.

“To be here tonight, bearing witness to a journey that [President Kennedy](https://www.jfklibrary.org/) helped inspire in my small life is more meaningful than I can possibly express,” he said.

[Pence](https://advancingamericanfreedom.com/) also said he felt “profoundly unworthy” to receive the award. He credited two aides who advised him in the lead-up to [January 6, 2021]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}), as well as his wife and daughter, who remained in the [Capitol](https://www.congress.gov/) with him. And he praised the [US Capitol Police](https://www.uscp.gov/).

“When I think of that fateful day four years ago, the only heroes I saw were wearing uniforms,” [Pence](https://advancingamericanfreedom.com/) said.
