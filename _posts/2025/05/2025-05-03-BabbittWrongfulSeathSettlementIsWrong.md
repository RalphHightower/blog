## [Trump’s DOJ agrees to settlement with family of Ashli Babbitt, rioter killed on Jan. 6](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/ashli-babbitt-settlement-jan-6-trump-doj-rcna204525)

*Following her death, the [Air Force](https://www.af.mil%) veteran and QAnon supporter became a martyr of the MAGA movement.*

By Allison Detzel

The [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) has reached a settlement in principle with the family of Ashli Babbitt, the [Jan. 6](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-justice-department-backs-reimbursements-jan-6-criminals-rcna200590) rioter who was [fatally shot by a police officer](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/ashli-babbitt-shooting-video-sullivan-video-rcna149675) during the [2021 attack]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}) on the [U.S. Capitol](https://www.congress.gov/). [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) lawyers and Babbitt’s estate revealed the agreement [during a court hearing Friday](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.269659/gov.uscourts.dcd.269659.54.0.pdf). The amount of the settlement in the wrongful death lawsuit was not disclosed.

The \$30 million lawsuit, [brought by Babbitt’s family and the conservative group Judicial Watch](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/jan-6-participant-ashli-babbitts-husband-conservative-group-file-wrong-rcna132576), alleges that [U.S. Capitol Police](https://www.uscp.gov/) Lt. Michael Byrd was negligent when he fired his gun as Babbitt and other rioters tried to break through doors leading toward the lobby of the [House](https://www.house.gov/) chamber on [Jan. 6, 2021]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}). [The lawsuit](https://www.judicialwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Estate-of-Ashli-Babbitt-and-Arron-Babbitt-et-al.-v.-U.S.A.pdf) accused Byrd of ambushing Babbitt and claimed he was not in uniform, did not identify himself as an officer, and did not provide “any warnings or commands” before shooting.

> *‘Ashli Babbitt was a really good person who was a big MAGA fan, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) fan, and she was innocently standing there,’ Trump said recently.*

Following an internal investigation, both the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) and the [Capitol Police](https://www.uscp.gov/) [cleared Byrd of any wrongdoing](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/officer-who-shot-ashli-babbitt-during-capitol-riot-breaks-silence-n1277736). The [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) said investigators [had examined](https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/department-justice-closes-investigation-death-ashli-babbitt) video footage, physical evidence from the scene, autopsy results and statements from officers and witnesses.

After her death, Babbitt [became a martyr of the MAGA movement](https://www.msnbc.com/all-in/watch/how-jan-6-rioter-ashli-babbitt-became-a-maga-martyr-167027269719), frequently referenced by [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) lawmakers like [Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene](https://www.rawstory.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-ashli-babbit/) of [Georgia](https://www.georgia.go/), who has called on the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) to consider pressing murder charges against Byrd.

Babbitt, an Air Force veteran and QAnon supporter, was also embraced by [Donald Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/donald-trump), who shortly after taking office in January [issued blanket clemency for roughly 1,500 defendants in the Capitol attack](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/granting-pardons-and-commutation-of-sentences-for-certain-offenses-relating-to-the-events-at-or-near-the-united-states-capitol-on-january-6-2021/). In 2021, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) sent Babbitt’s family [a personalized birthday video message](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/trump-s-ashli-babbitt-birthday-video-shows-how-he-hopes-n1281255). In March, [during an interview with Newsmax](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-ashli-babbitt-january-6-michael-byrd-b2721722.html), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said he was a “big fan of Ashli Babbitt.”

“Ashli Babbitt was a really good person who was a big MAGA fan, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) fan, and she was innocently standing there,” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said.

While the details of the settlement haven’t been disclosed, [U.S. District](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/) [Judge Ana Reyes](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/district-judge-ana-c-reyes) said during Friday’s hearing that the government and the plaintiff had indicated it would be at least 30 days before the lawsuit was officially settled.
