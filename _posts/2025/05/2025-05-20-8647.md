## [Why Trump's investigation into James Comey is so alarming](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-investigation-james-comey-free-speech-rcna207797)

*The current investigation into the former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director is precisely what the [First Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/) was designed to guard against.*

May 19, 2025, 5:21 PM EDT

By Jessica Levinson, MSNBC Columnist

Questions are swirling following the launch of a federal [investigation into former FBI Director James Comey](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/team-trump-finds-excuse-s-long-wanted-investigate-james-comey-rcna207219) over a now-deleted social media post of seashells arranged in the numbers “8647” on the beach. (“Eighty-six” is [commonly understood](https://www.merriam-webster.com/wordplay/eighty-six-meaning-origin) to mean “get rid of.” [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is the [45th](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/) and [47th](https://www.whitehouse.gov/[administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)/donald-j-trump/) [[President of the United States](https://www.whitehouse.gov%).) Was Comey calling for the assassination of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)? Or was he, [as he has since stated](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/james-comey-investigation-instagram-post-threat-trump-8647-rcna207167), expressing a political opinion about [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).

> *The genuine threat is not that a president’s life is in danger, but that the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) is attempting to silence the speech of political adversaries.*

If Comey’s post amounted to a siren song, beseeching others to kill the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), he can be punished for his speech. But should Comey’s post be viewed as political advocacy, which I argue it should, he is entitled to the full protection of the [First Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/). The genuine threat is not that a president’s life is in danger, but that the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) is attempting to silence the speech of political adversaries. Even if it is unlikely that Comey faces anything more than a slap on the wrist for his post, the decision to open an investigation in and of itself should be worrisome. Comey has access to the media and resources to defend himself. Not everyone does. And the prospect of chilling political speech critical of government officials should concern all of us. 

Comey isn’t the first former or current public official to refer to other politicians with the number 86. Last year, former [Congressman](https://www.congress.gov_) [Matt Gaetz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattgaetz/), [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov%)’s short-lived pick for [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/), [posted on social media](https://x.com/mattgaetz/status/1762892328941879457), “We’ve now 86’d: McCarthy, McDaniel, McConnell. Better days are ahead for the [Republican Party](https://www.gop.com/).” Given that [Gaetz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattgaetz/) listed politicians who stepped down from leadership positions, it is clear from the context that [Gaetz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattgaetz/) was referring to a political death, not a literal one. [Gaetz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattgaetz/) was not investigated for threats against those politicians, nor should he have been. 

Comey, famously, is not a [not a fan](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/james-comey-investigation-instagram-post-threat-trump-8647-rcna207167). The [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) opened the investigation into possible collusion between the [2016 Trump campaign](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and the [Russian government](http://government.ru/) and [Russian entities](http://kremlin.ru/) while Comey was head of that agency. When [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) later fired Comey, he [alluded](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-reveals-he-asked-comey-whether-he-was-under-investigation-n757821) to the idea that Comey was axed, in part, because of the decision to open that investigation. Post-firing, Comey has argued that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is “[morally unfit to be president](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/james-comey-investigation-instagram-post-threat-trump-8647-rcna207167).” 

The [First Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/) provides that “[Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech.” But we have never actually read the first portion of the [Bill of Rights](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/bill-of-rights/what-does-it-say) to mean that. We allow plenty of laws that abridge and burden speech rights. [Incitement, true threats, and fighting words](https://www.thefire.org/research-learn/unprotected-speech-synopsis) are all examples of categories of speech that can be punished without violating the [First Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/). 

So, does Comey’s post fall within any of these categories of speech? Probably not. 

[Incitement](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/amendment-1/fighting-words-hostile-audiences-and-true-threats-overview) is defined as speech that is “directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.” Mere abstract advocacy, even advocacy to break the law at some future time, is not enough to fall within this category. Because photos of shells on a beach cannot be seen as inciting immediate action, it will be hard to argue that Comey’s post falls in this unprotected category of speech. 

[Fighting](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/amendment-1/fighting-words-hostile-audiences-and-true-threats-overview) words are face-to-face communications that tend to provoke the listener to respond violently and immediately. Here, Comey posted on social media, he did not yell in [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s face. 

Finally, [true threats](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/amendment-1/fighting-words-hostile-audiences-and-true-threats-overview) are “statements where the speaker means to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals.” This is also a high bar. [In 1969](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/394/705/), the court concluded that when a man drafted to serve in the Vietnam War said, “[i]f they ever make me carry a rifle the first man I want to get in my sights is L.B.J.,” that was not enough to fall within the category of true threats. 

More recently, in 2023, the high court clarified that to be prosecuted for “true threats,” law enforcement must show that the speaker had a subjective understanding that the statements were threatening. This seems to be the only plausible category of protected speech that Comey’s posting could fall within. But here again, Comey’s photo of shells, whose message is open to some interpretation, and who has said he intended no violence, falls short. 

The bona fide threat is the one posed by the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/). The government is using the levers of power to try to go after, silence and scare political opponents. This is what the [First Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/) was designed to guard against. 

If there’s one thing that the government would like to insulate itself from, it’s criticism. That’s exactly why political speech, and speech critical of the government, stands at the [apex of First Amendment protection](https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/political-speech/). We must be free to criticize not just government policies, but also those in charge of those policies. This includes, with perhaps the greatest urgency, the most visible member of our government, the president. Without these freedoms, we can and will [slide into an authoritarian regime](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2022/global-expansion-authoritarian-rule) regime. That is why opening a federal investigation against Comey is particularly pernicious and should make us all concerned.

## [Team Trump finds an excuse to do what it’s long wanted to do: investigate James Comey](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/team-trump-finds-excuse-s-long-wanted-investigate-james-comey-rcna207219)

*It’s possible that Republicans are sincerely outraged by the former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director's seashell code, but recent history suggests some skepticism is in order.*

May 16, 2025, 8:56 AM EDT / Updated May 16, 2025, 9:16 AM EDT

By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

With just a couple of weeks remaining before [Election Day 2020](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf), [Michigan Gov.](https://www.michigan.gov/) [Gretchen Whitmer](https://www.michigan.gov/whitmer) appeared on [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/)’ [“Meet the Press”](https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press-full-episodes) and generated headlines for an unexpected reason. While interviews tend to be notable for what guests say, the [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) governor ended up making news for a subtle message she communicated in her on-screen background.

On a table, just behind [Whitmer](https://www.michigan.gov/whitmer)’s shoulder, [viewers could see a small pin](https://www.michiganpublic.org/politics-government/2020-10-23/republicans-criticized-whitmer-for-use-of-86-what-does-it-actually-mean) with four numbers: “8645.” The first two digits were a shorthand for getting rid of something — “86” is [a shorthand that’s been around years](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/86)
In other words, the [Michigan](https://www.michigan.gov/) [governor](https://www.michigan.gov/whitmer) was sending a subtle signal at the height of the election season: Voters should get rid of the incumbent Republican [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), often used in restaurants to refer to items no longer on menus — while the last two digits referred to [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), who was the [45th president](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/) at the time.

The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) campaign [tried to argue](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-whitmer-assassination-attempt-nbc-meet-the-press-interview.amp) that Whitmer was “encouraging assassination attempts,” but few took the claims seriously. The governor [dismissed the criticisms as absurd](https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2020/10/19/8645-meaning-whitmer-trump/3708927001/) as absurd, and the story quickly faded from view.

Nearly five years later, a similar story has emerged, and as [as NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/james-comey-investigation-instagram-post-threat-trump-8647-rcna207167), it’s generating an even more robust response.

> *The Department of Homeland Security and Secret Service are investigating a social media post by former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) Director James Comey that several U.S. officials interpreted as calling for the assassination of [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)[Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Thursday.*

Evidently, Comey shared a photo on Instagram showing seashells arranged to form the numbers “8647.” Republican officials soon after responded with apoplexy, at which point the former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director — himself a lifelong Republican — deleted the post and said, “I didn’t realize some folks associate it with violence. That didn’t occur to me when I saw it but I am opposed to violence in all circumstances so I took it down.”

Comey added soon after that he simply assumed that the numbers “were a political message.”

And while that was hardly an unreasonable assumption — plenty of political figures, [from both parties](https://x.com/mattgaetz/status/1762892328941879457), have used “86” over the years as a shorthand for rejecting political foes — [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) officials responded to Comey in dramatic fashion.

Noem, for example, issued on online statement that claimed, “Disgraced former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) Director James Comey just called for the assassination” of the president. Taylor Budowich, a White House deputy chief of staff, accused Comey of putting out “what can clearly be interpreted as a hit on the sitting [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)of the United States.”

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard appeared on Fox News [and said](https://bsky.app/profile/acyn.bsky.social/post/3lpassmnalb2o) she wants to see Comey “put behind bars for this.” A variety of GOP lawmakers, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, [scrambled to toe the party line](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/15/james-comey-sparks-republican-outrage-with-trump-social-media-post-00353141) and condemn the former FBI director.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) himself ultimately joined the parade, in predictably Trumpian fashion.

I’m obviously not in a position to read any of these partisans’ minds. It’s possible that their outrage was sincere, and they genuinely believed that Comey used Instagram to call for violence against the incumbent [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)by way of a seashell-related code.

But it’s also possible that this elaborate show of anti-Comey wrath is performative.

The reason the latter seems more plausible isn’t just the dubious nature of [Team Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s over-the-top accusations. There’s also recent history to consider.

When the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)first arrived in the White House eight years ago, he saw Comey as an ally — Trump appeared to [literally blow a kiss](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-thanks-the-fbi-director-accused-helping-his-campaign-msna946586) at the then-[FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director at a White House event in January 2017 — thanks in part to Comey’s role in undermining Hillary Clinton’s 2016 candidacy. In time, however, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) soured on Comey, and [ultimately fired him](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-says-bit-too-much-about-james-comey-s-fbi-n1285383) in the hopes of derailing the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/)’s investigation into the president’s Russia scandal.

In the years that followed, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [continued to target the former FBI director](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/team-trump-use-irs-target-perceived-fbi-foes-rcna37063), accusing Comey of “treason,” and even calling for his prosecution over unidentified crimes.

As recently as a few months ago, just days after [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) loyalist Kash Patel was sworn in as the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/)’s newest director, the conservative [Washington Times reported](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/feb/25/fbi-looking-james-comeys-books-honeypot-operation-targeting-2016/) that the bureau had opened an investigation into Comey’s role in the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/)’s investigation into [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s 2016 campaign.

In other words, [Team Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has long seen Comey as a villain who should be targeted and investigated. His since-deleted Instagram post appears to have given the president’s operation an excuse to do what it wanted to do anyway.

WASHINGTON — The Department of Homeland Security and Secret Service are investigating a social media post by former FBI Director [James Comey](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/department-justice-declines-prosecute-comey-over-leaked-memos-n1047706) that several U.S. officials interpreted as calling for the assassination of [[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)Donald Trump](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump), Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Thursday.

In a now-deleted post on Instagram, Comey shared a photo of what he described as a "shell formation" on a beach that formed the numbers "8647." The post was swiftly condemned by [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) officials, Republican lawmakers and [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) allies who said it blatantly targeted [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), the 47th [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)of the United States.

According to the [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/wordplay/eighty-six-meaning-origin) dictionary, "eighty-six" can informally mean "to get rid of."

"Disgraced former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) Director James Comey just called for the assassination of @POTUS [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)," Noem [wrote on X](https://x.com/Sec_Noem/status/1923141313005785365). "DHS and Secret Service is investigating this threat and will respond appropriately."

A spokesperson for the Secret Service, which is part of DHS, said the agency "vigorously investigates anything that can be taken as a potential threat against our protectees."

“We are aware of the social media posts by the former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director and we take rhetoric like this very seriously. Beyond that, we do not comment on protective intelligence matters," Anthony Guglielmi, the agency's chief of communications said in a statement.

Taylor Budowich, a White House deputy chief of staff, accused Comey of putting out “what can clearly be interpreted as a hit on the sitting [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)of the United States.”

“This is deeply concerning to all of us and is being taken seriously,” Budowich wrote on X.

The president's eldest son Donald Trump Jr. accused Comey of "causally calling for my dad to be murdered."

Comey denied that his post was meant as a threat, saying in a statement that he was unaware people linked the specific numeric arrangement with violence.

“I didn’t realize some folks associate it with violence. That didn’t occur to me when I saw it but I am opposed to violence in all circumstances so I took it down,” he said.

Comey later said in [a post](https://www.instagram.com/comey/p/DJsN4GAPoxY/?hl=en) on Instagram that he assumed the numbers "were a political message."

The "eighty-six" wording has been used in a political context before, including by [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s [one-time attorney general pick Matt Gaetz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattgaetz/)](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/matt-gaetz-withdraws-bid-attorney-general-sexual-misconduct-allegation-rcna181206), who used the expression last year [in a post](https://x.com/mattgaetz/status/1762892328941879457) naming [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) he's sparred with in the past.

[Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., called for Comey to be [arrested](https://x.com/timburchett/status/1923134955212677474), while Chris LaCivita, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s former campaign manager, said he would have had Comey’s home raided over the post.

[FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Director Kash Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) [said the](https://x.com/FBIDirectorKash/status/1923151715777356062) bureau is prepared to “provide all necessary support” to the [Secret Service](https://www.secretservice.gov/), which holds primary jurisdiction over the investigation.

Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., called for an "immediate" joint investigation into Comey's post in a letter Thursday night to Patel and Secret Service Director Sean Curran.

Comey was only four years into a 10-year term when [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) fired him in May 2017.

Under Comey, the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) opened an investigation into allegations that members of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s 2016 campaign had contact with Russian entities. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) fired Comey months after that investigation was made public and [hinted that the probe](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-reveals-he-asked-comey-whether-he-was-under-investigation-n757821) was among the factors that led to Comey's termination.

The primary motive for his dismissal, [the White House](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-fires-fbi-director-james-comey-n757101) said at the time, was a conclusion by senior Justice Department officials that Comey bungled an investigation into 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server when she was secretary of state.

The 2024 presidential campaign saw two assassination attempts against [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). The first was at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where a gunman's bullet grazed [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s ear. Secret Service fatally shot the gunman, who killed Corey Comperatore, a former fire chief, and injured two others at the July rally.

Months later, the Secret Service foiled a second assassination attempt on [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) at a golf course near his Mar-a-Lago residence after an agent spotted a man with a rifle outside of the property.The alleged perpetrator faces several [federal](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/ryan-wesley-routh-indicted-attempted-assassination-former-president-trump) and [state](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/florida-charges-ryan-routh-allegedly-tried-assassinate-trump-rcna200708) charges, including the attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate, possessing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence and assaulting a federal officer. He has [pleaded not guilty](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ryan-routh-pleads-not-guilty-charges-sought-assassinate-trump-golf-cou-rcna173254) to all charges.

The former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director is now a fiction writer. He's promoting the release of a new novel, with numerous posts about the book on his Instagram account, including one of him reading on a beach.

Comey has drawn the ire of both political parties in recent years. Democrats derided his decision to publicly announce days before the 2016 election that an investigation into Clinton’s use of emails had been reopened, with the former secretary of state herself asserting in 2017 that the announcement aided [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s victory.

After his termination, Comey became a frequent critic of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), calling him in a [television interview](https://abcnews.go.com/Site/transcript-james-comeys-interview-abc-news-chief-anchor/story?id=54488723) “morally unfit to be [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov)” and later characterizing him as a “unethical” man “untethered to truth” [in a book](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/comey-new-book-paints-trump-liar-divorced-reality-n865651) he released in 2018 that also likened his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) to a mafia organization.

Comey’s criticism of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), and his decision to release a book as investigations he [opened remained ongoing](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/gop-sen-collins-slams-comey-releasing-memoir-during-russia-probe-n868166), has made him a frequent target of Republicans.
