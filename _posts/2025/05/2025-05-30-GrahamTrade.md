Dear Mr. Hightower: 

Thank you for contacting me regarding tariffs.

I believe trade policy should advance American interests and hold bad actors accountable.  I will continue working with my Senate colleagues and President Trump to support policies that level the playing field.  As the Senate reviews trade issues, I will keep your concerns in mind.

As your United States Senator, my primary job is to understand and represent the interests of all South Carolinians.  The opportunity to hear from you about the issues confronting our nation is not only essential to representative democracy, but allows me to better serve the people of South Carolina.  We will not see eye-to-eye on every issue; however, I promise to always give your concerns the consideration they deserve. 

I encourage you to visit my website — http://lgraham.senate.gov — as it will have information on the most recent activities before the U.S. Senate.  You can also sign up for our e-mail newsletter, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube pages which will provide the latest information and updates on the major issues facing our state and our nation.

Thank you again for contacting me. I truly appreciate the opportunity to hear from you and am honored to have the opportunity to represent your interests in the U.S. Senate.

Sincerely,

Lindsey O. Graham
United States Senator

Dear Senator Graham,

Thank you for your reply. However, I need clear answers on the direction America is taking—because the stakes have never been higher.

Are our closest allies—Canada, NATO nations—truly 'bad actors'? If so, by what definition? What does it say about American leadership when our friends are treated as enemies?

If a Democratic president issued executive orders bypassing Congress, attacked the courts, targeted perceived enemies (law firms and former federal employees), undermined independent universities, and encouraged censorship—the outrage from Trump’s allies in Congress would be deafening. Yet today, silence reigns.

February 20, 2025, New York Governor Hochul recently reminded us that America once fought a war to remove a king. Today, we face the same danger—not from monarchy, but from a leader who acts as though he is above the rule of law.

Senator Graham, history is watching. You can choose silence, or you can defend the foundations of democracy while there's still time.
