title: "Trump Wants An Orwellian Database To Track Americans"

This consolidation of citizens' data is a fucking stupid idea. Currently, if a criminal wanted to steal data, they would have to break into the computer systems of multiple agencies. If the data was consolidated into one system, that would be one-stop shopping for criminals.

During Superbowl XVIII Apple ran their "1984" Super Bowl Commercial directed by Ridley Scott, starring Anya Major & David Graham, & conceived by Steve Hayden, Brent Thomas & Lee Clow. It's a classic ad that some might say is more relevant in 2023 than ever. Here I have upscaled it using https://www.topazlabs.com/topaz-video... from various sources including ‪@JasonFoxLCB‬'s excellent recreation, Ridley Scott's archives, & other versions on something called YouTube. 

## [Trump appears to be building an unprecedented spy machine that could track Americans](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-palantir-surveillance-americans-rcna210017)

*A new report shines light on contracts with tech company [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/), which could create data profiles of [Americans](https://www.usa.gov/) to surveil and harass them.*

By [Ja'han Jones](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jahan-jones-ncpn371241)

As [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his administration pursue [crippling austerity measures](https://www.today.com/food/news/usda-food-bank-cuts-rcna200070) across the country, they’re plunging millions of dollars into the [president’s pet projects](https://theintercept.com/2025/05/29/trump-birthday-army-military-dc-parade-cost/). And that includes reportedly giving hundreds of millions of dollars to a company that’s expanding the government’s ability to spy on its own citizens.

The [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) has a new report on the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) awarding contracts to the [controversial](https://www.thenation.com/article/world/nsa-palantir-israel-gaza-ai/) tech [company](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/04/palantir-ipo-ice-immigration-trump-administration) [Palantir](https://www.404media.co/ice-just-paid-palantir-tens-of-millions-for-complete-target-analysis-of-known-populations/?), which is apparently helping [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) develop a database of [Americans](https://www.usa.gov/)’ [private information](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2018-palantir-peter-thiel/?embedded-checkout=true), scraped from various government agencies, that could theoretically be used to track or persecute them.

[According to the Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/technology/trump-palantir-data-americans.html):

> *The push has put a key [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/) product called [Foundry](https://www.palantir.com/platforms/foundry/) into at least four federal agencies, including [D.H.S.](https://www.dhs.gov/) and the [Health and Human Services Department](https://www.hhs.gov/). Widely adopting [Foundry](https://www.palantir.com/platforms/foundry/), which organizes and analyzes data, paves the way for [Mr. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to easily merge information from different agencies, the government officials said. Creating detailed portraits of [Americans](https://www.usa.gov/) based on government data is not just a pipe dream. The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has already sought access to hundreds of data points on citizens and others through government databases, including their bank account numbers, the amount of their student debt, their medical claims and any disability status. [Mr. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) could potentially use such information to advance his political agenda by policing immigrants and punishing critics, [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [lawmakers](https://www.congress.gov/) and critics have said.*

The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) did not respond to the [Times](https://www.nytimes.com/)’ request for comment, and [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/) declined to comment on its work with the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/). It pointed to a company [blog post](https://blog.palantir.com/palantir-is-not-a-data-company-palantir-explained-1-a6fcf8b3e4cb) that said organizations that license its products “define what can and cannot be done with their data; they control the Palantir accounts.”

The [Times](https://www.nytimes.com/)’ report aligns with concerns about surveillance and the weaponization of federal data highlighted by [Rachel Maddow](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/rachel-maddow-biography-n1157621) [during a recent episode featuring Times reporter Julia Angwin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtJRpu4XUw).

[Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/) is one of several private companies that have capitalized on [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s authoritarian ambitions. The company has been [tapped as a key player in Trump’s mass deportation plans](https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-mass-deportations-private-companies-rcna194949) in [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s mass deportation plans, and earlier this year, [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/) CEO Alex Karp gave investors a pretty grim summary of what the company’s full slate of work for the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) could entail.

[As the outlet Mother Jones reported](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/02/palantir-alex-karp-trump-private-prisons-profiteers/):

> *‘I’m very happy to have you along for the journey,’ the CEO said. ‘We are crushing it. We are dedicating our company to the service of the West and the [United States of America](https://www.usa.gov=), and we’re super-proud of the role we play, especially in places we can’t talk about.’ ‘[Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/) is here to disrupt,’ he continued. ‘And, when it’s necessary, to scare our enemies and, on occasion, kill them.’ ([Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/) did not respond to a request for comment.)*

Needless to say, putting [American](https://www.usa.gov/) data in the hands of a company whose CEO boasts about his company’s capacity to kill and intimidate doesn’t inspire confidence that the data will be handled responsibly.

On that note, I’ve been laser-focused on the government’s surveillance capabilities in the age of artificial intelligence, [particularly under the Trump administration](https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-government-surveillance-powers-rcna184941). To learn more about the technologies that enable the sort of surveillance [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/) could soon unleash on [Americans](https://www.usa.gov/), check out my [interview with surveillance and privacy expert Albert Fox Cahn](https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/ai-expert-concerns-robot-revolution-rcna123908).
