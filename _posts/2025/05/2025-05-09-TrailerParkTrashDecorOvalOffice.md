## [Trump reportedly takes over some first lady duties, including White House decor choices](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-white-house-makeover-decor-gold-melania-first-lady-rcna205554)

*First lady [Melania Trump]({% link _posts/2025/03/2025-03-04-StevenColbertInterviewsMelania2.0.md %})’s attention has reportedly been elsewhere in her [husband’s second term](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) to date, as many had expected.*

Since his return to the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) in January, [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has made [glaring changes to the decor](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/controversies-consternation-team-trump-prioritizes-wall-art-rcna194755) around [1600 Pennsylvania Ave.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), including several additions that reflect his long-standing [love for gold](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/18/nx-s1-5366630/trump-oval-office-golden-decor-critique).

In the [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), he has installed [more flags](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-white-house-decor-oval-office-photos-2025-4) and many more portraits of past American leaders, including [several](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/11/white-house-art-trump-assassination-attempt/83048011007/) of [himself](https://x.com/JimmyPatronis/status/1914496818102088047). He has brought back his [Diet Coke](https://www.coca-cola.com/us/en/brands/diet-coke/products) button, according to [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/inside-trumps-oval-officeversion-2-0-9b1da2c8?st=7FYM15&). He has sought to [remake the White House in Mar-a-Lago’s image](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-white-house-oval-office-gold-touches-6018016d), with [gold finishings](https://www.newsweek.com/what-are-those-gold-medallions-trump-keeps-adding-oval-office-2069262), gold decor, [gold trinkets](https://www.fastcompany.com/91329575/none-of-the-objects-on-the-oval-office-mantle-were-made-in-the-u-s)and, down the line, potentially [a ballroom](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-defends-high-cost-military-parade-peanuts-rcna204581). He has suggested [paving over the Rose Garden](https://x.com/Acyn/status/1902507263237222892?) — which his wife infamously [renovated in 2020](https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/14/politics/melania-trump-rose-garden) — to resemble the [patio at his Palm Beach golf club](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/us/politics/mar-a-lago-trump-grass-rose-garden.html).

The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s makeover appears to be getting [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s personal touch. [First lady Melania Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/melania-trump-official-portrait-white-house-rcna189625), who has proven to be [as elusive a figure in her husband’s second term](https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/power/2025/04/21/white-house-easter-egg-roll-2025/) as many had expected, has been conspicuously absent from public discussions about the decor changes.

In fact, according to [The New York Times’ recent reporting](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/us/politics/white-house-melania-absence.html) (which has not been verified by [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) or [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/), [Melania Trump]({% link _posts/2025/03/2025-03-04-StevenColbertInterviewsMelania2.0.md %}) is so rarely at the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) himself has taken over some of the duties that typically fall to the first lady, including decor choices for the residence:

At the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) this time around, [Mr. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has taken to performing some duties that typically would fall to a first lady. She’s not the one carefully selecting light fixtures for the [White House residence](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), redesigning the [Rose Garden](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), greeting tour groups in the [East Wing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) or hosting receptions for [Women’s History Month](https://www.womenshistory.org/womens-history/womens-history-month). He is.

Beyond a handful of public appearances, the [first lady]({% link _posts/2025/03/2025-03-04-StevenColbertInterviewsMelania2.0.md %}) has hardly been spotted in [Washington, D.C.](https://dcgov/), in her [husband’s second term](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) so far. Last month, she participated in the [White House Easter Egg Roll](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-white-house-easter-egg-roll-meta-amazon-youtube-sponsors-rcna201987) and [spoke at](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/melania-trump-honors-women-bring-progress-humanity/story?id=120378743) the [International Women of Courage Awards](https://www.state.gov/secretary-of-states-2025-international-women-of-courage-award-recipients-announced/) at the [State Department](https://www.state.gov/). But she has spent fewer than 14 days altogether at the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) since her husband’s inauguration, the [Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) reported, citing two people with knowledge of her schedule.

The prominence of the first lady role has nevertheless afforded her some promotional opportunities: [Melania Trump]({% link _posts/2025/03/2025-03-04-StevenColbertInterviewsMelania2.0.md %}) launched [her own cryptocurrency](https://fortune.com/2025/05/07/melania-trump-memecoin-anonymous-traders-100-million-payday/) in January, and an [Amazon documentary about her life](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/amazon-melania-trump-documentary-jeff-bezos-rcna186548) is in the works.
