title: "Trump Crime Family: Trump Will Accept Qatari Bribe of Luxury Boeing 747-8 Jumbo Jet to Use as Air Force One"

## [Trump administration will accept a luxury jet from Qatar to use as Air Force One](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-administration-will-accept-luxury-jet-qatar-use-air-force-one-rcna206111)

*[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is expected to discuss arrangements for the plane ppduring his visit to [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) this week, one source said.*

May 11, 2025, 12:59 PM EDT / Updated May 11, 2025, 6:16 PM EDT

The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) is preparing to accept a superluxury [Boeing](https://www.boeing.com/) [747-8 jumbo jet](https://www.boeing.com/commercial/747-8) from the royal family of [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) as a gift to be used by [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) as the new [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/) for [presidential travel](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) until shortly before [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) leaves office, according to four sources familiar with the planning.

Two of the sources also confirm that ownership of the plane will be transferred to the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) presidential library foundation once the president ends his second term.

According to one of the sources, the arrangement will be done according to U.S. and international laws, in observance of ethics rules. That official said it will take some time for the plane to be delivered but that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) will discuss the arrangement during his visit to [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) this week.

Another one of the sources said the idea of gifting [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) this specific plane has been under discussion for “quite some time” and that when the formal offer was made more recently, the president “happily accepted.”

[ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/) [first reported](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-administration-poised-accept-palace-sky-gift-trump/story?id=121680511__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!reDY8glbGcK94QLfFM5eHCtiA0WWkEfU23uSU2-SxKcWLkaI7DBCr-e71bIIRxPXscdUYPyB7qfKAJ3NSIo6e4WHnmzWQOGlZDMEDfHGfMWZN4hMOfDhOZ2r$) the gift.

In response to questions about [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) giving the plane to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) press secretary Karoline Leavitt said gifts from foreign governments are accepted following the law.

“Any gift given by a foreign government is always accepted in full compliance with all applicable laws,” Leavitt said. “[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) is committed to full transparency.”

A [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) official tells [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/) that it is true [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) has offered to donate a plane to the [Department of Defense](https://www.defense.gov/), but the gift will not be presented nor accepted this week while [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is in [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/).

Ali Al-Ansari, [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/)’s media attaché to the U.S., added in a statement, "The possible transfer of an aircraft for temporary use as [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/) is currently under consideration between [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/)’s [Ministry of Defense](https://www.doha.directory/ministry-of-defense/i/694) and the [US Department of Defense](https://www.defense.gov/), but the matter remains under review by the respective legal departments, and no decision has been made."

[Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) have criticized the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) amid reports about their plans to accept a plane, saying that a gift of this magnitude would need congressional approval.

"[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) must seek [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/)’ consent to take this \$300 million gift from [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/). The [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/) is perfectly clear: no present “of any kind whatever” from a foreign state without [Congressional](https://www.congress.gov/) permission. A gift you use for four years and then deposit in your library is still a gift (and a grift)," [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Jamie Raskin (D-MD)](https://raskin.house.gov/), the top [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) on the [House Judiciary Committee](http://judiciary.house.gov/), [wrote in a post](https://x.com/RepRaskin/status/1921553946574782586) on [X](https://x.com/).

[Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Ritchie Torres (D-NY)](https://ritchietorres.house.gov/), called for an investigation into the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)'s plans to accept the plane, characterizing it as a "flying grift" that is "the most valuable gift ever conferred on a [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) by a foreign government."

"Rather than enforcing ethics, the [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) has affixed the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/)’s seal of approval to a transaction that flagrantly violates both the letter and the spirit of the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/)’s [Emoluments Clause](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S1-C7-1/ALDE_00000233/)," [Torres](https://ritchietorres.house.gov/) wrote in a letter to the head of the [Government Accountability Office](https://www.gao.gov/), the acting [Inspector General](https://www.dodig.mil/) of the [Defense Department](https://www.defense.gov/) and the acting director of the [Office of Government Ethics](https://www.oge.gov/).

[Axios](https://www.axios.com/) was the [first to report on Torres' letter](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/11/trump-qatar-plane-democrat-torres-investigation).

[Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Minority Leader](https://bioguide.congress.gov/search/bio/S000148) [Chuck Schumer](https://www.schumer.senate.gov/) similarly blasted [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), calling the plane an example of "foreign influence."

"Nothing says 'America First' like [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/), brought to you by [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/). It’s not just bribery, it’s premium foreign influence with extra legroom," [Schumer (D-NY)](https://www.schumer.senate.gov/). wrote in a post on [X](https://x.com/).

[Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Bernie Sanders I-VT)](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/), went even further, calling the move "corrupt" and "unconstitutional."

"I don’t know who needs to hear this, but NO, [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) cannot accept a \$400 million flying palace from the royal family of [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/). Not only is this farcically corrupt, it is blatantly unconstitutional," [Sanders](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/) wrote.

[Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) officials did not respond to a question from [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/) whether [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s acceptance of the plane could violate federal anti-bribery laws or the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/)’s [emoluments clause](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S9-C8-3/ALDE_00013206/) which bars the president and other federal officials from accepting gifts from foreign powers without the approval of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/).

[ABC News](abcnews.go.com/) reported that [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) and other [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) lawyers had determined that the acceptance of the plane was legally permissible if the [Qatari government](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) gifts it to the [Defense Department](https://www.defense.gov/) and it is later turned over to the [Trump Library Foundation](http://www.trumplibrary.gov/).

A former senior [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) official who spoke on condition of anonymity said that for the jet gift to violate federal laws barring the payment of bribes or gratuities to officials, the gift would have to be motivated by corrupt intent.

“Bribery requires a corrupt intent to influence an official act, i.e., a quid pro quo,” said the former official.
[Norm Eisen](https://www.brookings.edu/people/norman-eisen/), who served as special assistant to the president for ethics in the [Obama administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/), said that the gift violated the [emoluments clause](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S9-C8-3/ALDE_00013206/). [Eisen](https://www.brookings.edu/people/norman-eisen/), a longtime critic of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s ethics in office, and now a senior fellow at the [Brookings Institution](https://www.brookings.edu/), said that he is considering whether to challenge the transfer of the 747 in court.


“Suffice it to say that I and many others are looking,” said [Eisen](https://www.brookings.edu/people/norman-eisen/), who referred to the plane as “emoluments force one.”

[Eisen](https://www.brookings.edu/people/norman-eisen/) said that he believed the plane could not be accepted without the approval of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/).

“I do think there is a violation here. The problem is that you have what is functionally a direct gift to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/),” [Eisen](https://www.brookings.edu/people/norman-eisen/) added.

News of the plane comes ahead of the president’s [first foreign trip](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-snubs-traditional-allies-marks-gulf-power-first-foreign-trip-rcna204808) of his second term, in which he will travel to [Saudi Arabi](https://my.gov.sa/) this week and also make stops in the [United Arab Emirates](https://u.ae/) and [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/).

While in [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is expected to deliver a speech and then talk with [American troops](https://www.defense.gov/) at the [Al Udeid Air Base](https://www.afcent.af.mil/Units/379th-Air-Expeditionary-Wing/), according to two U.S. officials.

[Defense](https://www.defense.gov/) [Secretary Pete Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) is expected to accompany Trump during his stop at the base.

This is the second time [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has decided to visit [Saudi Arabia](https://my.gov.sa/) for his first foreign trip. He chose the same nation as his first stop in 2017, during his [first term](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/).
