As the fight over the [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/)’ so-called [One Bigly Beautiful Bill Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text) unfolded, much of the focus turned to [Medicaif](https://www.medicaid.gov/), and for good reason. Despite [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [promise not to cut the health care program](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/promising-not-cut-medicaid-trump-starts-pointing-fine-print-rcna207937), the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) legislation would [cut roughly \$700 billion](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/budget-office-republicans-megabill-give-rich-richer-take-poor-rcna208175) from [Medicaif](https://www.medicaid.gov/) in the coming years, and with just hours remaining before the bill reached the floor, party leaders added [new and punitive Medicaid provisions](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/21/house-republicans-propose-disincentives-for-states-to-expand-medicaid-00364471) to shore up support from far-right members.

But as important as the future of [Medicaif](https://www.medicaid.gov/) is, the legislation’s impact on [Medicare](https://www.medicare.gov/) matters, too.

If people were to dig into the [1,000-page bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text) to look for the provisions related to [Medicare](https://www.medicare.gov/) cuts, they won’t find them. But there’s a difference between the literal text of the legislation and the practical effects of the legislation.

In fact, as [The Washington Post reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/05/21/medicare-cuts-big-beautiful-bill-republicans-house/), the [Congressional Budget Office](https://www.cbo.gov/) found that the [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/)’ megabill would add so many trillions of dollars to the national debt, “it could force nearly \$500 billion in cuts to [Medicare](https://www.medicare.gov/)” — with some cuts taking effect as early as next year. As the [Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) noted, the higher deficits would force budget officials “to mandate across-the-board spending cuts over that window that would hit the federal health insurance program for seniors and people with disabilities.”

> *When legislation significantly adds to the national debt, which already exceeds \$36.2 trillion, it triggers ‘sequestration,’ or compulsory budgetary reductions. In that scenario, [Medicare](https://www.medicare.gov/) cuts would be capped at 4 percent annually, or \$490 billion over 10 years, the CBO reported in response to a request from [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Brendan Boyle (D-PA)](https://boyle.house.gov/), the top [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) on the [Budget Committee](https://budget.house.gov/).*

Referencing [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/)’ [Pay-As-You-Go (“PAYGO”) Act](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title2/chapter20A&edition=prelim), [Boyle](https://boyle.house.gov/) said in a written statement, “This [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) budget bill is one of the most expensive — and dangerous — bills [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) has seen in decades. The nonpartisan [CBO](https://www.cbo.gov/) makes it clear: The deficit will explode so badly it will trigger automatic cuts, including over half a trillion dollars from [Medicare](https://www.medicare.gov/).”

The [Pennsylvania Democrat](https://boyle.house.gov/) added, “This is what [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) do — pay for massive tax breaks for billionaires by going after programs families rely on the most: Medicaid, food assistance, and now [Medicare](https://www.medicare.gov/). It’s reckless, dishonest, and deeply harmful to the middle class.”

Though it’s unlikely that [congressional](https://www.congress.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) read it, the [CBO](https://www.cbo.gov/) published [a relatively brief three-page summary](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61423) of its [Medicare](https://www.medicare.gov/) findings on Tuesday night, ahead of Thursday morning’s vote.

In fairness, [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) would have opportunities to pass separate legislation to mitigate the damage created by the [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/)’ agenda. Given that [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) members wouldn’t want to be responsible for massive [Medicare](https://www.medicare.gov/) cuts, such action would be likely.

But that doesn’t change the bottom line: The [CBO](https://www.cbo.gov/) told the [House](https://www.house.gov/) that the [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/)’ reconciliation package would lead to \$500 billion in cuts to [Medicare](https://www.medicare.gov/), and two days later, [215 House Republicans](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/whats-next-house-gop-megabill-trump-passes-rcna208461) voted for it anyway.
