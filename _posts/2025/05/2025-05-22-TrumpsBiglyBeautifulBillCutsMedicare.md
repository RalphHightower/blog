## [Trump made a promise not to touch Medicare. His megabill just broke it.](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-made-promise-not-touch-medicare-megabill-just-broke-rcna208518)

*The [House](https://www.house.gov/) bill, as of now, would trigger massive cuts to the program.*

May 23, 2025, 2:40 PM EDT

By Alan L. Cohen], senior fellow at the [Center for American Progress](https://www.americanprogress.org/)

As many [Americans](https://www.usa.gov/) were still sleeping Thursday morning, the [House of Representatives](https://www.house.gov/) passed a bill whose text they hadn’t read, [Donald Trump’s so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-senate-big-beautiful-bill-rcna208520). The bill’s [sweeping cuts to Medicaid](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-medicaid-social-security-red-tape-rcna207999), contributing to 14 million fewer people having health coverage by 2034, have received wide coverage. Less well known, however, is the bill’s [dire implications for Medicare recipients](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/medicare-cuts-medicaid-republicans-reconciliation-bill-rcna208484). If the [House](https://www.house.gov/) version of the bill becomes law, [Medicare](https://www.medicare.gov/) payments to medical providers would be slashed by more than \$500 billion over the next 10 years. This would have serious implications for tens of millions of older adults and providers and may even cause hospitals to close.

Though the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) bill doesn’t explicitly call for [Medicare](https://www.medicare.gov/) cuts, it would trigger them under the [Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title2/chapter20A&edition=prelim). [Congress](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title2/chapter20A&edition=prelim) passed [Stat PAYGO](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title2/chapter20A&edition=prelim) in 2010 to discourage policymakers from enacting tax cuts and spending that would increase federal deficits.

> *Shuttered facilities would threaten health care access for older adults and all community members alike.*

Under [Stat PAYGO](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title2/chapter20A&edition=prelim), the [Office of Management and Budget](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/) must keep [“PAYGO scorecards”](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title2/chapter20A&edition=prelim) for five-year deficit impacts and 10-year deficit impacts. [PAYGO](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title2/chapter20A&edition=prelim) stipulates that when any legislation is enacted, the average cost of the legislation for the next five years is entered into each year of the five-year scorecard and the average cost for the next 10 years is entered into each year of the 10-year scorecard. At the end of each session of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/), if there is a cumulative deficit in that fiscal year on either scorecard, there is an automatic spending reduction (sequestration) to offset the larger of the two deficits. The [Congressional Budget Office estimates](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61420) that the [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text), if enacted, would increase the deficit by \$2.3 trillion over 10 years, and trigger sequestration.

Some types of funding, including many mandatory spending accounts like [Social Security](https://www.ssa.gov/), are exempt from the automatic cuts, but [Medicare](https://www.medicare.gov/) provider payments are not. Though there is a 4% limit on [Medicare](https://www.medicare.gov/) cuts under sequestration, that still amounts to an estimated \$45 billion in fiscal year 2026 and roughly \$535 billion through 2034, according to the [CBO](https://www.cbo.gov/). This would make financially stressed [Medicare](https://www.medicare.gov/) providers — including safety net hospitals and the more than 300 rural hospitals at immediate risk of closure — worse off than they already are. Shuttered facilities would threaten health care access for older adults and all community members alike.

To make matters worse, because the \$2.3 trillion deficit increase averages out to \$230 billion a year, the cuts to [Medicare](https://www.medicare.gov/) would still leave \$185 billion to be sequestered in fiscal year 2026. That money would have to come from all other nonexempt programs, including farm price supports, [Social Services Block Grant](https://acf.gov/ocs/programs/ssbg) funds and vocational rehabilitation programs, which support farmers, children, older people and people with disabilities. The [CBO](https://www.cbo.gov/) estimates, however, that the total funding for these other programs is only \$120 billion in that year. The funding for these other programs would be completely zeroed out, causing severe hardship to the many [Americans](https://www.usa.gov/) who are the beneficiaries of these programs.

[Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) has various ways of preventing the cuts to [Medicare](https://www.medicare.gov/) and other programs from triggering. Lawmakers could change the budget scorekeeping rules or tell [OMB](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/) to disregard the bill’s impact on the debt. But any attempt to get around [PAYGO](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title2/chapter20A&edition=prelim) inside of the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) tax giveaway bill would violate the [Congressional Budget Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/93rd-congress/house-bill/7130) and require 60 votes to waive in the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/). While [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) may find the votes to solve the problem in subsequent legislation, passage of a solution would be subject to filibuster in the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/). Opponents of the bill could threaten to withhold their votes from passing the solution unless the bill were repealed or changed.

Of course, if this ruinous giveaway to the rich were never enacted in the first place, such a solution would be unnecessary. But [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) are eager to gut lifesaving programs that millions of [Americans](https://www.usa.gov/) rely on to give tax breaks to the ultra-wealthy. And if that includes [Medicare](https://www.medicare.gov/), well so be it.

*The [CBO](https://www.cbo.gov/) said the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/)’s megabill would lead to \$500 billion in cuts to [Medicare](https://www.medicare.gov/). Two days later, 215 [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) voted for it anyway.*

By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

As the fight over the [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/)’ so-called [One Bigly Beautiful Bill Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text) unfolded, much of the focus turned to [Medicaif](https://www.medicaid.gov/), and for good reason. Despite [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [promise not to cut the health care program](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/promising-not-cut-medicaid-trump-starts-pointing-fine-print-rcna207937), the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) legislation would [cut roughly \$700 billion](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/budget-office-republicans-megabill-give-rich-richer-take-poor-rcna208175) from [Medicaif](https://www.medicaid.gov/) in the coming years, and with just hours remaining before the bill reached the floor, party leaders added [new and punitive Medicaid provisions](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/21/house-republicans-propose-disincentives-for-states-to-expand-medicaid-00364471) to shore up support from far-right members.

But as important as the future of [Medicaif](https://www.medicaid.gov/) is, the legislation’s impact on [Medicare](https://www.medicare.gov/) matters, too.

If people were to dig into the [1,000-page bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text) to look for the provisions related to [Medicare](https://www.medicare.gov/) cuts, they won’t find them. But there’s a difference between the literal text of the legislation and the practical effects of the legislation.

In fact, as [The Washington Post reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/05/21/medicare-cuts-big-beautiful-bill-republicans-house/), the [Congressional Budget Office](https://www.cbo.gov/) found that the [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/)’ megabill would add so many trillions of dollars to the national debt, “it could force nearly \$500 billion in cuts to [Medicare](https://www.medicare.gov/)” — with some cuts taking effect as early as next year. As the [Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) noted, the higher deficits would force budget officials “to mandate across-the-board spending cuts over that window that would hit the federal health insurance program for seniors and people with disabilities.”

> *When legislation significantly adds to the national debt, which already exceeds \$36.2 trillion, it triggers ‘sequestration,’ or compulsory budgetary reductions. In that scenario, [Medicare](https://www.medicare.gov/) cuts would be capped at 4 percent annually, or \$490 billion over 10 years, the CBO reported in response to a request from [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Brendan Boyle (D-PA)](https://boyle.house.gov/), the top [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) on the [Budget Committee](https://budget.house.gov/).*

Referencing [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/)’ [Pay-As-You-Go (“PAYGO”) Act](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title2/chapter20A&edition=prelim), [Boyle](https://boyle.house.gov/) said in a written statement, “This [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) budget bill is one of the most expensive — and dangerous — bills [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) has seen in decades. The nonpartisan [CBO](https://www.cbo.gov/) makes it clear: The deficit will explode so badly it will trigger automatic cuts, including over half a trillion dollars from [Medicare](https://www.medicare.gov/).”

The [Pennsylvania Democrat](https://boyle.house.gov/) added, “This is what [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) do — pay for massive tax breaks for billionaires by going after programs families rely on the most: Medicaid, food assistance, and now [Medicare](https://www.medicare.gov/). It’s reckless, dishonest, and deeply harmful to the middle class.”

Though it’s unlikely that [congressional](https://www.congress.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) read it, the [CBO](https://www.cbo.gov/) published [a relatively brief three-page summary](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61423) of its [Medicare](https://www.medicare.gov/) findings on Tuesday night, ahead of Thursday morning’s vote.

In fairness, [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) would have opportunities to pass separate legislation to mitigate the damage created by the [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/)’ agenda. Given that [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) members wouldn’t want to be responsible for massive [Medicare](https://www.medicare.gov/) cuts, such action would be likely.

But that doesn’t change the bottom line: The [CBO](https://www.cbo.gov/) told the [House](https://www.house.gov/) that the [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/)’ reconciliation package would lead to \$500 billion in cuts to [Medicare](https://www.medicare.gov/), and two days later, [215 House Republicans](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/whats-next-house-gop-megabill-trump-passes-rcna208461) voted for it anyway.
