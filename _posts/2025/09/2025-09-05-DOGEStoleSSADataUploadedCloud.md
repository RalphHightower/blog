The information stolen from the [Social Security Administration (SSA)](https://www.ssa.gov/) database contains everything that criminals need to set up fake identities and open credit cards, loans.

## [DOGE mishandled your Social Security data. Here‚Äôs what that means.](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/doge-social-security-data-whistleblower-trump-rcna228942)

*Our decades-old federal privacy laws have not kept pace with the many trends that have transformed our very online world.*

Sept. 5, 2025, 2:03 PM EDT

By [Evelyn Danforth-Scott](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evelyn-danforth-scott-a8b4b723/), [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) Staff Attorney with the [American Civil Liberties](https://www.aclu.org/) and [Cody Venzke](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cody-venzke-31141643/), senior policy counsel with the [American Civil Liberties](https://www.aclu.org/)

Last week, while many of us were enjoying the last days of summer, a whistleblower [disclosed shocking details](https://whistleblower.org/press-release/whistleblower-warns-of-possible-risks-to-americans-social-security-information/) indicating staffers with the so-called [Department of Government Efficiency](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/social-security-administration-phone-benefits-wait-doge-trump-rcna218252) [have been messing with Americans‚Äô most sensitive data](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/whistleblower-accuses-doge-team-endangering-critical-social-security-d-rcna227264). According to the whistleblower, [DOGE](https://doge.gov/) staffers [uploaded the entire catalogue of Social Security numbers](https://www.msnbc.com/the-weekend/watch/doge-whistleblower-resigns-after-claiming-trump-admin-put-americans-social-security-data-at-risk-246194245676) ‚Äî as well as individuals‚Äô full names, birth dates and addresses ‚Äî to an unauthorized online storage system that bypassed the agency‚Äôs standard security and oversight protocols.

This scandal may lack the pizzazz of the personality-driven dramas that dominate our current political moment. But its implications are difficult to overstate. The consequences of [Social Security number](https://www.ssa.gov/) theft are devastating. Bad actors can use these stolen numbers to run up debts in their victims‚Äô names, worm their way into bank accounts, steal government benefits and unlock even more private data. [Social Security numbers](https://www.ssa.gov/) are such a coveted tool for fraudsters that, according to one study, their presence in a cache of stolen data increases the odds of an identity theft attempt from a baseline risk of roughly 2% all the way to 97%.

> *Another federal whistleblower reported repeated attempts from an IP address in Russia to break in using [DOGE](https://doge.gov/) login credentials.*

The upshot is that [DOGE](https://doge.gov/)‚Äôs actions ‚Äî uploading every single [Social Security number](https://www.ssa.gov/) to an unauthorized storage environment, subject to unknown risk from unknown cybercriminals ‚Äî put all of us at risk of significant financial crimes. Whistleblower [Charles Borges](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cjborges/), the [Social Security Administration](https://www.ssa.gov/)‚Äôs now-former chief data officer, described the potential consequences as ‚Äúcatastrophic.‚Äù And he predicted it could lead to the federal government being forced to reissue a new number to every single American ‚Äî a measure that would inflict enormous costs and hassle on American households. According to [Borges](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cjborges/)‚Äô complaint, ‚Äúone of his superiors noted that possibility, underscoring the risk to the public.‚Äù

The [SSA](https://www.ssa.gov/) whistleblower‚Äôs concerns are more than just theoretical. After [DOGE](https://doge.gov/) staffers [received access to sensitive data](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/15/nx-s1-5355896/doge-nlrb-elon-musk-spacex-security) stored by the [National Labor Relations Board](https://www.nlrb.gov/), for example, another federal whistleblower [reported repeated attempts](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/krebsonsecurity.com/2025/04/whistleblower-doge-siphoned-nlrb-case-data/__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!r4Cc6S2FJ3RyfiXHgQKD0Ns5y_1fDikRngbgpx0VIfBtAKtOfhh0Tnt7Io6JT0c-iILsAFSzHilqCQG1NfuSwiQ$) from an IP address in [Russia](http://goverment.ru/) to break in using [DOGE](https://doge.gov/) login credentials. In 2014, foreign adversaries successfully stole data stored by the [Office of Personnel Management](https://www.opm.gov/), a heist [one House Republican-led report](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/oversight.house.gov/report/opm-data-breach-government-jeopardized-national-security-generation/__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!r4Cc6S2FJ3RyfiXHgQKD0Ns5y_1fDikRngbgpx0VIfBtAKtOfhh0Tnt7Io6JT0c-iILsAFSzHilqCQG10R9lZSA$) laid at the feet of [OPM](https://www.opm.gov/)‚Äôs failure to ‚Äúimplement basic cyber hygiene.‚Äù

Worse, [DOGE](https://doge.gov/)‚Äôs cavalier behavior at the [SSA](https://www.ssa.gov/) is not a one-off. It is part of a broader, administration-wide push to collect and consolidate Americans‚Äô private data. The federal government is trying to transfer [Social Security information](https://www.npr.org/2025/06/29/nx-s1-5409608/citizenship-trump-privacy-voting-database) to [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services](https://www.uscis.gov/), to allow [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) agents ‚Äú[direct access](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.452203/gov.uscourts.cand.452203.83.3.pdf)‚Äù to your [Medicaid](https://www.medicaid.gov/) data, and to [export taxpayer data](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-irs-share-tax-records-ice-dhs-deportations) in bulk to the [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/). It‚Äôs unclear what kinds of privacy and security protections are in place for any of these novel efforts.

Inevitably, some will brush off this scandal. They‚Äôll dismiss those raising alarm bells as prim-lipped defenders of the broken, nonresponsive institutions that voters sent [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) back to Washington to fix. If this administration has a mandate to bring change, maybe that includes letting the [DOGE](https://doge.gov/) whiz kids blast through standard data handling protocols so they can fix our federal bureaucracy.

That narrative is wrong. Jeopardizing every single American‚Äôs privacy is not a reasonable price to pay for the sake of moving fast and breaking things. That‚Äôs why, as lawyers with the [American Civil Liberties](https://www.aclu.org/), we‚Äôve filed more than 40 freedom of information requests across the federal government to unearth how [DOGE](https://doge.gov/) is handling sensitive data. And we sued the [Social Security Administration](https://www.ssa.gov/) earlier this year when it failed to disclose what [DOGE](https://doge.gov/) has been up to.

> *To truly protect Americans‚Äô private data, we need different laws on the books.*

This latest incident, however, does reinforce a valuable lesson: Our decades-old federal privacy laws have not kept pace with the many trends that have transformed our very online world into a playground for identity theft and privacy violations. Instead, we‚Äôre stuck with outdated protections that, among other shortcomings, assume there will always be an adult in the room, rest on nonbinding and easily revokable agency guidance, and fail to address the vast quantities of our online data that [federal agents routinely purchase](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/us-government-buys-data-americans-little-oversight-report-finds-rcna89035).

These antiquated laws don‚Äôt just underprotect individual privacy. They also hamper good-faith efforts to make the government work better. Laws passed in the 1970s or ‚Äô80s simply do not reflect modern-day understandings of how data drives governmental services ‚Äî leaving agencies that want to leverage data to improve federal programs to largely figure out for themselves how to safely collect, store and share Americans‚Äô sensitive information. The result is a maddening combination of vulnerability for individuals and sclerosis in government.

There is a better way. To begin, Americans should demand far more transparency around what [DOGE](https://doge.gov/) and the federal government are doing with our private data, including this administration‚Äôs accelerated consolidation of data across agencies. But [DOGE](https://doge.gov/)‚Äôs reckless handling of our [Social Security numbers](https://www.ssa.gov/) also should be a wake-up call: To truly protect Americans‚Äô private data, we need different laws on the books.

We need laws that reflect the digital world as it exists today. Laws that let the federal government work efficiently and responsively, using the best information and tools that 2025 has to offer. And, most fundamentally, laws that take our privacy and security seriously through protections like meaningful limitations on how the government can consolidate various data sources; rigorous safeguards for cross-government data sharing; a full accounting of the way commercial data collection feeds governmental surveillance; and enforcement mechanisms with teeth.

So, [DOGE](https://doge.gov/) mishandled your [Social Security number](https://www.ssa.gov/). It mishandled everyone‚Äôs [Social Security number](https://www.ssa.gov/). Let‚Äôs use this as a chance to finally drag data privacy laws into the 21st century.
