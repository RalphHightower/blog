## [Charlie Kirk's not dead and other conspiracy theories](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/charlie-kirk-not-dead-conspiracy-theories-online-suspect-rcna231698)

*The killing of the conservative activist unleashed a flood of conspiracy theories from the left and the right — some absurd, others politically expedient.*

Sept. 16, 2025, 2:11 PM EDT
By Brandy Zadrozny

Within hours of the [assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/charlie-kirk-killed-shooting-utah-political-violence-rcna230487), edited videos began to spread online. Some focused [on the moment Kirk was shot](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/charlie-kirk-shot-utah-turning-point-usa-rcna230441) — zooming in on the obviously fatal wound to make the strange claim that he hadn’t been killed at all: that the video was a fake, generated by computer, or that a squeeze of his right arm was proof he had popped a capsule to make it appear as if blood was pouring from his neck.

In videos that each racked up hundreds of thousands of views, one Illinois creator pointed to photos of the [Turning Point USA](https://www.tpusa.com/) founder making an “OK” sign with his hands: these symbols, they said, proved [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) had not only had faked his death, but that it also actually revealed his alignment with a demonic cabal that secretly controlled the world.

> *[Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) is, of course, senselessly and indisputably dead. That fact alone was enough to shatter reality, even for people outside the gravitational pull of internet conspiracy culture.*

[Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) is, of course, senselessly and indisputably dead. That fact alone was enough to shatter reality.

At 31, [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) was arguably the most popular and influential figure in right-wing politics outside of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) — for whom he acted as a strategist, the guy who brought young people into the MAGA movement and helped win [Arizona](https://www.az.gov/). To the religious right, he was a hero. [To many on the left](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/charlie-kirk-assassination-maga/), an avatar of [racism](https://www.salon.com/2025/08/04/how-charlie-kirk-turned-to-religion-to-level-up-his-racism/), [transphobia](https://www.advocate.com/voices/charlie-kirk-sanitize-opinion) and [misogyny.](https://msmagazine.com/2025/09/11/charlie-kirk-dead-feminism-gender-women-masculinity-violence-gun-control-shooting/). And to tens of thousands of young people, especially men, who packed his rallies and the millions more who watched his clips online, [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) was someone who could talk to anyone, win any argument and offered a vision of life filled with purpose and power. He [connected](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/15/rfk-kirk-architect-merger-trump-00564197) MAHA and MAGA and [sealed](https://nypost.com/2025/09/15/us-news/jd-vance-makes-surprising-admission-in-wake-of-charlie-kirks-death/) [Trump’s selection](https://nypost.com/2025/09/15/us-news/jd-vance-makes-surprising-admission-in-wake-of-charlie-kirks-death/) of [JD Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/[administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)/jd-vance/) for [vice president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/[administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)/jd-vance/). [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) was, as his podcast intro declared, “the voice of a generation” and, [many believed](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/charlie-kirk-death-turning-point-trump.html), a future president.

And then he was gone. Not just gone but stolen, executed on livestream in an act so violent, so graphic, that the only other event that comes close to its trauma in memory was [President John F. Kennedy](https://www.jfklibrary.org/)’s assassination — viewed by most in grainy footage that doesn’t approach the detailed horror of [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/)’s recorded murder, seen almost instantaneously by millions.

According to the most current information from law enforcement, the shooting appears to be the work of a single suspect: 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, [a bright electrician-in-training](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/12/us/politics/tyler-robinson-charlie-kirk.html) who was taken into custody 33 hours after the shooting and was formally charged in [Utah](https://ww) on Tuesday. [Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/who-tyler-robinson-charlie-kirk-suspect-814fd21f?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAhfZdbUtFWjv8MnodnksHkyFc6jIb8OVcx08SHfbIfBsURQR-_8qmOZy2myDx0%3D&gaa_ts=68c9a470&gaa_sig=20z1JSxTjR5kWM1qbDXQsnG0QGQX3pBvNLdYS2FH9O92Bm10iCMypeiU4erT60HYizdRyDTDPYfr59MdfBPkVg%3D%3D) Robinson was motivated by and “deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology,” citing statements from family members and messages sent to friends.

Yet, almost immediately after [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) was shot, a wave of conspiracy theories from both the right and the left rushed in to cloud that reality — to deny it outright or to twist it into something politically useful. This kind of [conspiracy theorizing](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-second-shooter-water-tower-conspiracy-theory-rcna163154) was inevitable — what researchers call [collective sensemaking](https://www.cip.uw.edu/2024/07/15/trump-assassination-rumors-collective-sensemaking/) as we try to understand what we’ve just experienced. It’s a process that happens in two parts: the assembling of evidence and the framing.

These theories drew on hundreds of photos and videos captured by rallygoers, organizers, federal law enforcement and news outlets. Users dissected the videos, marking them with red circles and arrows. In one video, a man adjusting his hat was labeled a conspirator signaling a hitman. In others, [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) was said to have been shot not from above but from behind, with the assassin identified alternately as a man tugging his sleeve or a fuzzy figure in white.

Conspiracy theories live on a spectrum of possibility and politics. Some built around the [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) assassination are far-flung ones, pushed by flat-earthers and false-flag obsessives. Others, more mainstream, have without strong evidence pointed blame at [Israel](https://x.com/jacksonhinklle/status/1966055431601574351), farther-right [antisemitic activists](https://bsky.app/search?q=groyper+kirk), imaginary underground [progressive terrorist organizations](https://x.com/_johnnymaga/status/1967628873396523218) and [Donald Trump himself](https://x.com/Shayan86/status/1965993574656520614). Some were likely motivated by belief, but others perhaps by a desire for internet attention, for entertainment or for political purposes yet to be seen.

“[Charlie Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/)’s assassination was not just some kid,” former [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) adviser Steve Bannon told his [War Room](https://warroom.org/) listeners Monday, inviting them to watch surveillance video of the alleged shooter descending a roof, footage that has been held up as evidence [by some MAGA influencers](https://extra.ie/2025/09/14/news/something-is-wrong-kirk-assassination) that [Kash Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) is hiding something.

“It seems like we’re being spoon-fed a narrative, and this audience is not going to take it, and we’re not going to allow the martyr [Charlie Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) to have a situation like a grassy knoll that decades and decades and decades later, we’re still arguing about this. We’ve got to get to the bottom of it.”

It is fitting, maybe, that so many conspiracy theories have engulfed [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) upon his death. In life, [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) entertained conspiracy theories, trafficked in them and benefited from their unchecked spread. Over the years on his podcast, [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) leaned into conspiracy theories including the [the “great reset”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFvE3NQaqms&ab_channel=RealLifewithJackHibbs) (a [globalist plot](https://www.isdglobal.org/explainers/the-great-reset/) to control the world) and [the “great replacement”](https://www.mediamatters.org/white-nationalism/while-calling-military-be-deployed-los-angeles-charlie-kirk-uses-chart-sourced) ([a Democratic plot](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-is-great-replacement-theory-and-how-does-it-fuel-racist-violence) to erase the white race). On his podcast where he fashioned himself as a Christian Rush Limbaugh, [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) spread [claims](https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/no-evidence-haitian-immigrants-stealing-eating-pets-ohio-2024-09-10/) that Haitians in [Springfield](https://springfieldohio.gov/), [Ohio](https://www.ohio.gov/), were “[taking people’s pets and eating them](https://www.mediamatters.org/charlie-kirk/charlie-kirk-amplifies-debunked-social-media-rumor-about-haitian-immigrants),” that American men [had been purposefully “feminized,”](https://thecharliekirkshow.com/podcasts/the-charlie-kirk-show/the-death-of-western-testosterone) that the media was [hiding something](https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/31/politics/pelosi-attack-right-wing-conspiracy-theories-invs) about the [attack on Paul Pelosi](https://rumble.com/v1qs7n2-a-naked-smear-of-maga-don-buldoc-dan-cox-chadwick-moore-the-charlie-kirk-sh.html?e9s=src_v1_cbl%2Csrc_v1_ucp_a), and that [President Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) [had intentionally ignored weather disasters](https://www.mediamatters.org/charlie-kirk/charlie-kirk-falsely-claims-there-has-been-no-federal-response-maui-wildfires) so they could be used to promote policies that addressed climate change. [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) pushed debunked theories that a nebulous group of government “theys” conspired to [steal elections](https://www.tapesearch.com/episode/a-full-defense-of-2-000-mules-with-dinesh-d-souza/BajmXj4GtxDRfGkTiNSbmY?h=A%20Full%20Defense%20of%202%2C000%20Mules%20with%20Dinesh%20D%27Souza), set up [peaceful patriots to attack the Capitol on Jan. 6](https://www.mediamatters.org/january-6-insurrection/here-are-key-right-wing-media-figures-who-rewrote-history-january-6#:~:text=Charlie%20Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/)%2C%20who%20co%2Dfounded%20the%20right%2Dwing%20organization%20Turning%20Point%20USA%2C%20has%20repeatedly%20downplayed%20the%20insurrection%20and%20accused%20Ray%20Epps%20of%20being%20a%20federal%20agent.) and forced [forced deadly vaccines](https://www.mediamatters.org/charlie-kirk/charlie-kirks-anti-vax-campaign) on unwitting Americans.

> *At the same time, [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) surrounded himself with conspiracy theorists — a growing influence of power within the conservative establishment.*

At the same time, [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) surrounded himself with conspiracy theorists — a growing influence of power within the conservative establishment — including [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), Robert F. Kennedy Jr., [Candace Owens](https://www.candaceowens.com/) and radio host [Alex Jones](https://www.infowars.com/), to name a few.

[Jones](https://www.infowars.com/) and [Owens](https://www.candaceowens.com/) now count among the conspiracy creators focused on [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/)’s death.

“Who called the hit on [Charlie](https://www.charliekirk.com/)?” [Owens](https://www.candaceowens.com/) [posted on X](https://x.com/RealCandaceO/status/1966125717713821907) the day after the shooting.

[Owens](https://www.candaceowens.com/), his [longtime friend](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/youtube-tested-trump-approved-how-candace-owens-suddenly-became-loudest-n885166) and [former employee](https://thegrio.com/2019/05/07/candace-owens-quits-turning-point-usa-after-members-demand-she-resign/), has spent the last several days publicly grieving while posting about “some very powerful billionaires” that she said [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) was facing pressure from over [his wavering support for Israel](https://youtu.be/1WuOtvdV5W0?t=3810). In her [online show](https://www.youtube.com/live/czVBmqZP6Ss) Monday, she also suggested something nefarious about the [FBI]()’s handling of the crime.

“If they had wanted to catch [Charlie](https://www.charliekirk.com/)’s killer, they would have immediately publicized all pictures and videos and the internet would have solved it in minutes,” [Owens](https://x.com/RealCandaceO/status/1966326051191095787) posted. “The desire was never there.”

As is his custom, [Jones](https://www.infowars.com/) immediately leapt on [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/)’s death. But this time, he didn’t theorize, [as he had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FinFZKy_tmA&ab_channel=Law%26CrimeNetwork) with children murdered in their elementary school, that [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/)’s death was a production of the government to rip away gun rights. Instead, he claimed this was an execution overseen and commanded [by “a trans death cult.”](https://x.com/RealAlexJones/status/1967626447092396312) (The suspect was in a romantic relationship with a roommate who is transgender and who is cooperating with authorities, [Gov. Cox said](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-9-14-25-gov-spencer-cox/story?id=125542448) last week. Officials have not yet suggested that Robinson was motivated by trans issues.)

“The Soros strike force has been activated,” [Jones](https://www.infowars.com/) [posted Monday,](https://x.com/RealAlexJones/status/1967627010693636561), referring to the liberal billionaire donor.

The framing of [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/)’s death, as staged or part of a larger plot, may not hold. But a more insidious narrative — one less easily debunked or written over with facts learned during a criminal case against Robinson — is already being amplified by the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/). Fueled by raw emotion and few facts, this frame is shaping into something likely to be more durable and destructive.

On a special episode of [The Charlie Kirk Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngofqx9EfcM&ab_channel=CharlieKirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/)), broadcast Monday from a wood-paneled office in the White House complex, the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s most senior officials joined guest host [Vice President JD Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/[administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)/jd-vance/) to eulogize [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/). Flanked by American and vice presidential flags, deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller sipped tea and pointed to a shadowy alliance of progressive organizations, funders and activists [who, he claimed,](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/stephen-miller-charlie-kirk-podcast-appearance-jd-vance-rcna231444) are ultimately responsible for [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/)’s killing. He cited this narrative as justification to unleash the power of the federal government upon its contrived threats so that, [as Vance said](https://www.youtube.com/live/ngofqx9EfcM?t=1363), something like [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/)’s assassination would never happen again.

“With God as my witness, we are going to use every resource we have at the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/), [Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/) and throughout this government to identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy these networks and make America safe again,” Miller said, defining the unnamed networks as “the organized doxxing campaigns, the organized riots, the organized street violence, the organized campaigns of dehumanization, vilification, posting people’s addresses, combining that with messaging designed to trigger, incite violence and the actual organized cells that carry out and facilitate the violence.”

This narrative is the ultimate conspiracy theory. That its enemy is so fundamentally undefined is the source of its power. The characters in this story are so broad that [it can be weaponized](https://bsky.app/profile/chrismurphyct.bsky.social/post/3lyswocxuwc2p) against any and every perceived political enemy. It already has been.

The day after [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) was shot, anonymous self-described political operatives registered a website, “[CharliesMurderers.com](https://archive.is/EaIAG)” which crowdsourced screenshots and identifying details to accuse people of celebrating his murder. People featured on the site — whose remarks were often misrepresented — [have reported receiving death threats](https://www.wired.com/story/right-wing-activists-are-targeting-people-for-allegedly-celebrating-charlie-kirks-death/) and being [fired from their jobs](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/13/charlie-kirk-shooting-people-fired-social-media). The anonymous organizers, who solicit donations, claim to have more than 60,000 submissions and plan to publish soon. Meanwhile, [Cabinet secretaries](https://www.whitehouse.gov/[administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)/the-cabinet/) and the heads of [federal departments](https://www.usa.gov/agency-index) have been tasked with identifying organizations they claim fund and incite left-wing violence, [according to](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/15/us/politics/jd-vance-charlie-kirk-show.html?smid=sl-share) [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/). [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) [claimed Monday](https://abcnews.go.com/US/attorney-general-pam-bondi-claims-left-wing-radicals/story?id=125604411), without evidence, that “left-wing radicals” killed [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/), and that “they” would be held to account.

It’s a tactic I imagine [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) would have approved of. It was [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) who built the professor “[watchlist](https://www.chronicle.com/article/charlie-kirks-watch-list-made-some-professors-lives-a-living-hell),” intended to expose alleged leftist bias but which ultimately led to doxxing and death threats for hundreds of academics. It was [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) who [argued](https://www.mediamatters.org/media/4003170) that the only way to heal the country’s political divisions was for conservatives to “win.” [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) was the kind of strategist who understood when to lean into a grand conspiracy theory for the greater MAGA good.

[Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) helped cultivate a modern conservative worldview that declared itself at war with the left. In death, he has become the main character in its central conspiracy theory.
