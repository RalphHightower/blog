## [Reported Epstein emails raise more questions about Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/epstein-trump-emails-maxwell-bloomberg-report-rcna230711)

*A new [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/) report citing a trove of Epstein’s emails from 2002 to 2022 poses additional questions about the late sex offender’s ties to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).*

Two decades’ worth of emails that reportedly belonged to Jeffrey Epstein shine light on the late sex offender’s relationship with accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell — and raise new questions about his relationships with [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and other well-connected political figures.

[Bloomberg News reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-jeffrey-epstein-emails-ghislaine-maxwell/) that it unearthed emails from Epstein’s personal [Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/) account from 2002 through 2022, three years after he died in jail. The emails haven’t been independently verified by [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) or [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/).

While there are no smoking guns that expose potential accomplices, [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/) certainly seems to have revealed creepy emails from a lecherous man. For example:

> *One moment, Epstein is musing about the “genetics of beauty” with a respected neuroscientist, or showering praise on the women in his life. “YOu are the most important person to me,” he wrote to one of his assistants, Nadia Marcinkova, whose lawyer has said she was a victim of Epstein’s sexual abuse. The next, he is berating the same woman in a 425-word diatribe for her reluctance to dance, work out, engage in “fun sex things,” and manage his stress — “you should be ashamed of yourself” — or registering displeasure after receiving a photograph of a 21-year-old woman from one of his female contacts asking “what do you think”: “fat and asian sorry,” he replied.*

Pretty gross.

Other emails reflect the intimate relationship between Epstein and Maxwell, including more than 200 sent in 2008 — the year Epstein was sentenced to prison for procuring a minor for prostitution and soliciting a prostitute. The report even cites a few emails that refer to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), including one in which Epstein tells Maxwell to remove [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s name from a list of more than 50 politicians and business leaders — [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/) said it couldn’t determine the list’s purpose.

And another email, from Maxwell to Epstein in 2007, includes [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) among the people whom an unknown “they” might approach for some reason — an allusion the outlet says may have been related to a team of reporters. The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) tried to downplay the report, telling [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/): “This is just more stupid, fake news playing into the hands of the [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) Hoax trying to link [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and Epstein.”

The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s effort to deny or downplay his yearslong ties to Epstein [have gotten particularly absurd this week](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-house-jeffrey-epstein-birthday-book-donald-trump-rcna230024), after the [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Oversight Committee](https://oversight.house.gov/) released a bawdy note addressed to Epstein that purportedly bears [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s signature. (The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) denies writing the note and says the signature isn’t his.)

And this new report from [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/) doesn’t exactly put the Epstein issue to bed for the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), either.
