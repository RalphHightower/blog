*[Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) have largely been able to steer clear of the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. The [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) leader, however, unexpectedly forced the issue.*

Sept. 11, 2025, 9:40 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

In recent weeks and months, congressional efforts to force disclosure of the Jeffrey Epstein files have largely concentrated in the [House](https://www.house.gov/), where there is a bipartisan discharge petition seeking signatures. But as it turns out, the upper chamber can tackle the controversy, too, despite the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) majority. [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/schumer-epstein-senate-vote-rcna230389):

> *The [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)-led [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) narrowly voted Wednesday to defeat an amendment introduced by [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Minority Leader](https://bioguide.congress.gov/search/bio/S000148) [Chuck Schumer (D-NY)](https://www.schumer.senate.gov/), to compel the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) to release all of the Jeffrey Epstein files. The vote was 51-49 in favor of tabling the amendment. Two [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) — [Rand Paul (T-KY)](https://www.paul.senate.gov/) and [Josh Hawley (T-MO)](https://www.hawley.senate.gov/) — joined all 47 [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)s in voting against tabling the amendment.*

For much of the year, [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) senators have been content to avoid the Epstein scandal, which made it all the more notable when Schumer surprised his colleagues. Taking advantage of senators’ work on a sweeping defense policy package, known as the [National Defense Authorization Act (or NDAA)](https://www.congress.gov/committee-report/119th-congress/senate-report/39/1), the [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) [teed up a procedural vote](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/09/10/congress/chuck-schumer-senate-epstein-vote-00555454) on an amendment to direct [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) to make public any available documents that the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) possesses related to Epstein and his associates.

“There’s been so much lying, obfuscation, cover-ups — the American people need to see everything that’s in the Epstein file,” [Schumer](https://www.schumer.senate.gov/) told reporters Wednesday.

Not surprisingly, the effort fell short, but the fact that two [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) voted with [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)s on this was a timely reminder about the divisions within the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) over an issue that [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) can’t make go away.

What’s more, the minority leader is hardly the only [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) working on the Epstein controversy. [The New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/09/10/us/trump-news/199c08d9-260e-5358-8f91-582c8aef30ac?smid=url-share):

> *[Senator](https://www.senate.gov/) [Ron Wyden (D-OR)](https://www.wyden.senate.gov/), who has led an investigation into some of Jeffrey Epstein’s financial dealings, introduced a bill to compel the [Treasury Department](https://home.treasury.gov/) to turn over copies of all suspicious activity reports filed by banks for thousands of transactions by Epstein and dozens of his associates or business partners. [Wyden](https://www.wyden.senate.gov/), the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Finance Committee](http://www.finance.senate.gov/)’s ranking member, previously sent letters to [Treasury officials](https://home.treasury.gov/) demanding copies of the reports but was rebuffed.*

Among the banks whose reports [Wyden](https://www.wyden.senate.gov/) is trying to obtain is [JPMorgan Chase](https://www.jpmorgan.com/), which served as Epstein’s primary banker for many years and has been [accused of helping to enable](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/08/magazine/jeffrey-epstein-jp-morgan.html) to enable Epstein’s activities. (The bank has denied any wrongdoing.)

As for the other end of Capitol Hill, [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/)’ newest member, [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [James Walkinshaw (D-VA17)](https://walkinshaw.house.gov/), was sworn in the day after winning this week’s special election, and he promptly signed the pending discharge petition related to disclosing the Epstein files.

As [Politico reported](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/09/10/congress/walkinshaw-signs-jeffrey-epstein-discharge-petition-massie-khanna-00556162), the bipartisan duo spearheading the effort — [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Thomas Massie (T-KY4)](https://massie.house.gov/) and [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Ro Khanna (D-CA17)](https://khanna.house.gov/) — now need only one more [House](https://www.house.gov/) member’s signature to clinch 218 signatures, which would trigger a process [House](https://www.house.gov/) [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) leaders would be powerless to stop.

Proponents are expected to reach the benchmark later this month with a Sept. 23 special election in [Arizona](https://www.az.gov/) to replace the late [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Raúl Grijalva (D-AZ7) – Deceased](https://clerk.house.gov/members/AZ07/vacancy), although it’s possible that some of the [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) who’ve already signed onto the discharge petition could be pressured to change their minds. Watch this space.
