## [Organizers in Chicago shift Labor Day rally to protest looming federal takeover](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/chicago-labor-day-rally-protest-federal-takeover-rcna228118)

*The focus of a rally against billionaires, led by the [Chicago Teachers Union](https://www.ctulocal1.org/), has pivoted toward protesting the possible militarization of the city.*

Sept. 1, 2025, 6:00 AM EDT
By Erum Salam

With [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) threatening to [“straighten out Chicago”](https://x.com/BulwarkOnline/status/1958951283215225042) and flood the city with federal law enforcement, local groups in the city are preparing to respond.

Organizers in [Chicago](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en.html) already had plans for a [“Workers over Billionaires” rally](https://www.ctulocal1.org/posts/labor-day-2025-announcement/) rally — [one of nearly 1,000 similar rallies](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/29/workers-over-billionaires-trump-protest) taking place across the country on Labor Day — long before [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) announced his intention to [militarize American cities](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-militarized-cities-lot-people-are-saying-maybe-d-dictator-rcna227039). But now those threats have become the focus.

The [Chicago Teachers Union](https://www.ctulocal1.org/), which is leading the rally, has prepared a plan that includes educational materials so resident)s know their rights, a family safety network and a patrol.

“I’ve seen [L.A.](https://lacity.gov/), and I’ve seen [Washington, D.C.](https://dc.gov/), and the pretext is always this phantom undocumented individual. And then after they established the pretext, they set up shop in Black communities, and they violate the constitutional right of Black citizens,” [CTU](https://www.ctulocal1.org/) [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Stacy Davis Gates](https://www.ctulocal1.org/about/) told [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/).

[Davis Gates](https://www.ctulocal1.org/about/) said she mostly fears for the safety of the city’s youth should a federal takeover happen, which she said would be “scary.” She added that the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s plans would not serve the community.

“The federal government can do a lot to help [Chicago](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en.html),” [Davis Gates](https://www.ctulocal1.org/about/) said. “We’re not asking for a militarized force. We’re asking for [SNAP benefits](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program) to be restored. We’re asking for the [Department of Education](http://www.ed.gov/) to be funded and resourced so that special education children have recourse when their school districts fail to educate them appropriately.”

The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has [reportedly already requested](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-chicago-naval-base-rcna227800) that a military base near [Chicago](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en.html) be available to provide support for immigration operations in the area.

As of Thursday, [Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker](https://wgntv.com/news/chicago-news/pritzker-says-he-has-received-no-calls-from-the-white-house-as-chicago-grapples-with-a-possible-national-guard-deployment/) said he received “no calls from the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), from the federal government, from anybody who might be in charge of some sort of troop movement.”

[Illinois](https://www.illinois.gov/) [Attorney General](https://www.illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/) [Kwame Raoul told MSNBC’s Ana Cabrera](https://www.msnbc.com/ana-cabrera-reports/watch/illinois-ag-on-trump-threat-to-send-troops-to-chicago-nobody-wants-to-live-in-a-military-state-245881925709) on Wednesday that “there are prerequisites to federalizing the [National Guard](https://www.nationalguard.mil/)” and said “no circumstances exist that would require [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to send the [National Guard](https://www.nationalguard.mil/) into [Chicago](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en.html).”

“We didn’t elect a king,” he added. “We elected a [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).”
