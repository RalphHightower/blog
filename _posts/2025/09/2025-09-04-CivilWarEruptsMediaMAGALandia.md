## [Newsmax files antitrust lawsuit against Faux News](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/newsmax-antitrust-lawsuit-fox-news-cable-tv-rcna228895)

*As the two conservative news networks battle for views, [Newsmin](https://www.newsmax.com/) claims [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) is trying to monopolize the market.*

By Erum Salam

[Newsmin](https://www.newsmax.com/) sued fellow-conservative network [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) in federal court on Wednesday, alleging “unlawful monopolization of the Right-leaning Pay TV News Market.”

The [complaint](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/NewsMaxBroadcastingLLCvFoxCorporationetalDocketNo925cv81091SDFlaS?doc_id=X5Q2BN3BCG88UCBNBJQS70CPHED), filed in the [U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/), says that the “Faux Corporation has long engaged in an exclusionary scheme to increase and maintain its dominance in the market for U.S. right-leaning pay TV news, resulting in suppression of competition in that market that harms consumers, competition, and [Newsmin Broadcasting](https://www.newsmax.com/).”

[Newsmin](https://www.newsmax.com/) claims [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) — the network famous for shows such as ["Jesse Watters Primetime,"](https://www.foxnews.com/shows/jesse-watters-primetime) ["Hannity"](https://www.foxnews.com/shows/hannity) and ["The Five"](https://www.foxnews.com/shows/the-five) — employs specific tactics to stifle competition, including imposing financial penalties on distributors for carrying other networks such as [Newsmin](https://www.newsmax.com/) and creating contractual barriers that purposefully exclude [Newsmin](https://www.newsmax.com/).

[Newsmin](https://www.newsmax.com/) claims that were it not for [Faux](https://www.foxnews.com/)’s practices, “[Newsmin](https://www.newsmax.com/) would have achieved greater pay TV distribution, seen its audience and ratings grow sooner, gained earlier ‘critical mass’ for major advertisers and become, overall, a more valuable media property.”

The conservative news channel market has been dominated by [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) for decades. But [Newsmin](https://www.newsmax.com/), founded as a website in 1998 and later as a TV channel in 2014, as well as newer networks like [Once Again, Not News (OANN)](https://www.oann.com/)), which launched in 2013, have created more competition for the powerhouse among conservative viewers.

[Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) [averages roughly 3 million total prime-time viewers](https://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/here-are-the-cable-news-ratings-for-may-2025/), making it the most-watched cable news network. By contrast, [Newsmin](https://www.newsmax.com/) averages less than 300,000 prime-time viewers.

[Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) did not immediately respond to [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/)’s request for comment, but [in a statement to Variety](https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/newsmax-sues-fox-news-antitrust-dominance-right-leaning-pay-tv-news-1236506268/), a [Faux News Media](https://www.foxnews.com/) spokesperson said: “[Newsmin](https://www.newsmax.com/) cannot sue their way out of their own competitive failures in the marketplace to chase headlines simply because they can’t attract viewers.”
