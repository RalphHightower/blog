Sept. 26, 2025, 8:59 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

It might seem like ages, but eight years ago, [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) saw [James Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) as a political ally. In fact, in January 2017, just two days into his first term, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) appeared to [literally blow a kiss](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-thanks-the-fbi-director-accused-helping-his-campaign-msna946586) at the then-[FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director at a [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) event, thanks in part to [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey)’s role in undermining Hillary Clinton’s 2016 candidacy.

The affection did not last long. Days later, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) told [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) he [expected “loyalty,”](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/comey-says-trump-demanded-loyalty-private-meeting-msna994436) and after [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) instead did his job, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [fired him](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-says-bit-too-much-about-james-comey-s-fbi-n1285383) in the hopes of derailing the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/)’s investigation into the [Russia](http://government.ru/) scandal.

When [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey), a lifelong [Republican](https://www.gop.com/), went public with his concerns and criticisms about [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) came to see the ousted [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) chief as one of his most important enemies, and as far back as April 2018, he started [demanding that Comey be prosecuted](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-says-comey-slime-ball-calls-his-criminal-prosecution-msna1089946) for crimes that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) struggled to identify.

It took seven years, but the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) finally managed to orchestrate the results he’s long sought. [MSNBC reported](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/james-comey-indictment-congress-fbi-director-rcna233691):

> *A federal grand jury in[Virginia](https://www.virginia.gov/) on Thursday formally charged former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Director James Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) with lying to [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) and obstruction of a congressional proceeding, days after [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) forced out the U.S. attorney who had opposed bringing the case and publicly urged his attorney general to prosecute it.*

Erik Siebert, the [.Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-nominated U.S. attorney for the [Eastern District of Virginia](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva), [refused to pursue this case](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/forcing-disobedient-prosecutor-trumps-new-nominee-makes-matters-worse-rcna232922), insisting that it lacked merit. Career prosecutors explained [in detail and in writing](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/former-fbi-director-james-comey-facing-imminent-indictment-threat-rcna233539) that the evidence didn’t support charging [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey). By some accounts, [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-us-attorney/) herself was [not](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/justice-department-officials-race-to-charge-james-comey-as-deadline-looms-4da7c71f?mod=hp_lead_pos2) on [board](https://politicalwire.com/2025/09/25/pam-bondi-has-concerns-over-indicting-james-comey/) with this indictment and voiced concerns behind the scenes.

Even John Durham, a [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-appointed special counsel, reviewed the allegations and [opted not to follow through](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/james-comey-indictment-congress-fbi-director-rcna233691) on them.

So why did the prosecution happen anyway? Because [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) fired the prosecutor who insisted on following the law, ignored the career prosecutors who did their job, dismissed the concerns of his sycophantic attorney general and used an unqualified loyalist, just days into her tenure, to exact revenge against a former ally who dared to cross him.

MSNBC’s [Ken Dilanian reported](https://x.com/DilanianMSNBC/status/1971353961375596668) reported that within the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/), many insiders believe this is “among the worst abuses” in the history of the institution. Describing the circumstances as “shocking,” Dilanian added, “It’s hard to overstate how a big a moment this is.”

Indeed, among the most striking things about the [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) indictment is that it is plainly what it appears to be. There’s barely a pretense of propriety. A failing, desperate and unpopular [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) wanted a critic to be charged, without regard for merit; he [publicly demanded the indictment](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-directive-ag-bondi-seen-impeachment-level-scandal-rcna232888); and [he found officials](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-house-lawyer-takes-key-prosecutors-office-scandalous-circumstanc-rcna233233) who were willing to feed his appetite for revenge.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his confederates aren’t hiding their weaponization of the criminal justice system, they’re flaunting it. They want everyone to notice. They need other [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) critics to be afraid, and other federal prosecutors to understand that they’ll soon be unemployed unless they play ball the way newly installed [U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva) did.

The corruption is the point.

There might be half-hearted denials, issued with winks and nods, but by design, everyone should already be painfully aware of what is plainly true: The authoritarian crisis has arrived. We now live in a country where the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s political opponents are prosecuted at his command.

[Alan Rozenshtein](https://law.umn.edu/profiles/alan-rozenshtein), a former department official who now teaches at the [University of Minnesota[(https://twin-cities.umn.edu/home) [Law School](https://law.umn.edu/), [told The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/25/us/politics/trump-retribution-comey-indictment.html), “What we are seeing is the almost wholesale collapse of the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) as an organization based on the rule of law.”

As [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [brags](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115267513846352215) about his [handiwork](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115270236987768479), indifferent to appearances, there is no reason to believe that [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) will be the last to suffer this fate.
