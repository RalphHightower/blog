## [Former CDC directors: RFK Jr. is ‘unlike anything our country has ever experienced’](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/former-cdc-directors-rfk-jr-anything-country-ever-experienced-rcna228574)

*There is no precedent for nine former [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/) chiefs linking arms and alerting the public to a public health menace like [Robert F. Kennedy Jr.](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html)*

Sept. 2, 2025, 12:41 PM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

By any fair measure, last week was brutal for the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/), following months of politically imposed setbacks. Indeed, it was on Wednesday afternoon when [Team Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [ousted Susan Monarez](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/cdc-susan-monarez-rfk-jr-resignation-rcna227699) as the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/)’s director — without cause and after less than a month on the job — sparking [a series of resignations](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/cdc-susan-monarez-rfk-jr-resignation-rcna227699) from many of the agency’s most respected and important leaders.

Soon after, it was common to see reports quoting [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/) insiders referring to the agency [in the past tense](https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/28/cdc-crisis-what-next-public-health/). [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) published a report with a headline and subhead that immediately generated some attention: “Will the [C.D.C.](https://www.cdc.gov/) Survive? [Robert F. Kennedy Jr.](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html)’s assault may have dealt lasting damage to the agency, experts fear, with harsh consequences for public health.”

A day later, former [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/) Director Dr. Tom Frieden appeared on MSNBC and [told viewers](https://www.msnbc.com/the-weekend-primetime/watch/fmr-cdc-director-says-you-can-no-longer-trust-the-cdc-website-never-thought-i-would-see-the-day-246242373686), “I never thought I would see the day when you couldn’t trust what’s on the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/) website, but that day has come.”

That was soon followed by a [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) op-ed co-authored by Frieden and several others who had held the same office. [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/former-cdc-directors-rfk-jr-dangerous-new-york-times-rcna228374):

> *[Health and Human Services](https://www.hhs.gov/) [Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html)’s leadership is ‘unlike anything our country has ever experienced,’ nine former directors and acting directors of the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/) wrote in a scathing guest essay Monday for [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/). ... Their tenures date to the late 1970s and span [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) and [Republican](https://www.gop.com) administrations, including [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s first term.*

The existence of the opinion piece is itself notable: There is no precedent for nine former [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/) chiefs — including Anne Schuchat, who served as an acting director during [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s first term — linking arms and alerting the public to a public health menace like this.

But just as notable, if not more so, is the written condemnation itself. Under a headline that read, “We Ran the [C.D.C.](https://www.cdc.gov/): [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) Is Endangering Every American’s Health,” [the nonet was unreserved in its criticisms](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/01/opinion/cdc-leaders-kennedy.html) of the anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist who is currently serving as the nation’s health secretary.

“[Mr. Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) has fired thousands of federal health workers and severely weakened programs designed to protect Americans from cancer, heart attacks, strokes, lead poisoning, injury, violence and more,” they wrote. “Amid the largest measles outbreak in the United States in a generation, he’s [focused on](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/health/measles-treatments-vaccines-kennedy.html) unproven treatments while downplaying vaccines. He [canceled](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/05/health/rfk-jr-vaccine-funding.html) investments in promising medical research that will leave us ill prepared for future health emergencies. He [replaced](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/11/well/vaccines-cdc-rfk-jr.html) experts on federal health advisory committees with unqualified individuals who share his dangerous and unscientific views. He announced the end of U.S. support for global vaccination programs that protect millions of children and keep Americans safe, [citing](https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/02/rfk-jr-vaccines-former-cdc-director-tom-frieden-says-kennedy-mangled-science-in-gavi-decision/) flawed research and making inaccurate statements. And he [championed](https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1940089073391018352) federal legislation that will cause millions of people with health insurance through [Medicaid](https://www.mediccsid.gov/) to [lose](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2025-06/Wyden-Pallone-Neal_Letter_6-4-25.pdf) their coverage. Firing Dr. Monarez — which led to the resignations of top [C.D.C.](https://www.cdc.gov/). officials — adds considerable fuel to this raging fire.”

For his part, [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) responded with an opinion piece of his own, [writing for The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-were-restoring-public-trust-in-the-cdc-6f26c176) that he’s been directed to “restore that trust and return the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/) to its core mission.”

Of course, if that is [RFK Jr.](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html)’s principal goal, he’s failing spectacularly.
