## [In Epstein case, Mike Johnson backs off claim that Trump was an FBI ‘informant’](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/epstein-case-mike-johnson-backs-claim-trump-was-fbi-informant-rcna229828)

*When the [House](https://www.house.gov/) [speaker](https://speaker.house.gov/) claimed that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) was an [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) “informant” in the Epstein case, it raised some awkward questions. Then he walked it back.*

In some fringe circles, there are still some who believe that [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is secretly a hero in the case against Jeffrey Epstein. As these conspiracy theorists see it, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) worked quietly with law enforcement behind the scenes to bring his former friend to justice — but the Republican is simply too modest to brag about it.

These foolish claims have never made any sense, which made it rather surprising when [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Speaker](https://speaker.house.gov/) [Mike Johnson (T-LA4)](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) told reporters on Capitol Hill last week — out loud, on the record and on camera — that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was “an [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) informant” in the case against Epstein.

The comment raised more questions than answers. If [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was an informant for federal law enforcement, what precipitated such an arrangement? If the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) worked with the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) to help, in [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/)’s words, “take down” a sex trafficking ring, why has this been kept secret?

Similarly, two days after the [Louisiana congressman](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) made the comment, [Thomas Massie (T-KY4)](https://massie.house.gov/) appeared on [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/)’ [“This Week”](https://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek) [and asked](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-9-7-25-ukrainian-president-volodymyr/story?id=125328724), “If [the Epstein scandal is] a ‘hoax,’ why was [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) an informant to a hoax?”

A few hours later, [The Washington Post reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/09/07/trump-epstein-johnson-fbi/):

> *[House](https://www.house.gov/) [Speaker](https://speaker.house.gov/) [Mike Johnson (T-LA4)](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) on Sunday backed off his claim that [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was an [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) informant in the case of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. ... On Sunday, his office released a statement modifying that claim.*

“The [Speaker](https://speaker.house.gov/) is reiterating what the victims’ attorney said, which is that [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) — who kicked Epstein out of [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) — was the only one more than a decade ago willing to help prosecutors expose Epstein for being a disgusting child predator,” the statement from Johnson’s office read.

Of course, there’s a big difference between working as an [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) “informant” and being “willing” to assist with an investigation, although the clarification might need additional clarifying, since it remains an open question how, when and whether the [president](https://www.house.gov/) actually tried to “help prosecutors.”

As for the bigger picture, a bill called the [Epstein Files Transparency Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/581/text), which would compel the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) to disclose more documents related to the Epstein case, is still pending on Capitol Hill. [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) has refused to bring the bill to the floor, but a discharge petition, championed by [Massie](https://massie.house.gov/) and [Ro Khanna (D-CA17)](https://khanna.house.gov/), is still seeking signatories.

As of last week, the measure was still a handful of GOP members short of its goal. Watch this space.
