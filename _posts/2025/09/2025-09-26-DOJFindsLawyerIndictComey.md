## [DOJ indicts former FBI Director James Comey](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/james-comey-indictment-congress-fbi-director-rcna233691)

*The prosecution marks a serious escalation in the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s politicization of the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/).*

Sept. 25, 2025, 7:12 PM EDT / Updated Sept. 25, 2025, 8:46 PM EDT

By Ken Dilanian and Carol Leonnig

A federal grand jury in [Virginia](https://www.virginia.gov/) on Thursday formally charged former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Director James Comey](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/former-fbi-director-james-comey-facing-imminent-indictment-threat-rcna233539) with lying to [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) and obstruction of a congressional proceeding, days after [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [forced out the U.S. attorney](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-house-lawyer-takes-key-prosecutors-office-scandalous-circumstanc-rcna233233?icid=latestpost_bot) who had opposed bringing the case and publicly urged his attorney general to prosecute it.

The decision by the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) to indict [Comey came over the objections of career prosecutors](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/former-fbi-director-james-comey-facing-imminent-indictment-threat-rcna233539), according to two sources familiar with the case, who assessed that the evidence didn’t support charging [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) with a crime.

> *[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) revived the allegation that [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) misled [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/), despite it having been reviewed and passed over by a [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-appointed special counsel, John Durham.*

Newly installed [U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva) for the [Eastern District of Virginia](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva) announced the grand jury indictment of [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) just before 7 p.m. “The charges as alleged in this case represent a breach of the public trust at an extraordinary level,” her statement read, according to a [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) news release. “The balance of power is a bedrock principal of our democracy, and it relies upon accountability and a forthright presentation of facts from executive leadership to congressional oversight. Any intent to avoid, evade, prevent, or obstruct compliance is a violation of professional responsibility and, most importantly, the law.”

According to the indictment released later, [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) was charged with lying to a senator in a September 2020 hearing when the former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director said he had not “authorized someone else at the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) to be an anonymous source in news reports” regarding an [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) investigation. The obstruction charge is related to making a false statement during that hearing, according to the indictment.

[Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) responded to the indictment by condemning the president for destroying the independence of the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) and urging Americans to have hope for their democracy.

"My family and I have known for years that there are costs to standing up to [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), but we couldn’t imagine ourselves living any other way. We will not live on our knees, and you shouldn’t either," [Comey said a video statement](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPC1sFFD2iF/?l=1). "Somebody that I love dearly recently said that fear is the tool of a tyrant and she’s right. But I’m not afraid and I hope you’re not either. I hope instead you are engaged, you are paying attention, and you will vote like your beloved country depends on it, which it does. My heart is broken for the Department of Justice, but I have great confidence in the federal judicial system and I’m innocent. So let’s have a trial and keep the faith."

[Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey)'s son-in-law, the deputy chief of the national security section in the office where the charges were filed, resigned in protest over [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey)'s indictment.

"To uphold my oath to the Constitution and country, I hereby resign as an Assistant United States Attorney for the [Eastern District of Virginia](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva) in the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) effective immediately," Troy A. Edwards, Jr., wrote in an email to [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva).

The filing of felony charges based on five-year-old testimony before [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/), against a man whom [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has identified as one of his chief political enemies, underscores the extent to which [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has shattered the post-Watergate norm that the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) would operate independently of the [White House](https://www.justice.gov/) on criminal matters. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has not only ended that tradition, but he has bent the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) to his will, firing prosecutors and [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) agents his supporters don’t like, quashing politically inconvenient criminal cases, and pushing for criminal investigations against his adversaries.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) named [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva) as the new interim [U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva) this week after her predecessor, Erik Siebert, another [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) appointee, resigned under pressure for expressing reservations about the justification to bring these charges.

[Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva)’s announcement said [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) faces up to five years in prison if convicted of making false statements and obstruction related to his 2020 congressional testimony regarding the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/)'s investigations during the 2016 election campaign.

The [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) case is a prime example of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s promise to punish political adversaries. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) revived the allegation that [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) misled [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/), despite it having been reviewed and passed over by a [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-appointed special counsel, John Durham, who brought a skeptical eye to the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/)’s investigation of [Russian](http://government.ru/) interference in the [U.S. 2016 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf).

As the revived [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) case seemed to stall last week, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) boasted about forcing out Siebert.

[In a Truth Social post](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115239044548033727) addressed to [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said Siebert “lied to the media and said he quit, and that we had no case. No, I fired him, and there is a GREAT CASE, and many lawyers, and legal pundits, say so.”

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) continued, “We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility. They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) replaced Siebert with [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva), a loyalist who was one of his defense lawyers. She has never served as a prosecutor. Earlier this week, two people familiar with the matter told [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) that prosecutors in the office presented [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva) with a memo arguing that there wasn’t enough evidence to establish probable cause that [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) committed a crime, the sources reported, let alone enough evidence to convince a jury to convict him.

[Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) guidelines say a case should not be brought unless prosecutors believe it’s more likely than not that they can get a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.

[Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva) moved forward with the case nonetheless.

Pam: I have reviewed over 30 statements and posts saying that, essentially, “same old story as last time, all talk, no action. Nothing is being done. What about Comey, Adam “Shifty” Schiff, Leticia??? They’re all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done.” Then we almost put in a Democrat supported U.S. Attorney, in Virginia, with a really bad Republican past. A Woke RINO, who was never going to do his job. That’s why two of the worst Dem Senators PUSHED him so hard. He even lied to the media and said he quit, and that we had no case. No, I fired him, and there is a GREAT CASE, and many lawyers, and legal pundits, say so. Lindsey Halligan is a really good lawyer, and likes you, a lot. We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility. They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!! President DJT
