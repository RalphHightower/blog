## [Anti-Trump protesters in U.K. project images of him with Epstein on Windsor Castle walls](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-protesters-uk-epstein-windsor-castle-rcna231894)

*Four were arrested in connection with the stunt that took place during [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s second state visit to the [United Kingdom](https://www.gov.uk/), which began on Wednesday.*

If [Donald Trump hoped a state visit](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/four-arrested-uk-projecting-photos-trump-epstein-windsor-castle-rcna231804) to the [United Kingdom](https://www.gov.uk/) would provide an escape [from the Epstein files controversy](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-esptein-files-petition-ro-khanna-rcna230592) that’s plagued his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) for months, he was wrong.

Ahead of the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s second state visit, protesters across the pond used the opportunity to [project](https://www.instagram.com/p/DOrdHSUjMZH/?hl=en) expansive photos and videos of the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein [onto the exterior walls of Windsor Castle](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/four-arrested-uk-projecting-photos-trump-epstein-windsor-castle-rcna231804), where [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and the first lady were being hosted by [King Charles](https://www.royal.uk/the-king-0) and [Camilla](https://www.royal.uk/the-queen-0)

Also projected on the world’s largest occupied castle was the salacious [letter Trump allegedly wrote to Epstein](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/epstein-birthday-book-trump-drawing-house-oversight-rcna229846) on his 50th birthday, recently revealed by [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) who subpoenaed documents from Epstein’s estate. The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has denied the authenticity of the letter. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) as said [he had a falling out with Epstein in or around 2004,](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/the-facts-and-timeline-of-trump-and-epsteins-falling-out) and no evidence has linked [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to Epstein’s crimes.

An old photo of the king’s brother [Prince Andrew](https://www.royal.uk/the-duke-of-york), who was friends with Epstein, was also briefly projected against one of the castle turrets. One of Epstein’s victims, the late Virginia Giuffre, sued [Andrew](https://www.royal.uk/the-duke-of-york) in 2021, claiming she was forced to have sex with him, a claim he denied in [a now-famous BBC Newsnight interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKQi3wzNFGQ) in which he said he was at a [PizzaExpress]() in [Woking](https://www.woking.gov.uk/) with his daughter Princess Beatrice at the time of the alleged assault. The case was [settled in 2022](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-60393843) with no admission of wrongdoing.

[Led By Donkeys](https://euobserver.com/the-eus-unsung-heroes/aree7a7c9c), a left-wing political activist group founded in response to Brexit, [claimed responsibility](https://www.instagram.com/p/DOrdHSUjMZH/?hl=en) for the stunt and said that four of its members had been arrested — a first for the group.

"We’ve done, I reckon, 25 or 30 projections since we’ve been going. Often the police come along and we have a chat to them, and they even have a laugh with us and occasionally tell us to not do it,” a spokesperson for [the group told The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/17/four-arrested-after-image-of-trump-and-epstein-projected-onto-windsor-castle-ahead-of-presidents-visit). “But no one’s ever been arrested before, so it is ridiculous that four of our guys have been arrested for malicious communications.”

Other notable [Led By Donkey](shttps://www.ledbydonkeys.org/) stunts include an [incident in January at a Tesla factory in Berlin](https://www.instagram.com/p/DFJDgLao3tO/?hl=en), in which a photo of [Elon Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk/) making a gesture similar to a Nazi salute was projected with the German word “Heil” next to the company’s name.
