## [RFK Jr. targets CDC with a ridiculous complaint as chaos grips the agency](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/rfk-jr-targets-cdc-ridiculous-complaint-chaos-grips-agency-rcna227978)

*As [Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) targets the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/) with nonsense, a growing number of [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) are demanding his resignation.*

Aug. 29, 2025, 9:54 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

Officials at the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/) were still reeling from a recent deadly shooting at its Atlanta headquarters when conditions within the agency deteriorated further. [Team Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [ousted Susan Monarez](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/cdc-susan-monarez-rfk-jr-resignation-rcna227699) as the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/)’s director after less than a month on the job, sparking [a series of resignations](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/cdc-susan-monarez-rfk-jr-resignation-rcna227699) from many of the agency’s most respected leaders.

A day later, as [MSNBC](https://www.hhs.gov/)’s [Brandy Zadrozny reported](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/cdc-employees-walkout-rally-rfk-jr-vaccines-rcna227858), hundreds of employees and [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/) supporters lined the sidewalks outside the agency’s Atlanta headquarters for a “clap out” rally to honor the senior leaders who resigned in protest.

And now [Health](https://www.hhs.gov/) [Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html), who technically oversees the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/) under the umbrella of the [Department of Health and Human Services](https://www.hhs.gov/), is giving the public new reason to question his judgment and competence.

The morning after Monarez’s firing, [RFK Jr.](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) appeared on [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/)s and boasted that [he could diagnose children](https://bsky.app/profile/rpsagainsttrump.bsky.social/post/3lxghkhkhms2v) with “mitochondrial challenges” by walking past them at a distance in airports. ([Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) has no professional background in medicine or science.)

Dr. Kathleen Bachynski, a professor of public health at Muhlenberg College, [described Kennedy’s comments](https://bsky.app/profile/bachynski.bsky.social/post/3lxgiiu6cjc2v) as “absolute gibberish” and slammed the [HHS](https://www.hhs.gov/) secretary as a “dangerous buffoon” who is “threatening us all.” Dr. Ashish Jha, dean at Brown University School of Public Health, [added](https://x.com/ashishkjha/status/1960897339968614834), “This is wacky, flat-earth, voodoo stuff.”

In case that weren’t quite enough, [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) went on to condemn the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/)’s “priorities.” [USA Today reported](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/08/28/rfk-cdc-malaise-vaccine/85865979007/?tbref=hp):

> *[Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html), whose views on vaccines are at odds with the overwhelming majority of doctors, then went on rail against what the agency website lists as the 10 greatest advances in medicine, including vaccines. ‘One of them is abortion. Another is fluoridation and another is vaccines,’ he said. ‘So we need to look at the priorities of the agency. If there’s really a deeply, deeply embedded, I would say, malaise at the agency.’*

Right off the bat, it’s worth emphasizing that vaccines really are one of the greatest advances in medicine in human history, and it’s not all surprising that [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/) would acknowledge this unambiguous fact in a top 10 list.

As for the rest of the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/)’s list on historic advances in medicine, [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) was also factually wrong: The list references family planning, but not “abortion.”

But just as notable is the secretary’s conclusion that it’d be a good idea to publicly slam the agency in the first place, making the broader [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/) crisis worse, not better.

A growing number of [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) senators spent Thursday [calling for Kennedy’s resignation](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-susan-monarez-dc-surge-tariffs-gaza-russia-ukraine-live-updates-rcna226879/rcrd87285?canonicalCard=true) — Georgia’s Jon Ossoff called the anti-science conspiracy theorist a “quack” — and on Friday morning, they were joined by [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.

“[Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) knew [Robert F. Kennedy Jr.](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) would be a disastrous pick to lead health care in America and he nominated him anyway. [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) made this mistake and now he must fire [RFK Jr.](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) immediately,” the [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) said in a written statement. “[RFK Jr.](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html)’s stubborn, pigheaded, and conspiracy-based attacks on proven science are going to make many more people sick and cause more deaths. Americans are in greater danger every day [Robert Kennedy Jr.](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) remains as [HHS](https://www.hhs.gov/) Secretary.

“By keeping [Robert Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) in charge of [HHS](https://www.hhs.gov/), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is doubling down on his own failure. President [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) must admit his mistake and remove Kennedy now.”
