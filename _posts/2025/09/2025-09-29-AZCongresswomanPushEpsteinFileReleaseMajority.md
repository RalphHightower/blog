title: "Arizona Democrat, Adelita Grijalva, Winner In Special Election Will Push Petition Of Epstein Files To Majority"
---


[Adelita Grijalva](https://grijalva.house.gov/) has not been sworn in yet, so she doesn’t have a website yet. I'm guessing at her website. 

## [The brewing fight over Adelita Grijalva’s congressional swearing-in and the Epstein files](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/brewing-fight-adelita-grijalvas-congressional-swearing-epstein-files-rcna234511)


*The [Arizona](https://www.az.gov/) [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) will be the 218th signature on a discharge petition on the Jeffrey Epstein files. Will this lead [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) leaders to delay her swearing-in?*

Sept. 29, 2025, 2:40 PM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

[Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) [Adelita Grijalva](https://grijalva.house.gov/) [cruised to a landslide victory](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/grijalva-arizona-election-republicans-discharge-petition-epstein-rcna233381) last week, winning her congressional special election [by roughly 40 points](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2025-special-elections/arizona-house-results). Once sworn in, she’ll be [Arizona](https://www.az.gov/)’s [first-ever Latina congresswoman](https://rollcall.com/2025/09/23/arizona-special-election-adelita-grijalva-democrat/), succeeding her father, the late [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Raúl Grijalva](https://grijalva.house.gov/), and she’ll narrow the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) majority in the [U.S. House](https://www.house.gov/): [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s will hold 219 seats to the [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)s’ 214, with two vacancies remaining.

What’s more, upon arriving on Capitol Hill, she’s also said she intends to [sign a pending discharge petition](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/grijalva-arizona-election-republicans-discharge-petition-epstein-rcna233381) to force disclosure of the Jeffrey Epstein files, currently being held back by [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/). Proponents of the effort are [currently one member short](https://clerk.house.gov/DischargePetition/2025090209) of 218 signatures, but [Grijalva](https://grijalva.house.gov/)’s support would trigger a process [House Speaker](https://speaker.house.gov/) [Mike Johnson (T-LA4)](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) would be largely powerless to stop.

All the [Arizonan](https://www.az.gov/) has to do is wait for the chamber to return from its current break, at which point she can take the oath of office. With that outcome hanging in the balance, The [The Arizona Republic reported](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2025/09/24/political-fight-brews-around-adelita-grijalva-swearing-in/86333122007/):

> *[Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) [Adelita Grijalva](https://grijalva.house.gov/) has for months been on a glide path to become [Arizona](https://www.az.gov/)’s next member of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/). But now that she’s been elected, as the [U.S. House](https://www.house.gov/) stares down a government funding standoff and a bombshell measure related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a political fight is brewing around when exactly [Grijalva](https://grijalva.house.gov/) will be sworn in.*

At the heart of the matter is a question about how best to deal with routine electoral bureaucracy.

In theory, [Grijalva](https://grijalva.house.gov/) could be sworn in as [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/)’ newest member on Oct. 7, the day members get back to work. This would be consistent with standard practice, including recent developments with [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [James Walkinshaw (D-VA11)](https://walkinshaw.house.gov/), who was declared the unofficial winner of his special election and was sworn in days later.

But there are growing concerns that [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) leaders in the chamber will try to delay [Grijalva](https://grijalva.house.gov/)’s swearing in until officials in [Arizona](https://www.az.gov/) certify the special election results — which, again, were not close — weeks later.

“I think that maybe it has to do with the fact that I am the 218th signer to push for a vote on the release of the Epstein files,” [Grijalva](https://grijalva.house.gov/) [told a local outlet](https://www.kgun9.com/news/local-news/timing-for-grijalvas-swear-in-in-question), referring to a possible delay.

Maybe so.

The [House](https://www.house.gov/) [speaker](https://speaker.house.gov/)’s office hasn’t elaborated on its plans, saying only that the chamber would wait for the “appropriate paperwork.” But as a practical matter, [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) has already received the appropriate paperwork: [Arizona](https://www.az.gov/) [Secretary of State’s Office](https://azsos.gov/) notified the House clerk last week that [Grijalva](https://grijalva.house.gov/) is the unofficial election winner based on the lopsided results.

Under standard practices, that should be plenty. “This documentation has been sufficient to swear in multiple members of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/),” a spokesperson for the [[Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)s on the [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Administration Committee](https://appropriations.house.gov/) told the [Arizona Republic](https://www.azcentral.com/).

Will the [Speaker’s Office](https://speaker.house.gov/) agree? Is there a reason [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) is being coy about this? Watch this space.
