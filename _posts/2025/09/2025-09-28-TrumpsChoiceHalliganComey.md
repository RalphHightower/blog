## [Why Trump tapped Lindsey Halligan to secure the James Comey indictment](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-lindsey-halligan-james-comey-indictment-rcna234122)

*The strategy matches what historian Ruth Ben-Ghiat calls “engineered incompetence.”*

Sept. 28, 2025, 6:00 AM EDT
By [Barbara McQuade](https://michigan.law.umich.edu/faculty-and-scholarship/our-faculty/barbara-l-mcquade), [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) Columnist

On Thursday night, [former FBI Director James Comey was indicted](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/james-comey-indictment-congress-fbi-director-rcna233691) on two charges in the [Eastern District of Virginia](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva7). The fact that a brand-new interim U.S. attorney brought the case just days into her tenure was unusual. Even more unusual was the fact that the prosecutor in question — [a Trump loyalist with no criminal experience — brought the case](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/trump-james-comey-indictment-us-attorney-lindsey-halligan-rcna233853) — brought the case to the grand jury herself despite reports that some prosecutors in her own office worried they [lacked the evidence to convict](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/former-fbi-director-james-comey-facing-imminent-indictment-threat-rcna233539).

The extraordinary saga began when then-interim [U.S. Attorney](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) [Erik S. Siebert was forced out of his job](https://www.msnbc.com/the-weeknight/watch/breaking-u-s-attorney-resigns-after-trump-officials-pushed-him-to-bring-bogus-charges-against-ny-ag-247985733871), [reportedly](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/22/us/politics/trump-lindsey-halligan-james-comey.html) due to his reluctance to push forward with indictments against [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)ial enemies that he did not think would result in charges. Siebert, who had been appointed to the interim position and nominated for the permanent job by [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), announced his resignation on Sept. 19.

In [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s mind, these three public officials were 'guilty as hell' — no trial required. Of what crime, he didn't say.

The next day, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) scolded him in a [social media post addressed to “Pam,”](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-directive-ag-bondi-seen-impeachment-level-scandal-rcna232888) presumably [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/). [The post said](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115239044548033727) that Siebert “lied to the media and said he quit, and that we had no case. No, I fired him.” It was unclear whether [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was referring to a case against [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/), [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) [Attorney General](https://ag.ny.gov/) [Letitia James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james) or [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Adam Schiff (D-CA)](https://www.schiff.senate.gov/), all of whom were named in the post. But it was clear that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) would not tolerate a U.S. attorney who refused to go along with his retribution agenda, calling Siebert “a Woke RINO, who was never going to do his job.”

> *In [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s mind, these three public officials were “guilty as hell” — no trial required. Of what crime, he didn’t say. But revenge was the common thread. “They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING,” he wrote. “JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”*

With Siebert gone. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) needed someone else to do his bidding in the Eastern District. And he had just the woman for the job. As the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) wrote to [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/), “[Lindsey Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) is a really good lawyer, and likes you, a lot.” And soon after, on Sept. 22, [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) was sworn in as interim U.S. attorney, with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) also nominating her for the permanent position.

[Halligan stands in stark contrast](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-house-lawyer-takes-key-prosecutors-office-scandalous-circumstanc-rcna233233) to Siebert. As described in a [Justice Department press release](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/pr/erik-siebert-appointed-interim-us-attorney-eastern-district-virginia) from January, Siebert is an award-winning 15-year veteran of the office with supervisory experience. As a line prosecutor, Siebert has handled the full panoply of federal cases from violent crime to public corruption. He has the kind of record that would typically earn the respect of his peers and develop the judgment to exercise prosecutorial discretion in sensitive cases.

[Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) has a very different record. The former [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/) insurance lawyer has no prosecutorial experience. In 2022, she helped defend [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) against charges of illegally retaining sensitive government documents at his [Mar-a-Lago home](https://www.maralagoclub.com/). Her [few court appearances](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/22/us/politics/lindsey-halligan-trump.html) came mostly in cases defending [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).

In the court of public opinion, however, [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) is more experienced. She has served as a surrogate for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) on [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/), blasting the FBI’s search of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s residence as “an appalling display of abuse of power.” Most recently, the 36-year-old served as a [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) adviser focused on removing content from the [Smithsonian Institution](https://www.si.edu/) that does not reflect [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s preferred version of American history. Her resume does not necessarily suggest someone capable of leading an office that handles some of the nation’s most sensitive national security matters, including cases arising out of the Pentagon or transiting through Dulles International Airport.

But as we have seen throughout [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s second [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/), loyalty often seems to be prized over qualifications. Gone are the generals and experienced administrators of his first [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/). This time around, we have people like Secretary of War](https://www.defense.gov/) Pete Hegseth, who shared information about a military strike on Yemen in a Signal group chat that included a reporter.

This change in personnel seems to be no accident. The strategy matches what historian Ruth Ben-Ghiat calls “[engineered incompetence](https://lucid.substack.com/p/pete-hegseth-and-the-autocratic-strategy).” According to Ben-Ghiat, when individuals are appointed to high office “without the credentials one would normally expect, they become dependent on and indebted to the leader.” The appointee is so grateful for their position that they feel beholden to the leader, and eager to repay his generosity. In exchange, the leader gets an appointee who is easier to control.

Among the most important responsibilities of a U.S. attorney is the discretion to decide whether indictments should be sought in sensitive criminal cases.

> *Among the most important responsibilities of a U.S. attorney is the discretion to decide whether indictments should be sought in sensitive criminal cases. Federal prosecutors take into account factors like public safety, deterrence value, collateral consequences, allocation of resources, the weight of the evidence and the best interests of justice. They may not consider partisan politics in making their decisions.*

Based on the public record, the evidence against [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/) seems thin. And the sparse two-page indictment itself offers little new information.

The [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/)’s Principles of Federal Prosecution prohibit prosecutors from seeking charges unless the evidence is sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction. With his training and experience, Siebert seems to have made the appropriate decision to decline to seek an indictment.

[Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) chose a different path. And her journey is just beginning.

Securing an indictment is only the first step — now she has to mount a case and convince a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/) said in a video statement that he has full faith that the justice system will reaffirm its independence and prove his innocence. If that happens, it might be the only silver lining of this whole mess.
