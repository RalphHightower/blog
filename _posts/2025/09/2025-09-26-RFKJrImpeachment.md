## [As RFK Jr. faces a new impeachment effort, his public support reaches new low](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/rfk-jr-faces-new-impeachment-effort-public-support-reaches-new-low-rcna233987)

*[Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) only had so much political capital. As his support collapses, that capital is now effectively gone.*

Sept. 26, 2025, 3:39 PM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

All things considered, everyone would be better off if [Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) had not joined [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s White House Cabinet, including [RFK Jr.](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) himself.

Eight months into his tenure, the anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist is succeeding in uprooting much of the nation’s public health infrastructure, putting countless Americans’ health at risk. As William Foege, the former director of the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/), [recently summarized](https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/18/rfk-jr-public-health-threats-william-foege-smallpox/), “[Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) would be less hazardous if he decided to do cardiac surgery. Then he would kill people only one at a time rather than his current ability to kill by the thousands.”

But while [RFK Jr.](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html)’s capacity to do real harm to people obviously matters far more than any political considerations, he’s in a political job in a political environment — and he’s burned through his political capital.

Officials who’ve worked closely with [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html), including [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) appointees, have characterized him as [dangerous and incompetent](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/susan-monarez-cdc-director-rfk-jr-rcna232208). The list of people who’ve called on the secretary to resign — a list that includes many members of his own family — is [long](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/09/04/rfk-vaccines-cdc-hearing/#link-DQBWT6SCI5E53HZYAPGNZEWPIQ) and [growing](https://bsky.app/profile/factpostnews.bsky.social/post/3lz2dhhtqmt2t). Even some congressional [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) are [tired of his antics](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/even-republicans-are-growing-weary-rfk-jr-are-willing-act-rcna229321).

As for [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/), [The Hill reported](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5521385-kennedy-health-care-impeachment/):

> *[Rep.](https://www.house.gov%) [Haley Stevens (D-MI11)](https://stevens.house.gov/) announced Thursday she would introduce articles of impeachment against [Health and Human Services](https://www.hhs.gov/) [Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) due to ‘health care chaos’ under his watch. ... [Stevens](https://stevens.house.gov/) has repeatedly called for [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html)’s removal from his role since he became health secretary. She called for [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) to resign earlier this month, citing the slashing of medical research for pediatric cancer and vaccines.*

The [Michigan](https://www.michigan.gov/) [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/), who’s also running for the Senate, is not exactly known as a partisan bomb-thrower. This week, however, [Stevens](https://stevens.house.gov/) said in an online statement, “Health care chaos. Reckless cuts. Rising costs. Michiganders and families across the country are paying the price for [RFK Jr.](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html)’s agenda. Enough is enough, which is why I’m drafting articles of impeachment against [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html).”

A day later, [Stevens](https://stevens.house.gov/) [also introduced](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5522710-michigan-democrat-introduces-stop-rfk-bs-act/) the “Stop RFK’s BS Act,” which would reverse the health care funding cuts that have unfolded since [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) took the reins at the [Department of Health and Human Services](https://www.hhs.gov/).

Given the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) majorities on Capitol Hill, the congresswoman’s efforts aren’t likely to advance, but [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html)’s political troubles aren’t limited to [Washington, D.C.](https://dc.gov/)

The latest national [Quinnipiac University poll](https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3932), for example, found that only 33% of Americans approve of how [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) is handling his job, down from 38% in June. Other recent data [similarly reinforces](https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/19/politics/rfk-polling-vaccines-analysis) the same point: [RFK Jr.](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) is not a popular public figure.

This stands out, not because it’s likely to lead to consequences — the president is already unpopular, and he won’t care whether his health secretary is in the same boat — but because it speaks to [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html)’s stated mission. To hear the [HHS](https://www.hhs.gov/) [chief](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) tell it, his focus is on restoring trust and public confidence in the nation’s health agencies.

The more Americans reject him, the more obvious his failure becomes.
