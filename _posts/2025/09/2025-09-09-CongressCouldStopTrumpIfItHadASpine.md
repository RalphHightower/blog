## [Congress has the tools to challenge Trump’s overreach. It just won’t use them.](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-congress-constitution-dc-power-rcna228823)

*The next few months will determine whether [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s power grabs become permanent.*

Fresh off its summer recess, [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) faces its biggest test in decades.

Unlike big legislative fights of the past, this one could pass by without a notice. But the next few months will determine whether [lawmakers](https://www.congress.gov/) will defend their constitutional powers or surrender them to an increasingly [imperial president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), perhaps for good.

The stakes are no longer theoretical. [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s second term has already demonstrated how fragile checks and balances become when one branch refuses to stand up for itself.

> *[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has made clear that he does not intend to share power.*

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has made clear that he does not intend to share power. In the first few months of his second term, he has rewritten the rules to give himself the power to fire federal workers he deems insufficiently loyal. He’s taken the power of the purse from [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) to decide which agencies and programs he wants to fund. He’s invoked emergency powers to take over the Washington, D.C., police and send armed [National Guard troops](https://www.nationalguard.mil/) to roam its streets.

[Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) could have pushed back against these measures, holding hearings, writing laws or even just warning the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) they might not support his other agenda items. But so far, they have wilted, conceding their power and even defending his right to bully them.

This is not a new problem. Members of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) love to hold hearings, issue subpoenas and launch investigations. But when the executive branch refuses to comply, they too often shrug or even look confused. Contempt citations languish at the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/), which won’t prosecute its own superiors. Court battles drag on for years, long enough to drain their urgency and neuter accountability. The [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/)’s 2020 [Trump v. Mazars](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/supreme-court-rejects-trump-s-argument-key-tax-return-case-n1233312) decision only slowed things further, erecting hurdles for subpoenaing [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)ial records. Delay has become the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s most reliable shield.

[Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) has also surrendered its core powers over [emergencies](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/national-guard-troops-dc-states-rcna225859) and war. When [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)s declare national emergencies, they can redirect funds and expand their authority. In theory, [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) can vote to terminate such emergencies; but in practice, a single [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)ial veto keeps the “emergency” alive indefinitely. That’s how [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s 2019 [border wall maneuver](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/trump-border-emergency-runs-into-wall-of-opposition-in-congress-1448941123810) survived, despite bipartisan votes against it. The same dynamic applies to war powers. A bipartisan measure limiting hostilities against Iran [passed in 2020](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/senate-rejects-war-powers-act-measure-trump-iran-strike-rcna215634), only to be vetoed. [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) folded.

After [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [first term](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/), the [House](https://www.house.gov/) passed the [Protecting Our Democracy Act](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/why-vote-protecting-our-democracy-act-matters-n1285739), designed to accelerate subpoena enforcement, rein in emergency powers, and codify long-overdue guardrails. The Senate let it die. A new version sits idle today. Without reform, [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) remains structurally weak and easily bypassed. It has become irrelevant.

The danger is clear. A [politicized civil service](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-mass-firing-federal-workers-resign-quit-rcna192226), [federalized police](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-takeover-washington-dc-national-guard-police-warning-rcna224603) and an executive branch staffed with loyalists will not be content to sit idle. Something else is coming, and it will be worse.

[Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) doesn’t need new powers. It needs to use the ones it has. It can legislate fast-track procedures for subpoena disputes. It can revive inherent contempt by levying fines without waiting on the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/). It can reform emergency statutes so declarations expire unless [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) votes to extend them. It can attach conditions to spending bills to block funds for Schedule F or unauthorized deployments. It can reclaim war powers by cutting off funds after 30 days of unauthorized hostilities and sunsetting outdated authorizations. And it can require publication of [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) legal opinions that secretly expand executive power, while strengthening its own watchdogs like the [U.S. Government Accountability Office](https://www.gao.gov/) and inspectors general.

Will this [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) act? Almost certainly not. Republican leaders see reform as disloyalty to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). But what is required now is institutional loyalty — the recalibration of power between the branches that puts [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) back on equal footing with the presidency, even when the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) belongs to one’s own party.

The Framers gave [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) formidable weapons: spending, war powers, investigative powers. What they couldn’t give was courage. That must come from lawmakers themselves.

As the 119th [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) reconvenes, the choice is stark. It can continue to play junior partner while [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)ial power grows unchecked. Or it can rediscover its role as a coequal branch of government, capable of saying not just “we object” but “we decide.”

The hour is late. The tools exist. What’s missing is the will.
