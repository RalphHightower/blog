[Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) on the [U.S. House](https://www.house.gov/) [Oversight Committee](https://oversight.house.gov/) announced Monday that it had received a new batch of material related to Jeffrey Epstein requested from his estate — most notably Epstein’s “birthday book,” which contains personal notes to the [disgraced financier on his 50th birthday](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-threatens-wsj-new-epstein-report-picture-claim-looks-sketchy-rcna219545).

A copy of the book submitted to [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) (which was not reviewed by [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/)) included a typed message, [inside the outline of a woman’s torso](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/epstein-trump-wall-street-journal-letter-rcna219501), that read, in part, “A pal is a wonderful thing. Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret.” At the bottom of the message is a signature that appears to be [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has denied writing the note and the drawing and [brought a defamation lawsuit](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/wall-street-journal-trump-epstein-lawsuit-rcna219968) against The [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/) and its parent company, [Dow Jones](https://www.dowjones.com/), for \$10 billion. “This is not me. This is a fake thing. It’s a fake [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/) story,” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said after the initial report. “I never wrote a picture in my life. I don’t draw pictures of women.” The [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/) published an [an article featuring the page in question](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/epstein-birthday-book-congress-9d79ab34) on the same afternoon that the [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) posted their version.

The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) provided the link to [a post on X from press secretary Karoline Leavitt](http://x.com/PressSec/status/1965146390348398627) from press secretary Karoline Leavitt in response to [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/)’s request for comment, saying, “The latest piece published by the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/) PROVES this entire ‘Birthday Card’ story is false. As I have said all along, it’s very clear [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) did not draw this picture, and he did not sign it. [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s legal team will continue to aggressively pursue litigation.”

Separately, [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) Deputy Chief of Staff [Taylor Budowich](https://x.com/TayFromCA/status/1965133529177878754) posted to X, “it’s not his signature. DEFAMATION!” alongside several images of recent examples of the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s signature.

Other redacted documents received by the committee include phone and flight logs, financial records and nondisclosure agreements. It’s not clear if a so-called client list — which the Department of Justice and [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) have said does not exist — is among the documents.

The [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Oversight Committee](https://oversight.house.gov/)’s chair, [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [James Comer (T-KY1)](https://comer.house.gov/), subpoenaed Epstein’s estate for all material related to Epstein in August. The committee said it plans to make the documents it receives public after they’ve been reviewed.

The [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) released [more than 33,000 pages of records related to Epstein](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DRdUVgWe5asZ617_0JJWWZgelvpTVx_i) in August, the vast majority of which was already public.

[Oversight Committee](https://oversight.house.gov/) staff were traveling to [New York City](https://www.nyc.gov/) on Monday to review unredacted versions of the material with Epstein’s lawyers to verify that the redactions were made to protect victims and minors, not powerful individuals.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), who was [told by the attorney general](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/doj-reportedly-told-trump-may-name-epstein-files-rcna220630) that his name appears in some of the documents, has repeatedly dismissed concerns about the files, calling it a “[Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) hoax.”

[House](https://www.house.gov/) [Speaker](https://speaker.house.gov/) [Mike Johnson (T-LA4)](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) spoke in support of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) last week, defending him as “an [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) informant” who helped to expose Epstein, [walk back those comments](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/epstein-case-mike-johnson-backs-claim-trump-was-fbi-informant-rcna229828) those comments on Sunday. “The [Speaker](https://speaker.house.gov/) is reiterating what the victims’ attorney said, which is that [Donald [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) — who kicked Epstein out of [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) — was the only one more than a decade ago willing to help prosecutors expose Epstein for being a disgusting child predator,” read a statement from Johnson’s office.

There are also ongoing efforts in [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) to release the government’s Epstein files. In a rare show of bipartisanship, [Reps.](https://www.house.gov/) [Thomas Massie (T-KY4)](https://massie.house.gov/), and [Ro Khanna (D-CA17)](https://khanna.house.gov/), [endorsed a discharge petition last week](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/release-epstein-files-house-gop-massie-khanna-rcna228850) last week to force a floor vote in the [House](https://www.house.gov/) on legislation to force the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) to release all unclassified Epstein files. (To date, the petition has gotten 215 of the 218 needed signatures.) Survivors of Epstein’s abuse spoke alongside lawmakers at a news conference last Wednesday in [Washington, D.C.](https://dc.gov/), in support of the petition.
