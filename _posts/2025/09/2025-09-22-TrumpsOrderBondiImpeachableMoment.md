## [Why Trump’s directive to AG Bondi should be seen as an impeachment-level scandal](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-directive-ag-bondi-seen-impeachment-level-scandal-rcna232888)

*The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) isn’t just being accused of trying to [weaponize federal law enforcement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-the-weaponization-of-the-federal-government/), he’s now publicly flaunting his corrupt and authoritarian efforts.*

Sept. 22, 2025, 7:59 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

Imagine a scenario in which an investigative reporter uncovered a secret document from the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). The document, in this hypothetical, showed [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) quietly directing his [attorney general](https://www.justice.gov/,) to manufacture criminal cases against his political foes, without regard for evidence or propriety, as part of a brazenly corrupt and overtly authoritarian scheme.

In this scenario, the investigative reporter who obtained this secret document would, in a normal and healthy democracy, have a scoop for the ages. The public exposure of such a document would instantly become the kind of story that would rock the political system, spark heated congressional hearings and generate questions about possible resignations.

But in 2025, there’s apparently no need for an investigative reporter to uncover a clandestine plot — because the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) published his scheme online for all the world to see. [The New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/20/us/politics/trump-justice-department-us-attorneys.html):

> *[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) demanded on Saturday that his [attorney general](https://www.justice.gov/) move quickly to prosecute figures he considers his enemies, the latest blow to the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/)’s tradition of independence. ‘We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility,’ [Mr. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wrote in a social media post addressed to ‘[Pam](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general),’ meaning [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general).*

[The online missive](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115239044548033727) was head-spinning in its absurdity. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) began his message, “I have reviewed over 30 statements and posts saying that, essentially, ‘same old story as last time, all talk, no action. Nothing is being done. What about Comey, Adam ‘Shifty’ Schiff, Leticia??? They’re all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done.’”

In other words, to hear the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) tell it, he saw some “posts” from unnamed people who want some of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s political adversaries to be punished, because they’re “guilty” of unidentified crimes, and these “posts” should necessarily spur action from the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/), because the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) said so.

Concluding that “they” impeached him and tried to hold him accountable for a variety of alleged felonies, the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) concluded that he’s desperate to turn the tables on his enemies. “JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!” he wrote.

In case that was too subtle, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) spoke briefly with reporters soon after, one whom asked whether he was criticizing [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) for not having already gone after his domestic adversaries. “No, I just want people to act,” [the president replied](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-press-gaggle-before-marine-one-departure-september-20-2025/). “They have to act, and we want to act fast. ... We have to act fast.”

[The Times’ report](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/20/us/politics/trump-justice-department-us-attorneys.html) added, “Even for a [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) who has shattered the traditional norms of maintaining distance from the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/), [Mr. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s unabashedly public and explicit orders to [Ms. Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) were an extraordinary breach of prosecutorial protocols that reach back to the days following the [Watergate scandal](https://www.archives.gov/research/investigations/watergate).”

The [Watergate reference](https://www.archives.gov/research/investigations/watergate) is notable in large part because it helps contextualize the gravity of the circumstances: [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) isn’t just being accused of trying to [weaponize federal law enforcement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-the-weaponization-of-the-federal-government/), he’s publicly flaunting his efforts.

His online directive was, for all intents and purposes, a confession in which he freely acknowledged his guilt. “Yes, I admit that I’m pressuring my [attorney general](https://www.justice.gov/) to prosecute my political foes,” the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) effectively declared. “And I’d prefer it if she hurried up and satisfied my hunger for revenge sooner rather than later.”

There’s no precedent in the American tradition for such explicit corruption of the rule of law. It is the stuff of impeachment resolutions. It is a brazen display of a desperate man who believes he’s both above the law and freed from the burdens of accountability.
