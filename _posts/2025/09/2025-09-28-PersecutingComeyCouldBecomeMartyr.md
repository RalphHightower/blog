By [Allison Detzel](https://www.msnbc.com/author/allison-detzel-ncpn1310186)

[MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/)host Joe Scarborough says [Donald Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/donald-trump)’s effort to indict [James Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/) could turn out to be a huge political miscalculation.

On Thursday, a grand jury in the [Eastern District of Virginia](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) [indicted the former FBI director](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/james-comey-indictment-congress-fbi-director-rcna233691) on two counts: making a false statement to [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) and obstruction of a congressional proceeding. The indictment came just days after the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [publicly asked](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-pam-bondi-truth-social-enemies-post-threat-rcna232991) his [attorney general](https://www.justice.gov/), [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general), to prosecute his political enemies, including [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/).

Reacting to the indictment on Friday’s [“Morning Joe,”](https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe) Scarborough said the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/)’s move could backfire on the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/): “You do this, you turn the person you hate into a martyr. You make them bigger than ever.”

He added: “That will be the first line in his obituary — that he was an [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director, but that he became a martyr because a [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) said on social media to an attorney general, ‘Go and arrest this guy.’”

Scarborough also said that by [indicting Comey](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-orchestrates-james-comey-indictment-fbi-justice-corruption-rcna233857), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) could “unite” people behind the former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director.

“Now the world looks at [James Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/), and they see that he’s a political and a legal martyr,” he said. “Nobody thought that way yesterday, but they sure as hell are going to think that way today and tomorrow and into the future.”

Scarborough said [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) should know better, given that during the [2024 presidential campaign](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/watch/-the-final-battle-inside-donald-trump-s-2024-presidential-campaign-of-vengeance-and-martyrdom-196973637917) his [criminal charges](https://www.msnbc.com/katie-phang/watch/justice-delayed-justice-denied-trump-s-criminal-cases-fade-after-election-win-225846853880) helped rally his [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) base.

“Just go back to the 2024 campaign and look how the [Republican Party](https://www.gop.com/) was ready to move on to a certain [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/) [governor](https://www.flgov.com/),” Scarborough said, referring to [Gov.](https://www.flgov.com/eog/) [Ron DeSantis](https://www.flgov.com/eog/leadership/people/ron-desantis). “And then the indictments started coming down against [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), and that brought the [Republican Party](https://www.gop.com/) together behind him, and eventually led him to be elected the next [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) of the United States.”
