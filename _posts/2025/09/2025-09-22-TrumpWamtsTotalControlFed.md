## [After interest rate cut, Trump’s quest to make the Fed bend the knee is far from over](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/federal-reserve-independence-interest-rate-cut-trump-economy-rcna232964)

*The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) now has an inside man at the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/). But it’s clear he wants an even greater influence over the institution.*

Sept. 22, 2025, 3:46 PM EDT
By Ali Velshi

This is an adapted excerpt from the [Sept. 20](https://www.msnbc.com/velshi) episode of “Velshi.”

For the first time since December 2024, the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) decided to [lower interest rates.](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/federal-reserve-interest-rate-decision-trump-rcna231945). It was a modest cut — interest rates will decrease by a quarter of a percentage point — but in announcing its decision last Wednesday, the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) also signaled that it will likely make up to two more cuts before the end of the year.

The move was widely expected, following [recent jobs data](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/august-jobs-report-trump-economy-rcna229388) that indicates the economy may be weaker than previously thought. Hiring has slowed and the unemployment rate has ticked up slightly to 4.3% last month.

But what’s more concerning is that [Stephen Miran](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/miran.htm) isn’t just a voting member of the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) now. It’s that he also remains a member of the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) staff.

The [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) decision was nearly unanimous. Eleven of the 12 [Federal Reserve Board](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/default.ht) members voted in favor of cutting interest rates by a quarter-point.

The lone holdout was [Stephen Miran,](https://www.msnbc.com/11th-hour/watch/miran-cook-controversies-cast-shadow-over-fed-interest-rate-meeting-247735365774) the Fed’s newest member, who advocated for a larger, half-point rate cut. Miran’s elevation to this position is unusual in a few different ways. For one, he’s only been a Fed governor for less than a week. Last month, [Donald Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/donald-trump) nominated him to fill a vacancy on the board after one member resigned before her term was set to expire in January 2026.

The [Senate quickly confirmed Miran](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-confirm-trumps-fed-pick-close-white-house-ties-rcna231642) last Monday by the narrowest of margins, 48 to 47, largely along party lines. He was sworn in the next morning, shortly before the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) was scheduled to begin its two-day meeting to discuss lowering interest rates.

But what’s more concerning is that Miran isn’t just a voting member of the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) now. It’s that he [remains a member of the White House staff,](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-stephen-miran-federal-reserve-senate-hearing-resign-white-house-rcna229099) a member of the executive branch of government, from which the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) is supposed to be independent.

Earlier this year, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) chose him to be the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers. But instead of resigning from that role upon his appointment to the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/), [Miran](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/miran.htm) has chosen to take an unpaid leave of absence, leaving open the possibility of returning to the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).

It’s the first time in the [Federal Reserve’s](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/existence-federal-reserve-jd-vance-says-quiet-part-loud-rcna228081) 90-year history that a member of its board of governors has held a dual role as a member of the [administration](https;//www.whitehouse.gov/administration/).

Many people, including lawmakers, believe that Miran’s appointment is blurring a lot of lines. Last week, [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) in the [Senate](https;//www.senate.gov/) [introduced a bill](https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/senate-democrats-target-mirans-dual-fed-white-house-roles-a588151c?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAgcCZgotwl8YeqwLcuaR729X-8OswMxvhGCg5Up8RApkxJbi0O_vOTBFhFBgz0%3D&gaa_ts=68d17933&gaa_sig=Q7MLWNwpFQZfS9EBUdCL67m_HUt39K3gzZXPyPN1Wq8lohMgh0-SMeAODRS_nHTfL45F_l8b5PuQX3qimIbOvA%3D%3D) that would bar [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) officials from simultaneously holding a [presidentially](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) appointed role. It’s clearly in response to Miran’s appointment and it probably won’t get anywhere in the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)-led [Congress](https;//www.congress.gov/).

But the point is that the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) is supposed to be independent. There are laws in the books, including the aptly named [Federal Reserve Act,](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/fract.htm) that are specifically intended to protect the institution and its members from political meddling.

Despite that, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has spent months attacking [Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell](https://www.msnbc.com/ali-velshi/watch/a-disaster-for-working-americans-trump-s-attacks-on-fed-chair-jerome-powell-risk-tanking-the-dollar-243516485687) as part of a pressure campaign to force the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) to make steeper interest rate cuts and to make them much faster than most of its members seem inclined to do. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) nominated [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) for the job of [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) chair during his first term, but the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is itching to replace him when his term expires next year.

> *The point is that the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) is supposed to be independent.*

[Miran](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/miran.htm)’s lone vote for a half-point cut this week is in line with what [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wants to see. The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) now has an inside man at the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) who could try to influence the outcome of these important economic decisions, which should be nonpolitical and based on data.

And it’s clear [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wants an even greater influence over the institution. He has already attempted to fire Fed governor [Lisa Cook](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-lisa-cook-mortgage-fraud-bill-pulte-rcna232499), who has since filed a lawsuit against the administration over her dismissal. Lower courts have ruled in favor of [Cook](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/cook.htm) so far, which has allowed her to remain on the board for now. But the White House has already asked [the Supreme Court](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/lisa-cook-federal-reserve-supreme-court-trump-rcna232176) to review the case.

On Friday, [Chief Justice John Roberts](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/supreme-court-doesnt-immediately-act-on-trump-bid-to-fire-cook) asked [Cook](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/cook.htm) to respond to the government’s appeal by Thursday, suggesting that the court won’t take any action before then.

Should [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) prevail in firing [Cook](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/cook.htm), it could have wider implications regarding the powers of the presidency. But regardless of the outcome, it’s clear [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s efforts to get the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) to bend the knee won’t stop there.
