## [Legal analyst on new Epstein-Maxwell emails: ‘Expect more of these things to come out’](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/jeffrey-epstein-ghislaine-maxwell-trump-administration-emails-rcna230884)

*Lisa Rubin reacts to a [Bloomberg News](https://www.bloomberg.com/) report that she says raises new questions about the credibility of Epstein co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell.*

Sept. 12, 2025, 3:39 PM EDT
By [Allison Detzel](https://www.msnbc.com/author/allison-detzel-ncpn1310186)

A new report is raising fresh questions about the credibility of [Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-esptein-files-petition-ro-khanna-rcna230592) co-conspirator, [Ghislaine Maxwell.](https://www.msnbc.com/the-beat-with-ari/watch/epstein-s-chilling-secrets-exposed-with-bombshell-personal-email-trove-on-maxwell-trump-others-247418437545). On Thursday, [Bloomberg News](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-jeffrey-epstein-emails-ghislaine-maxwell/) reported that it had obtained more than [18,000 emails](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/epstein-trump-emails-maxwell-bloomberg-report-rcna230711) from Epstein’s personal [Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/) account, including hundreds between Maxwell and the disgraced former financier.

The emails, which have not been independently obtained or verified by [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) or [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/), appear to undermine Maxwell’s repeated attempts to distance herself from Epstein during her two-day interview with [Todd Blanche](https://www.justice.gov/dag/), [Donald Trump’s](https://www.msnbc.com/donald-trump)’s [deputy attorney general](https://www.justice.gov/dag/), [in July.](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/ghislaine-maxwell-todd-blanche-doj-transcripts-audio-rcna226676).

[MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) Legal Correspondent Lisa Rubin joined [“The Weeknight”](https://www.msnbc.com/weeknight) on Thursday to discuss the new report. According to Rubin, concerns over Maxwell’s credibility aren’t new. “If you listen to victims and their lawyers, if you listen to prosecutors, Ghislaine Maxwell’s credibility has long been in doubt,” she pointed out.

However, she said these concerns have a renewed importance in light of [Blanche](https://www.justice.gov/dag/)’s interview and ongoing questions over whether the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) could [grant Maxwell a pardon.](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-ghislaine-maxwell-jeffrey-epstein-pardon-rcna223475).

The [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) legal correspondent added that she was not surprised by the findings of the [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/) report. “We should congratulate our friends at [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/) on that reporting — 18,000 emails is nothing to sneeze at, and I sure would love to get my hands on them and see them — but should we be surprised that Ghislaine Maxwell wasn’t telling [Todd Blanche](https://www.justice.gov/dag/) the complete truth? Absolutely not.”

Rubin said the [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/) News report is also proof that, despite the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)'s best efforts to delay the release of files related to Epstein, information is still likely to make its way into the public record.

“We can expect more of these things to come out — not through a congressional investigation, not through the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/)’s unwillingness to share it with us — but because there are people like Jason Leopold and his team at [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/), and [Julie K. Brown](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/watch/-this-could-really-reek-of-a-cover-up-doj-interviews-ghislaine-maxwell-243857477885) at the Miami Herald, and perhaps even some folks here at [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/), who will uncover more of that truth,” Rubin said.
