## [Trump’s zero-tolerance policy for mortgage fraud doesn’t appear to apply to Republicans](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-mortgage-fraud-bill-pulte-hypocrisy-rcna229315)

*So far, all the people the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has accused of mortgage fraud have one thing in common: they’re all people the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) considers his enemies.*

Sept. 5, 2025, 4:08 PM EDT
By [Jen Psaki](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jen-psaki-ncpn1300286)

This is an adapted excerpt from the Sept. 4 episode of “The Briefing with Jen Psaki.”

[Donald Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/donald-trump) wants you to believe that his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) is tough on crime. And if there is one crime that his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) says it absolutely will not tolerate — one crime that they will go to the ends of the earth to prosecute — it appears to be [mortgage fraud.](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/team-trump-finds-something-new-weaponize-mortgage-fraud-allegations-rcna226381).

According to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s director of the [Federal Housing Finance Authority](https://www.fhfa.gov/), [Bill Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte), this [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) is laser-focused on prosecuting mortgage fraud, no matter who commits it. But here is the thing: so far, all the people [Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte) has accused of mortgage fraud have one thing in common — they’re all people the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) considers his enemies.

> *It seems [Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte) is happy to talk about alleged mortgage fraud by [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/), but he can’t talk about mortgage fraud allegations against [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/).*

In April, [Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte) asked the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) to investigate [New York’s Democratic Attorney General Letitia James](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/donald-trump-letitia-james-subpoenas-rcna224310) for alleged mortgage fraud. In May, [Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte) asked the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) to investigate another [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/), [Sen. Adam Schiff of California](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/doj-opens-investigation-new-york-ags-office-brought-fraud-case-trump-rcna223731), for alleged mortgage fraud.

Earlier this month, he did it again, this time alleging that [Federal Reserve Board governor Lisa Cook](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-lisa-cook-federal-reserve-independence-rcna227526) committed mortgage fraud. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) then used those claims as a pretext to [fire Cook,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA2060f9WVw) and on Thursday, [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/justice-department-lisa-cook-investigation-rcna229061) reported that the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) had officially opened a criminal investigation into [Cook](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/cook.htm).

All of these officials have denied any wrongdoing, and both [Cook](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/cook.htm) and [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james) have said the allegations against them are the result of clerical errors. But [Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte) says that does not matter.

“There are a lot of other people that have been criminally referred, and they don’t have this type of benefit being given to them, which is, ‘Oh, maybe it’s a clerical error, or maybe it’s this.’ Did you sign these documents or did you not?” [Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte) told [CNBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ommFX4dKo6s) on Thursday.

[Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte) definitely wants people to believe he has a zero-tolerance policy for mortgage fraud. But when [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/)’s [Andrew Ross Sorkin]() asked [Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte) in that same interview about credible allegations that [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/)’ pro-[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [attorney general](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/), [Ken Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office), committed this same type of mortgage fraud, he had a much different response.

“Unless it’s been made public by lawyers like Norm Eisen or in criminal referrals, I’m not going to comment on any specific situation,” [Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte) told Sorkin. “If things are made public or if we decide to make them public, then I will talk about it.”

It seems [Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte) is happy to talk about alleged mortgage fraud by [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/), but he can’t talk about mortgage fraud allegations against [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/). Not unless it’s “made public.”

Now, set aside how much that last part seems to contradict everything he said before, the allegations against [Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office) have already been made public.

A simple Google of “[Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office)” and “mortgage fraud” pulls up quite an [array](https://apnews.com/article/paxton-mortgages-trump-primar) [of](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/letters/article/ken-paxton-attorney-general-texas-residences-ag-20786815.php) [articles](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/24/us/politics/ken-paxton-mortgage.html) from a range of national and local outlets that have been reporting on the [attorney general](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/)’s mortgages for months. [Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office)’s [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) primary opponent, [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [John Cornyn](https://www.cornyn.senate.gov/), has even started running [attack ads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PwCf1xsz1I) all about his mortgage problem.

But [Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office) isn’t the only Republican with apparent mortgage issues that [Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte) seems to be ignoring. On Thursday, [ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-cabinet-mortgage-fraud) reported that not one, not two, but three separate [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [Cabinet members](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/) appear to have committed this same type of mortgage fraud.

> *[ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/) reported that not one, not two, but three separate [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [Cabinet members](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/) appear to have committed this same type of mortgage fraud.*

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [labor](https://www.dol.gov/) [secretary](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/osec), [Lori Chavez-DeRemer;](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-labor-secretary-lori-chavez-deremer-rcna181637) his [Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.epa.gov/) [administrator](https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/epa-administrator), [Lee Zeldin;](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/lee-zeldin-epa-carbon-dioxide-greenhouse-gas-climate-change-rcna225024) and his [transportation](https://www.transportation.gov/) [secretary](https://www.transportation.gov/meet-secretary/us-transportation-secretary-sean-duffy), [Sean Duffy](https://www.transportation.gov/meet-secretary/us-transportation-secretary-sean-duffy), all have mortgages on more than one home that they claim as their primary residence. When asked for comment, spokespeople for each of those officials suggested they had done nothing wrong.

A spokesperson for [Zeldin](https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/epa-administrator) said that “EVERY ‘I’ was dotted and ‘t’ was crossed.” A spokesperson for [Chavez-DeRemer](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/osec) said that she and her husband bought a home with the intent to retire there, but then [Chavez-DeRemer](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/osec) decided to run for [Congress](https;//www.congress.gov/) and did not move. And a spokesperson for [Duffy](https://www.transportation.gov/meet-secretary/us-transportation-secretary-sean-duffy) said “The bank, not the Secretary, determined and classified both mortgages as primary residences.”

Maybe that’s true, maybe the bank screwed up the documents. That happens. But according to [Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte), this [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has a zero-tolerance policy, even when it comes to seemingly innocent mistakes.

But let’s be real: Going after mortgage fraud isn’t really [Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte)’s goal at all. His goal is to ingratiate himself with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) by going after the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s enemies — and that double standard is getting more and more obvious by the day.
