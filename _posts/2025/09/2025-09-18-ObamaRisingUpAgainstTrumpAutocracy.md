*With increasing frequency, the former [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is re-entering the political arena in unexpected and unsubtle ways.*

Sept. 18, 2025, 1:06 PM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

When thinking about [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s most prominent and most vocal [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) critics, [Barack Obama](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/-responsible-approach-obama-backs-democratic-response-republican-redis-rcna226263) does not immediately come to mind. That, however, is starting to change.

In April, the former [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [spoke at Hamilton College](https://barackobama.medium.com/conversation-at-hamilton-college-0c44228ac0bd), took aim at [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s trade tariffs, condemned the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s offensive against higher education, expressed his concerns that the values of the United States have “eroded” and said the incumbent [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s efforts to extort law firms were “contrary to the basic compact we have as Americans.”

In June, [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) [spoke at The Connecticut Forum](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/barack-obama-trump-speech-trump-autocracy-rcna213729) in [Hartford](https://www.hartfordct.gov/), warning that the country was “dangerously close” to normalizing behavior “consistent with autocracies.”

A month later, after the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) started falsely accusing him of “treason,” [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/)’s patience wore thin, and he issued a statement about [how “ridiculous”](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/obamas-patience-wears-thin-response-trumps-treason-accusation-ridiculo-rcna220462) [Team Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s claims had become.

In August, [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) [publicly condemned](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2025/08/29/fired-up-ready-to-go-again-00535334) the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/)’s mid-decade gerrymandering schemes — they represent “an existential threat to our democracy,” he said in a video — while having private chats with rising [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) stars such as Zohran Mamdani and touting his party’s recent victories in special elections.

In September, the former Democratic [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) seems even more fired up. [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/) reported:

> *Former [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Barack Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) on Tuesday condemned the assassination of Charlie [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) and the spate of political violence that has gripped the country while rebuking [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his allies’ for politicizing the shooting and not doing more to unite the country.*

At the [Jefferson Educational Society](https://www.jeserie.org/)’s global summit in [Pennsylvania](https://www.pa.gov/), the [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) did not mention [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) by name. He also didn’t have to: [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) drew sharp enough contrasts that were entirely unsubtle.

At the same event, while reflecting on the white supremacist who killed nine Black people at a [church](https://motheremanuel.com/) in [Charleston](https://charleston-sc.gov/), [South Carolina](https://www.sc.gov/), in 2015, [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) added: “As [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) of the United States, my response was not: ‘Who may have influenced this troubled young man to engage in that kind of violence? And now let me go after my political opponents and use that.’”

For good measure, [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) condemned [Charlie Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/)’s slaying as “horrific and a tragedy,” and categorically rejected the very idea of political violence, calling it “anathema to what it means to be a democratic country.” He also made it clear that he found some of the late conservative activist’s ideas abhorrent.

For good measure, the morning after the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) helped force Jimmy Kimmel’s show off the air, [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) turned to [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/), [writing](https://bsky.app/profile/barackobama.bsky.social/post/3lz4jpjnfk222): “After years of complaining about cancel culture, the [current administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has taken it to a new and dangerous level by routinely threatening regulatory action against media companies unless they muzzle or fire reporters and commentators it doesn’t like.”

Pointing to [an article](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/15/business/media/washington-post-charlie-kirk-karen-attiah.html) about [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) firing columnist Karen Attiah for [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/)-related comments, the former [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [added](https://bsky.app/profile/barackobama.bsky.social/post/3lz4jpl4nb222): “This is precisely the kind of government coercion that the [First Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/) was designed to prevent — and media companies need to start standing up rather than capitulating to it.”

Just two days before the end of his presidency, [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) [hosted a [White House press conference](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/18/remarks-president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)-final-press-conference) in which he said he expected the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) administration and congressional Republicans to make their own determinations about the nation’s direction — and, by and large, he intended to stay out of it.

[Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) acknowledged at the time, however, that there might be exceptions to the rule. “There’s a difference,” the outgoing [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) explained, “between that normal functioning of politics and certain issues or certain moments where I think our core values may be at stake.”

Nearly nine years later, I can’t help but get the feeling that [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) sees our core values in jeopardy with increasing frequency.
