title: "Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent's Billionaire Buddy Bailout For Rob Citrone’svBad Bet on Argentina"

My call script to:

| Representative/Senators | Telephone |
|---|---|
| [Joe Wilson (T-SC2)](https://joewilson.house.gov/) | [\+1 (803) 939-0041](tel:+18039390041) |
| [Graham, Lindsey (T-SC)](https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/) | [\+1 (202) 224-5972](tel:+12022245972) |
| [Scott, Tim (T-SC)](https://www.scott.senate.gov/) | [\+1 (202) 224-6121](tel:+12022246121) |

I have one question. Why the hell are why are we loaning Argentina \$20 billion in a debt swap deal? Oh, I get it, one of Treasury Secretary Bessent’s billionaire buddies, Rob Citrone, a hedge fund manager has bet big in Argentina. If Argentina fails, his portfolio takes a huge hit; if it succeeds, his portfolio spikes significantly in value. The past failures of loans to Argentina point to a dismal chance of success. Argentina's central bank is quasi independent being influenced by government policies. 

This \$20 billion is a bailout for Scott’s buddy and Argentina’s president, Javier Milei, ahead of their election. If this boondoggle succeeds, America demands a percentage clawback of Rob Citrone’s financial gains. My outrage at this billionaire buddy bailout is on a scale of Spinal Tap’s “11.”

*[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and the MAGA movement have framed [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/) as a shining success. But throwing American tax dollars at its economy tells a different story.*

Sept. 29, 2025, 3:22 PM EDT
By [Ja'han Jones](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jahan-jones-ncpn371241)

[Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) are preparing to hurl billions of dollars at [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/) to prevent its MAGA-inspired [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) from going up in flames.
[Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/) [Secretary Scott Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent)’s [announcement last week](https://x.com/SecScottBessent/status/1970821535507026177) that the U.S. is in talks to provide more than \$20 billion in a currency swap, along with other forms of aid, to prop up the South American country’s economy — and thereby aid [President Javier Milei](https://www.casarosada.gob.ar/el-presidente/)’s flailing [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) — is a clear sign that the political outlook for [Milei](https://www.casarosada.gob.ar/el-presidente/) [has soured in recent months](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/26/world/americas/milei-argentina-economy.html).


[For years now](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/20/trump-bolsonaro-javier-milei-argentina-far-right), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and the MAGA movement have portrayed [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/)’s right-wing leader and his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) [as a shining example of what deep cuts to federal programs](https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/cpac-nayib-bukele-javier-milei-rcna140030) — mostly, targeting the poor and the middle class — can do. But [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/)’s economy has continued to suffer under [Milei](https://www.casarosada.gob.ar/el-presidente/)’s policies, undermining [Trump’s rosy portrayal](https://english.elpais.com/international/2024-11-13/trump-tells-milei-you-are-my-favorite-president-in-first-call-since-us-election.html).

A report from [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/) last week, headlined [“Argentina Is Losing Faith in Milei’s Free-Market Revolution,”](https://www.wsj.com/world/americas/argentina-is-losing-faith-in-mileis-free-market-revolution-9475ba42?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAj9CuXXeE3Z_R6AScNxzVAUqtIQrPlGCkJsF0dsCBPYQyERY5UB3rCTwv2yEeQ%3D&gaa_ts=68dac0fd&gaa_sig=pLjsQpT53Mm5-1uiIpY5sJ9hYZpgnQbipA-Ys7L0vMfKntw46D_01tQt5Vtz39lHG6i-s6nYBikkuDWBulOu9A%3D%3D) detailed the growing public discontent with [Milei](https://www.casarosada.gob.ar/el-presidente/). And the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) may see that as a bad omen for its own political prospects, given how closely its policies have mirrored [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/)’s.

Even as [Milei](https://www.casarosada.gob.ar/el-presidente/)’s rule has coincided with increased poverty in his country, he has been [granted a level of idolatry](https://english.elpais.com/international/2024-11-13/trump-tells-milei-you-are-my-favorite-president-in-first-call-since-us-election.html) in the [MAGA movement](https://www.foxbusiness.com/fox-news-world/hailed-trump-musk-argentinas-milei-economic-miracle-maker). Conservative entrepreneur [Vivek Ramaswamy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivekgramaswamy/), who’s running for [governor](https://governor.ohio.gov/) of [Ohio](https://governor.ohio.gov/), [has said](https://x.com/VivekGRamaswamy/status/1858559544202502250) the U.S. government is in need of “[Milei](https://www.casarosada.gob.ar/el-presidente/)-style cuts, on steroids.” And [Elon Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk), who steered [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s gutting of the federal government, has [looked to Argentina as a model](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musks-doge-looks-to-argentinas-economic-reform-cut-spending-2024-11) and even [wielded a chain saw with Milei](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkMVb0RNptA) at this year’s [Conservative Political Action Conference](https://www.cpac.org/), to symbolize his own plans to slash the federal government.

As [The Washington Post reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/09/28/argentina-us-bailout-package/) reported Sunday, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s plans to bail out [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/) — while the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) wages its own destructive economic agenda equipped with crippling tariffs and deep austerity measures — has even angered many of the president’s supporters.

Indeed, it seems clearly antithetical for a purportedly “America First” [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) to extend a \$20 billion lifeline to a foreign country while it cuts essential programs that millions of Americans rely on — a politicized gutting of the federal government said to have been made in the name of efficiency [despite evidence to the contrary](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/doge-federal-employees-reductions-in-force-rif-rcna222536).

But the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) sees [Milei](https://www.casarosada.gob.ar/el-presidente/)’s [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/) as an international example of MAGA success. And there’s no telling how much taxpayer money it is willing to spend to make that façade seem real.
