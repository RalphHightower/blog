[Jen](https://www.msnbc.com/jen-psaki)'s Version: [Jen Psaki](https://www.msnbc.com/jen-psaki) addresses questions asked at the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) press briefing, including what [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) meant by "if a man has a little fight with the wife they say this is crime," as he complained about the crime getting in the way of his claim that [Washington D.C.](https://dc.gov/) doesn't have any more crime.
