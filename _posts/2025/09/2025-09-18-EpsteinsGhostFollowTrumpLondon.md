## [Trump's U.K. visit may be haunted by Epstein questions](https://www.msnbc.com/news/news-analysis/trump-uk-prime-minister-starmer-epstein-project-47-rcna231357)

*The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) hoped for pageantry. Instead, he'll likely face more scrutiny.*

Sept. 16, 2025, 2:10 PM EDT
By Akayla Gardner

The shadow of Jeffrey Epstein looms over [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s high-stakes trip to the [United Kingdom](https://www.gov.uk/), as ties to the late convicted sex offender continue to damage political and business leaders around the world.

Ahead of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s visit, [British Prime Minister Keir Starmer](https://www.gov.uk/government/people/keir-starmer) fired his ambassador to the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) over leaked email exchanges with Epstein, renewing questions about the financier’s alleged links to other powerful British people.

In recent weeks, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) sued the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/) after it published an article saying he sent Epstein a letter that included a drawing of a naked woman. [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) later [released](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/epstein-birthday-book-trump-drawing-house-oversight-rcna229846) a copy of the drawing, which [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) maintains is fake.

The news all but ensured that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) will again be confronted with questions about Epstein during his [U.K.](https://www.gov.uk/) visit. Reminders of Epstein will be both literal and figurative for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) in [London](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOoHHieCORP/?igsh=cTQxbjk0aW03bWR0), after a protest group known as “Everyone Hates Elon” raised [thousands of pounds](https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/p/trump-uk-visit-epstein) to plaster the city with one of the most well-known images of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and Epstein.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) had hoped for a more stately welcome featuring royal pageantry, as he got during a visit as [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) in 2019.

“He enjoyed the ceremony of it, the pomp and circumstance, and the regalia,” recalled Michael Martins, a former official who served during [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s first state visit. “There will be even more of an emphasis on that, because of what’s going on in both sides’ domestic politics.”

Both he and [Starmer](https://www.gov.uk/government/people/keir-starmer) appeared to hope the visit would help distract from more nettlesome political troubles, such as the questions about Epstein. The subject, however, will almost certainly arise during a press conference scheduled for Thursday. During a trip to his properties in [Scotland](https://www.gov.scot/) in late July, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was similarly hit by questions about the reason for their fallout, which he blamed on Epstein recruiting young women who worked at his [Florida resort spa](https://www.maralagoclub.com/).

[Starmer](https://www.gov.uk/government/people/keir-starmer) is also in a difficult spot. He had initially defended Ambassador Peter Mandelson before ousting him amid scrutiny from his own [Labor Party](https://labour.org.uk/). (Mandelson did not immediately respond to a request for comment from [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/).) [Starmer](https://www.gov.uk/government/people/keir-starmer) is preparing to appoint a new deputy leader and set an agenda for next year, but his standing in the polls has declined while his conservative rivals are gaining momentum.

Thousands marched in a far-right “Unite the Kingdom” rally in [London](https://www.london.gov.uk/home-page) in recent days, protesting immigration into Britain and leading to injuries of some two dozen police officers. [Nigel Farage](https://nfarage.com/), who leads [Britain](https://www.gov.uk/)’s[ Reform U.K. party](https://reformparty.org/) and a longtime ally of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), currently holds an edge over [Starmer](https://www.gov.uk/government/people/keir-starmer) in polls.

That puts the [prime minister](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/prime-ministers-office-10-downing-street) in a diminished position to press [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to support two key positions of his government against the wars in Gaza and [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/). [Starmer](https://www.gov.uk/government/people/keir-starmer) has signaled the possibility of recognizing Palestinian statehood as soon as this month, a prospect that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has previously rejected over concerns it would legitimize Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group.

[Starmer](https://www.gov.uk/government/people/keir-starmer) has also led a push by [European leaders](https://european-union.europa.eu/) to convince the U.S. to back security guarantees for [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/) as it defends itself against [Russia](https://government.ru/)’s invasion. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has suggested he would support assurances for [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/)’s long-term stability, but he’s been adamant that he wants [Europe](https://european-union.europa.eu/i) to bear the brunt of the costs associated with military assistance. Additionally, the [prime minister](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/prime-ministers-office-10-downing-street) is under pressure to land more favorable terms on trade after [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) imposed sweeping tariffs on dozens of countries, including on the key [British](https://www.gov.uk/) exports of steel and aluminum.

“He’s having to walk this delicate tightrope where on the international stage, the U.S. and the [U.K.](https://www.gov.uk/) have such a strong and deep partnership” and “he wants American support,” Martins said, but “if he’s seen as too close to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), that could expose him to some backlash there, that he’s going to have to live with politically.”
