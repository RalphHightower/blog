title: "Trump’s Pick yo Lead Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), E.J. Antoni, Is Like Karoline Leavitt Reading Trump’s Weight Instead of a Nurse. He's Also a J6'er"
---

Data is data. It doesn't belong to a political party. [Donnie](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) hates negative news. After a negative jobs report, he fired the Commissioner of the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/). He wants to "cook the books" to make him look good. But that will be detrimental to businesses, Wall Street and Main Street. Should they expand? Where should they expand?

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) knows how to "cook the books". Well, maybe he's not that good since a [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) convicted him of 34 counts of business records falsification.

## [With new accusations, Trump’s labor statistics nominee E.J. Antoni goes from bad to worse](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/ej-antoni-labor-statistics-trump-nominee-bls-rcna229399)

*[E.J. Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd)’s nomination was already dreadful. New reporting about his alleged social media habits makes it vastly worse.*

Sept. 5, 2025, 3:12 PM EDT / Updated Sept. 5, 2025, 4:50 PM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

A couple of weeks after [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) responded to [his ugly record on jobs](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/us-job-growth-turns-ugly-summer-trumps-economic-agenda-falters-rcna229286) by [firing the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-responds-failure-create-jobs-firing-us-labor-statistics-chief-rcna222532), the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [introduced his own nominee](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jan-6-revelations-trumps-labor-statistics-nominee-create-new-test-gop-rcna224959): [E.J. Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd), the chief economist at the [Heritage Foundation](https://www.heritage.org/). Almost immediately, [Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd) was exposed as an almost cartoonishly poor choice.

His [academic background](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/ej-antoni-who-bls-44f73217?mod=hp_lead_pos1), for example, leaves little doubt that he’s spectacularly unqualified to lead the bureau. But there’s no need to stop there: [Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd) also has a record of [misunderstanding the very government data](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/12/business/trump-bls-ej-antoni.html) he’s supposed to oversee; he’s signaled an interest in [moving away from](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/cooking-books-hiding-books-team-trump-puts-access-jobs-data-doubt-rcna224693) releasing monthly job reports; he’s [derided Social Security](https://www.mediamatters.org/social-security/trumps-bls-commissioner-nominee-ej-antoni-calls-social-security-ponzi-scheme) as a “Ponzi scheme”; and he helped craft the right-wing [Project 2025 blueprint](https://bsky.app/profile/thebulwark.com/post/3lwen55jkbk25).

There’s a reason [Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd) has been [mocked](https://x.com/GaryWinslett/status/1955074525546053778) by his contemporaries as “a joke.”

Just when it seemed [Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd)’s record couldn’t get much worse, [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/trump-bureau-labor-statistics-nominee-ej-antoni-jan-6-bystander-rcna224645) that the [BLS](https://www.bls.gov/) nominee was [also among the crowd outside the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jan-6-revelations-trumps-labor-statistics-nominee-create-new-test-gop-rcna224959).

It’s against this backdrop that [CNN reported](https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/05/politics/kfile-ej-antoni-bureau-of-labor-statistics-twitter-account-vis):

> *[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s nominee to lead the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/) operated a since-deleted [Twitter](https://x.com/) account that featured sexually degrading attacks on Kamala Harris, derogatory remarks about gay people, conspiracy theories, and crude insults aimed at critics of [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). ... [Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd)] posted the comments from approximately 2017 through 2020 under a series of usernames and display names. [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/) verified that all of [Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd)’s posts came from the same [Twitter](https://x.com/) account and that the posts from the anonymous aliases shared strikingly similar biographical details as [Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd).*

While the reporting hasn’t been independently verified by [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com) or [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/), [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/)’s report does dovetail with [a recent report](https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-ej-antoni-trump-bls-conspiracy-theories-epstein-covid-election-denial/) from [Wired](https://www.wired.com/) magazine that highlighted, among other things, apparent [Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd) posts referencing conspiracy theories related to Covid and the 2020 election, and references to weapons used by Nazi Germany in World War II.

The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has made no effort to push back against the reporting, instead claiming that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s nominee “has the experience and credentials needed to restore solution-oriented leadership at the [BLS](https://www.bls.gov/).”

Given everything we know about [Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd), there’s little reason to believe that’s true.

The broader question is whether [Senate] [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) will care. His nomination will have to advance through the [Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) committee](http://www.help.senate.gov/) — a panel that includes [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [Sens.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Susan Collins (T-ME)](https://www.collins.senate.gov/) and [Lisa Murkowski (T-AK)](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/) — and it’s a safe bet they’ll take note of an online item in which [Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd) appears to have written, after [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) John McCain’s death, “I like a senator who doesn’t die.”

Unless the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has reason to believe [Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd)’s nomination is doomed and not worth fighting for, he will receive a confirmation hearing, which has not yet been scheduled. Watch this space.

Update (September 5, 2025, 4:49 p.m. ET): Responding to the latest reporting, [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Patty Murray (D-WA)](https://www.murray.senate.gov/), a senior member and former chair of the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/,) [Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee](https://www.help.senate.gov/), said in a written statement, “[E.J. Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd) is seriously unwell — he is apparently a disturbed, hateful, conspiracy-driven man who does not belong in government. Not only is he an unqualified, partisan hack but apparently he has been a prolific promoter of vile, hate-filled screeds against women, sexual abuse survivors, and anyone who disagrees with [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). [E.J. Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd) should withdraw his nomination immediately, and this kind of revolting behavior should be a red line for all [Senators](https://www.senate.gov/).

“Every [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [Senator](https://www.senate.gov/) should be asked about these comments and whether they trust [Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd)’s judgment. Any [Senator](https://www.senate.gov/) who considers voting to confirm him should understand: a vote for [Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd) is not only a vote against America’s economic stability and the credibility of our jobs data, but the implicit endorsement of hateful, disgusting, and backward ideas that belong in the garbage heap of history.”

The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) is tapping MAGA loyalist [E.J. Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd) for the top job at the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/). [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/)’s Jason Johnson reports and is joined by [Justin Wolfers](https://lsa.umich.edu/econ/people/faculty/jwolfers.html), an [economist](https://lsa.umich.edu/econ/) at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/).
