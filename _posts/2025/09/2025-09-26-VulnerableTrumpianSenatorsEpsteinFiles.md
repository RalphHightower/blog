## [As the House inches toward vote on Epstein files, spotlight shifts to vulnerable GOP senators](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/jeffrey-epstein-files-discharge-petition-next-steps-senate-rcna233978)

*Some [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) will need to ask themselves a very important question: Will they spend all their political capital keeping the Epstein files secret?*

Sept. 26, 2025, 4:55 PM EDT
By [Claire McCaskill](https://www.nbcnews.com/author/claire-mccaskill-ncpn967501)

This is an adapted excerpt from the [Sept. 25](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house) episode of “Deadline: White House.”

After [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) [Adelita Grijalva](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/grijalva-arizona-election-republicans-discharge-petition-epstein-rcna233381) secured a win Tuesday in a special election in [Arizona](https://www.az.gov/), the [House](https://www.house.gov/) appears to be one step closer to forcing a vote on bipartisan legislation that would require the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) to release its files associated with the investigation into [Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-epstein-statue-removed-national-mall-rcna233501).

For weeks, the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) and its allies on Capitol Hill, such as [House Speaker Mike Johnson (T-LA4)](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/epstein-case-mike-johnson-backs-claim-trump-was-fbi-informant-rcna229828), have been trying to squash [the effort to force a vote](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-esptein-files-petition-ro-khanna-rcna230592) led by  [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Thomas Massie (T-KY4](https://massie.house.gov/). But if their attempts to stop this petition were going to succeed, they would have already succeeded by now.

These members of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/), both [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) and [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/), have put their flag in the ground. They will keep their names on that petition. In the end, I believe they will succeed and force that vote in the [House](https://www.house.gov/) — and I also believe there will be more [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) who join them.

Behind the scenes, [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) does his very best to do what [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wants. That’s what he always does. But this is one situation that he can’t control. This issue is bigger than Johnson — and, frankly, it’s going to prove to be bigger than [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).

If this vote passes the [House](https://www.house.gov/), then it all comes down to the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/). That’s where it gets really interesting. We now have some senators who are facing real opposition next year. In [Ohio](https://www.ohio.gov/), [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Jon Husted](https://www.husted.senate.gov/) — who took [Vice President JD Vance’s](https://www.msnbc.com/jd-vance) — is running against former [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [Sen. Sherrod Brown](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/sherrod-brown-ohio-senate-2026-rcna224902).

You’ve also got [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [Sen. Susan Collins](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/shame-republican-sen-susan-collins-faces-heckling-boos-public-event-ma-rcna227723) in [Maine](https://www.maine.gov/) and [Sen. John Cornyn](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/thursdays-campaign-52925-texas-poll-offers-discouraging-news-john-corn-rcna209751) in [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/), who will likely both be facing some tough opposition heading into next year. Even [Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/mondays-campaign-9825-virginia-race-likely-shrink-gops-edge-house-rcna229849), a [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) from [Mississippi](https://www.ms.gov/), could end up with a serious [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) opponent.

They will all need to ask themselves a very important question in the coming weeks: Will they spend all their political capital to keep the Epstein files secret?

This is not going to be a political winner for the [Republican Party](https://www.gop.com/). And, believe me, those members of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) know it — and they know it a lot better than [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) does.

[Claire McCaskill](https://www.nbcnews.com/author/claire-mccaskill-ncpn967501), a [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/), was the first woman elected to the U.S. [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) from [Missouri](https://www.mo.gov/). She is currently an [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) and [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/) political analyst.
