## [Brazil’s Bolsonaro, the ‘Trump of the Tropics,’ is found guilty of coup charges](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/brazils-bolsonaro-trump-tropics-found-guilty-coup-charges-rcna230688)

*As [Brazil](https://www.gov.br/)’s Jair Bolsonaro is convicted by a [Supreme Court](https://www.gov.br/orgaos/supremo-tribunal-federal) majority of plotting a coup, the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s reaction will make a big difference.*

Sept. 11, 2025, 4:20 PM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

A few years ago, [Brazil](https://www.gov.br/)’s then-President [Jair Bolsonaro](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-bolsonaro-radical-tariff-gambit-brazil-goes-bad-worse-rcna222329) narrowly lost his bid for a second term. In circumstances that might sound familiar to American audiences, the far-right leader responded to the defeat by, according to prosecutors, [plotting what was effectively a coup](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-bolsonaro-trial-brazil-military-might-rcna230388) that would’ve allowed him to remain in office.

Bolsonaro now wants to return to power in [South America’s largest country](https://www.gov.br/), but a rather important hurdle was standing in the way: criminal charges for allegedly trying to [overturn the results](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/brazil-bolsonaro-charged-alleged-coup-plan-poison-lula-rcna192749) of his 2022 loss.

The process isn’t going especially well for the man who has embraced the “Trump of the Tropics” label. [Reuters reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/brazil/brazils-bolsonaro-guilty-coup-charges-court-majority-decides-landmark-rcna230678):

> *Former [Brazilian](https://www.gov.br/) president Jair Bolsonaro was convicted by a [Supreme Court](https://www.gov.br/orgaos/supremo-tribunal-federal) majority on Thursday of plotting a coup to remain in power after losing the 2022 election, a powerful blow to the populist far-right movement he created. The presumptive ruling by a majority of a panel of five justices in [Brazil](https://www.gov.br/)‘s [Supreme Court](https://www.gov.br/orgaos/supremo-tribunal-federal) makes Bolsonaro the first former president in the country’s history to be convicted for attacking democracy.*

While the majority on the [Brazilian](https://www.gov.br/) bench found Bolsonaro guilty, the ruling was not unanimous, and one of the justices said the former president should be acquitted on all charges.

I won’t pretend to have any expertise in the country’s legal process, but [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/)’ report added: “That single vote could open a path to challenges to the ruling, potentially bringing the trial’s conclusion closer to the run-up of the 2026 presidential elections, in which Bolsonaro has repeatedly said he is a candidate despite being barred from running for office.”

In the meantime, it will also be of interest to see how the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) responds to the developments. Indeed, in keeping with his usual pattern, [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has rallied behind his controversial ally, dismissing the criminal allegations as a [“witch hunt”](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/5-major-problems-trumps-radical-tariff-gambit-brazil-bolsonaro-trial-rcna218070) and demanding that the charges against the former president be dropped.

But that’s not all the [American president](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) did. In July, the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) also [announced steep new trade tariffs](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-bolsonaro-radical-tariff-gambit-brazil-goes-bad-worse-rcna222329) on [Brazil](https://www.gov.br/), in part because the [Brazilian](https://www.gov.br/) prosecutors brought a case that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) didn’t like.

The tariffs against [Brazil](https://www.gov.br/) were [the highest](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/30/world/americas/trump-sanctions-brazil-judge-bolsonaro.html) of any levy [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has imposed this year. The move came on the heels of [Secretary of](https://www.state.gov/biographies/marco-rubio/) [State](https://www.state.gov/) [Marco Rubio](https://www.state.gov/biographies/marco-rubio/) announcing steps to [revoke the visa](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/07/18/us/trump-news/a42e8ca1-3076-53d1-9b8f-03377103845a?smid=url-share) of a [Brazilian](https://www.gov.br/) judge who imposed restrictions on Bolsonaro as his case unfolded. The [Treasury Department](https://home.treasury.gov/) soon followed by [sanctioning the judge](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-bove-hegseth-epstein-maxwell-giuffre-immigration-live-updates-rcna221293/rcrd85679?canonicalCard=true).

There’s no precedent in the American tradition of a U.S. [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) trying to leverage trade policy to derail a criminal case in a sovereign nation, but the [president and his team](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) did it anyway.

Now that Bolsonaro has been convicted, it’s likely that the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s response will become even more radical. Watch this space.
