## [The Trump Justice Department has lost the benefit of the doubt with (some) judges](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-justice-department-lost-benefit-doubt-judges-rcna228763)

*A new ruling on the [Alien Enemies Act](https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/alien-and-sedition-acts) provides a snapshot of the “presumption of regularity” that previous [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)s have enjoyed.*

Sept. 3, 2025, 12:40 PM EDT
By [Jordan Rubin](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jordan-rubin-ncpn1301611)

The [“presumption of regularity”](https://harvardlawreview.org/print/vol-131/the-presumption-of-regularity-in-judicial-review-of-the-executive-branch/) is a boring-sounding but important phrase in the law. It signals the deference that courts have historically given the government. One of the [Trump Justice Department](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/abrego-garcia-returned-contempt-sanctions-trump-admin-still-table-rcna211782)’s latest legal losses highlights how his [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) has lost that good faith from the judiciary — or some of the judiciary, anyway.

The latest defeat came [late Tuesday](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca5.224134/gov.uscourts.ca5.224134.507678079.1.pdf) from a divided panel of judges on the [U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit](https://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/). The topic was the [Alien Enemies Act](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-alien-enemies-act-memo-deportations-rcna205112), the 18th-century law that [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) invoked to deport [alleged Venezuelan gang members](https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-immigration/the-makeup-artist-donald-trump-deported-under-the-alien-enemies-act). The panel majority granted [preliminary injunction](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca5.224134/gov.uscourts.ca5.224134.196.0.pdf) against the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s use of the law for deportations in Northern [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/).

The ruling is significant in its own right because it undercuts one of the key legal claims pressed by the government in [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s second term (a declassified government memo [previously undercut](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/us/trump-venezuela-gang-ties-spy-memo.html) the factual basis for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s invocation as well).

But disagreement between the majority and the dissent also spotlights a broader issue over whether the courts trust [this DOJ](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/04/us/politics/trump-justice-department-judges-courts.html), whose representations [judges have questioned](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/04/us/politics/trump-justice-department-judges-courts.html) in [multiple cases](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/judge-abrego-garcia-discovery-doj-trump-rcna202351) related to the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s [aggressive deportation agenda](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/judge-boasberg-trump-criminal-contempt-deportation-rcna200064).

In granting the injunction Tuesday, the [5th Circuit](https://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/) majority had to analyze the likelihood that the plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm without preliminary legal relief. Siding with the plaintiffs, the majority cited (among other things) previous litigation at the [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) where the justices sided with plaintiffs despite the government’s assurances. The two judges in the majority on the [5th Circuit](https://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/) panel were [George W. Bush](https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/) appointee [Leslie Southwick](https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/southwick-leslie) and [Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) appointee [Irma Ramirez](https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/ramirez-irma-carrillo).

In a lengthy dissent, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) appointee [Andrew Oldham](https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/oldham-andrew-stephen) was bothered by (among other things) the majority refusing to give greater deference to the government. More dramatically, [Oldham](https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/oldham-andrew-stephen) accused the majority of suggesting that [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) lawyers are lying. “If they are, I suppose they should be sanctioned. But it is astounding to say that lawyers from the United States [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) are lying,” wrote the judge, [who’s a contender](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/three-potential-scotus-picks-top-the-ranks-in-a-trump-alignment-index) for any [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) vacancy that emerges under [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).

“The majority’s disbelief of [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) also conflicts with the presumption of regularity,” [Oldham](https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/oldham-andrew-stephen) went on, writing that courts “employ a heavy presumption that Government officers, including Government lawyers, act in good faith ‘in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary.’” He found it “troubling that, here again, the rules for this [Administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) are different.” If anything, he concluded, “the majority seems to give this [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) a presumption of irregularity.”

[Oldham](https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/oldham-andrew-stephen)’s complaint calls to mind [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) Justice [Ketanji Brown Jackson](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-ketanji-brown-jackson-dissent-deadline-newsletter-rcna214180)’s recent complaint that her colleagues invariably find a way to side with the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/), [lamenting that](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/ketanji-brown-jackson-supreme-court-trump-calvinball-rcna226523) the high court is [playing a version of “Calvinball” in which “this Administration always wins.”]({% link _posts/2025/08/2025-08-23-JusticeJacksonReferencesCalvinball.md %})

If this latest [Alien Enemies Act](https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/alien-and-sedition-acts) litigation makes it to the justices, it can provide the latest test of whether [Oldham](https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/oldham-andrew-stephen)’s or Jackson’s views are vindicated.
