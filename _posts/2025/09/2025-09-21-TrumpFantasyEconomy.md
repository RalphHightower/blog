## [As the public rejects his economic performance, Trump pitches an alternate reality](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/public-rejects-economic-performance-trump-pitches-alternate-reality-rcna232414)

*As Americans’ attitudes on the economy sour, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has some choices. He’s settled on the worst one: He’s making stuff up.*

Sept. 19, 2025, 11:34 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

In a newly released [Washington Post-Ipsos poll](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/09/19/trump-poll-crime-immigration-economy-tariffs/), [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) appears to be struggling on every front, but the public’s opposition to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s economic performance is especially clear. According to the national survey, 59% of Americans disapprove of the Republican’s handling of the economy, while 64% disapprove of his trade tariffs.

This comes on the heels of the latest national [Faux News poll](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-poll-trumps-ratings-strong-border-security-weak-economy), which found that a 52% majority of Americans believe
[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has made the economy worse since returning to power.

The public’s dissatisfaction is understandable. After all, stubborn inflation data [inched higher](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-house-rolls-weak-new-pitch-economy-trump-slump-continues-rcna229781) last month. [Job growth](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-house-rolls-weak-new-pitch-economy-trump-slump-continues-rcna229781) and the [manufacturing sector](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-tariffs-economy-manufacturing-ism-rcna228790) have also moved in the wrong direction amid [sluggish](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/us-economy-cools-trump-points-phenomenal-numbers-dont-exist-rcna223119) economic growth.

Confronted with this reality, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has some choices. Maybe he could adopt a more sensible economic agenda. Perhaps he could ask Americans to be patient. Maybe he could replace some members of his economic team to signal his dissatisfaction with the status quo.

Or he could do what he’s been doing and just make stuff up.

During a Faux News appearance last week, the [the president boasted](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-interview-fox-and-friends-live-studio-september-12-2025/), “We have the best economy we’ve ever had.” The claim was plainly ridiculous, and it made him appear spectacularly out of touch with public frustrations on the issue.

This week, during [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s trip to the [U.K.](https://www.gov.uk/), he [told reporters](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-press-conference-keir-starmer-united-kingdom-september-18-2025/), “You know, we’ve already solved inflation. We’ve solved prices.”

If that weren’t enough, at the same press conference with [British Prime Minister](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/prime-ministers-office-10-downing-street) [Keir Starmer](https://www.gov.uk/government/people/keir-starmer), the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) said in reference to his own country’s economy, “[Jobs are at a record](https://bsky.app/profile/factpostnews.bsky.social/post/3lz4ksvo7dx2x).”

He didn’t say which “record,” exactly, but the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s own data shows that in the first year of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s second term, job growth has [slowed to levels unseen since the Great Recession](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-house-rolls-weak-new-pitch-economy-trump-slump-continues-rcna229781). That’s not a matter of opinion; it’s simply what the available evidence shows.

So why would the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) point to one of his failures as a success? Because his solution to the [Trump Slump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is to manufacture an alternate reality and hope people play along.

The latest polls suggest that’s not working.

As for the road ahead, a variety of [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) officials have tried to reassure the public that better days [are on the horizon](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-house-rolls-weak-new-pitch-economy-trump-slump-continues-rcna229781) — though they’re not entirely sure when.

[Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov//) [Secretary Scott Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) [recently said](https://x.com/Acyn/status/1957944819298496885) he [expects](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3ly3o4egmjm2h) the economy to “pick up” later this year. [Commerce](https://www.commerce.gov/) [Secretary Howard Lutnick](https://www.commerce.gov/about/leadership/howard-lutnick) expects good news to arrive in “six months” (or maybe 12). Kevin Hassett, who leads the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) National Economic Council, [pointed to next summer](https://x.com/Acyn/status/1964074289537401116).

For his part, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said in his latest [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) interview said [he expects](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-interview-martha-maccallum-fox-news-chequers-united-kingdom-september-18-2025/) the impact of his trade agenda to “kick in probably in a year or so.”

That’s [difficult to believe](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-house-rolls-weak-new-pitch-economy-trump-slump-continues-rcna229781), but it’s worth appreciating the disorienting rhetorical push: Ignoring what the public actually believes, the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is arguing simultaneously that the economy is already great and that the economy will eventually be great at some point, maybe next year.

Is it any wonder why the polls look so ugly for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)?
