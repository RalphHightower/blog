During Superbowl XVIII Apple ran their "1984" Super Bowl Commercial directed by Ridley Scott, starring Anya Major & David Graham, & conceived by Steve Hayden, Brent Thomas & Lee Clow. It's a classic ad that some might say is more relevant in 2023 than ever. Here I have upscaled it using https://www.topazlabs.com/topaz-video... from various sources including ‪@JasonFoxLCB‬'s excellent recreation, Ridley Scott's archives, & other versions on something called YouTube.

## [Attorney General Pam Bondi is wrong about ‘hate speech’ being unprotected expression](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/pam-bondi-hate-speech-first-amendment-rcna231590)

*The [attorney general](https://www.justice.gov/) either misunderstands the law or wants [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) supporters to misunderstand the law.*

Sept. 16, 2025, 11:21 AM EDT
By [Jordan Rubin](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jordan-rubin-ncpn1301611)

Does [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-department-of-justice-independence-ask-jordan-rcna198572) misunderstand the law, or does she want [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s supporters to misunderstand the law? Either would be bad, but the question arises in connection with her recent comments about so-called hate speech.

Speaking on a podcast hosted by Katie Miller (wife of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) aide [Stephen Miller](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/stephen-miller-charlie-kirk-podcast-appearance-jd-vance-rcna231444)), [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) said, “There’s free speech and then there’s hate speech.”

That sounds like the sort of thing that maybe could be true, especially coming from a nominally authoritative figure like the [attorney general](https://www.justice.gov/) of the United States.

But she’s incorrect. The law doesn’t make such a distinction. The point has been reinforced by none other than Justice [Samuel Alito](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-alito-recusal-letter-flag-trump-rcna154550), certainly no wilting liberal. “Speech that demeans on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, age, disability, or any other similar ground is hateful; but the proudest boast of our free speech jurisprudence is that we protect the freedom to express ‘the thought that we hate,’” he wrote in a [2017 opinion](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-1293_1o13.pdf).

Nonetheless, [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) told Miller that the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) “will absolutely target you, go after you, if you are targeting anyone with hate speech.”

The [attorney general](https://www.justice.gov/)’s comments came in the context of last week’s [fatal shooting of Trump ally [Charlie Kirk](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/utah-death-penalty-charlie-kirk-shooting-rcna230792). Though [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) has been celebrated over the last week by conservatives and some liberals as a free speech proponent, the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) and its supporters and enablers [have supported, sought or carried out](https://apnews.com/article/charlie-kirk-workplace-speech-firing-29717a8612ccedebabc7cba29e7ef627) the firings of Americans who have made hateful or even simply critical comments about [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/).

But putting aside the clear political hypocrisy, the legal fact remains that there’s [no hate speech exception](https://www.thefire.org/research-learn/hate-speech-legal) to the [First Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/). On the one hand, that’s comforting insofar as it should defeat any prosecutions attempted by the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) against people for protected speech. Yet, even if one is ultimately successful in defeating any frivolous legal moves, that comfort only extends so far under an [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) whose words and actions show that it has gone after and will continue [to go after people and groups it sees as its opponents](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/15/us/politics/jd-vance-charlie-kirk-show.html). Regardless of the outcome, [no one should want to be targeted](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/biden-pardons-trump-cheney-guilt-ask-jordan-rcna185008) in the first place.

Beyond this one important speech issue, [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general)’s error raises a broader question: If the [attorney general](https://www.justice.gov/) is incorrect about this basic legal premise, what other errors might she be making when it comes to the range of crucial matters that face the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) every day?
