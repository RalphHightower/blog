title: "Glory Hog Trump Takes Credit For Biden’s Infrastructure Legislation"
---

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is a glory hog, stealing credit of others' accomplishments.

## [Four years after trying to kill Biden’s infrastructure bill, Trump now wants credit for it](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/four-years-trying-kill-bidens-infrastructure-bill-trump-now-wants-cred-rcna230116)

*Then, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was desperate to deny [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) a victory on infrastructure. Now, the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) wants credit for the [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)’s accomplishment.*

Sept. 9, 2025, 12:48 PM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

Less than a year into [his presidency](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/), [Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) signed into law one of his top domestic priorities, [a bipartisan infrastructure package](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/what-s-newly-passed-bipartisan-infrastructure-package-n1283450). Almost immediately, cynics predicted that the legislation’s [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) opponents, after condemning the effort as Big Government “socialism,” would be only too pleased to take credit for the investments that reached their states and districts.

To the surprise of no one, the cynics were correct, and more than a few GOP members have spent years [touting infrastructure spending they voted against](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/gop-rep-touts-essential-infrastructure-funds-voted-rcna135217).

As it turns out, however, the problem isn’t limited to Capitol Hill. [The New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/07/us/trump-infrastructure-signs.html):

> *In southern [Connecticut](https://portal.ct.gov/), the federal government is replacing a 118-year-old bridge along America’s busiest rail corridor. The $1.3 billion project was largely funded by the 2021 infrastructure law that was championed by then-[President Joseph R. Biden Jr.](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) — and strenuously opposed by [Donald J. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). These days, however, motorists cruising by the construction site might be forgiven for thinking that a certain famous New York developer was responsible for it all.*

“[PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)” the sign by the road declares. “REBUILDING AMERICA’S INFRASTRUCTURE.”

Four years ago, the [then-former president](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/), desperate to deny his successor a political victory following his own failure on the issue, called the bipartisan infrastructure bill “a loser” for the country and predicted a voter backlash against any [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) who dared to support it. (The package’s [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) proponents ignored the rhetoric and faced no electoral pushback.)

Nevertheless, in recent months, the [Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) noted that signs bearing the incumbent president’s name “now adorn bridge projects in [Connecticut](https://portal.ct.gov/) and [Maryland](https://www.maryland.gov/); rail-yard improvement projects in [Seattle](https://www.seattle.gov/), [Boston](https://www.boston.gov/homepage-bostongov) and [Philadelphia](https://www.phila.gov/); and the replacement of a tunnel on [Amtrak](https://www.amtrak.com/)’s route between [Baltimore](https://www.baltimorecity.gov/) and [Washington](https://dc.gov/).”

In each instance, funding for the projects was made possible by the bill [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) tried to derail in 2021.

I guess [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/)’s accomplishment wasn’t a “loser” after all.

This keeps happening. Last year, amid evidence of a strong U.S. economy, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) demanded that [the credit go to him](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/better-economy-becomes-trump-struggles-talk-rcna178220), rather than [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/), despite the fact the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) wasn’t in office.

After he returned to the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his team started taking credit for domestic investments [that were made while Biden was still president](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-effect-website-takes-credit-us-investment-made-under-biden-2025-07-08/). [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) also claimed credit for reductions in illegal border crossings that [happened before his second inaugural](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/12/06/trump-billionaires-mothers-musk-hegseth/).

On a nearly daily basis, the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) incumbent condemns his [Democratic predecessor](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) as the worst president in history. But if that were true, why does [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) keep seeking credit for [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/)’s work?
