## [Chuck Schumer sets up vote in Senate over release of Epstein files](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/epstein-files-senate-chuck-schumer-rcna230421)

*“The American people need to see everything that’s in the Epstein file, and my amendment would make that happen,” said the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [minority leader](https://bioguide.congress.gov/search/bio/S000148).*

Sept. 10, 2025, 5:10 PM EDT / Updated Sept. 10, 2025, 7:00 PM EDT
By Erum Salam

UPDATE (Sept. 10, 2025, 7:00 p.m. ET): The [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) voted 51-49 to defeat [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Chuck Schumer (D-NY)](https://www.schumer.senate.gov/)’s amendment, with [Sens.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Josh Hawley (T-MO)](https://www.hawley.senate.gov/), and [Rand Paul (T-KY)](https://www.paul.senate.gov/), joining all [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) in opposition.

[Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Minority Leader](https://bioguide.congress.gov/search/bio/S000148) [Chuck Schumer](https://www.schumer.senate.gov/) moved to force a floor vote that would require the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) to release its files on Jeffrey Epstein.

[Schumer](https://www.schumer.senate.gov/) filed an amendment Wednesday to the [National Defense Authorization Act](https://www.congress.gov/committee-report/119th-congress/senate-report/39/1), a must-pass defense bill, with language similar to a discharge petition drafted in the [House](https://www.house.gov/) by [Reps.](https://www.house.gov/) [Thomas Massie (T-KY4)](https://massie.house.gov/) and [Ro Khanna (D-CA17)](https://khanna.house.gov/) [That](https://x.com/UVU/status/1965856814320300326) petition [has almost all 218 signatures needed](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/09/us/politics/epstein-house-vote.html) to force a vote in the [House](https://www.house.gov/) to release the files.

It’s not clear when the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) vote would happen. [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/) notes that any “vote could be on a [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) motion to table or kill the amendment” and that no vote is currently scheduled.

“There has been so much lying, obfuscation, cover-ups. The American people need to see everything that’s in the Epstein file, and my amendment would make that happen,” [Schumer said to reporters](https://www.c-span.org/clip/news-conference/sen-schumer-files-amendment-to-release-epstein-files/5171597).

The [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Oversight Committee](https://oversight.house.gov/) this week obtained a new batch of material from Epstein’s estate via subpoena. Included in that material was a copy of a “birthday book,” an album presented to Epstein on his 50th birthday that features personal notes from powerful individuals. Among these is a [drawing and typed message](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/epstein-birthday-book-trump-drawing-house-oversight-rcna229846) that refers to Epstein as “a pal” and features what appears to be [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s signature. The [White House has said the signature is fake](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-house-jeffrey-epstein-birthday-book-donald-trump-rcna230024).

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) called public interest in Epstein a “dead issue” and insisted the entire narrative is a “hoax.”
