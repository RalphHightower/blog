*After orchestrating the charges against the former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director, does the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) expect to prosecute other foes? Of course he does.*

Sept. 26, 2025, 12:08 PM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

[Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his team are not easily satisfied. For example, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and his [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) operation targeted one law firm; they bullied it into submission; and then they [moved onto other firms](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/law-firms-appeased-trump-consequences-go-bad-worse-rcna213226). [Team Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) targeted one university; [it caved](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/columbia-university-trump-administration-demands-federal-funding-rcna197601); and the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) quickly took aim [at other schools](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/harvard-white-house-demands-punishment-rcna201311).

Just last week, after [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Federal Communications Commission](https://www.fcc.gov/) chair succeeded in temporarily forcing [Jimmy Kimmel](https://abc.com/show/9bfe2f4f-41ad-4492-a6dd-0b67db180543)’s late-night show off of [ABC](https://abc.com/), [Brendan Carr](https://www.fcc.gov/about/leadership/brendan-carr/) told [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) the developments were an “important turning point,” said there was “more work to go” and [quickly turned his attention](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/the-view-brendan-carr-fcc-kimmel-rcna232402) to [“The View.”](https://abc.com/show/70207ea9-cb32-454b-a519-b40106227e32)

Now, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has successfully orchestrated the indictment of one of his political enemies, former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Director James Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/), in an unusually brazen example of corrupting the criminal justice system. What are the odds that the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) will feel satiated and curtail his revenge campaign?

Roughly zero. [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-comey-ryder-cup-netanyahu-gaza-russia-shutdown-live-updates-rcna232822/rcrd89468?canonicalCard=true):

> *As he departed the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) for the [Ryder Cup tournament](https://www.rydercup.com/), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was asked by a reporter who ‘the next person on your list in this retribution’ will be now that [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/) has been indicted. ‘It’s not a list. I think there will be others. I mean they’re corrupt,’ [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said. ‘These were corrupt radical left [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) because [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/) was essentially a — he’s worse than a [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/).’*

Obviously, this was largely gibberish. Neither the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) nor those around him have ever presented credible evidence of his [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) foes being “corrupt.” On the contrary, those looking for evidence of actual corruption [look no further than Trump’s charges against Comey](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-orchestrates-james-comey-indictment-fbi-justice-corruption-rcna233857).

The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) added that the case against the former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director is “not revenge.” No serious person could believe such an absurdity.

Indeed, [we’ve discussed](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-orchestrates-james-comey-indictment-fbi-justice-corruption-rcna233857), Erik Siebert, the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-nominated U.S. attorney for the [Eastern District of Virginia](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/), [refused to pursue this case](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/forcing-disobedient-prosecutor-trumps-new-nominee-makes-matters-worse-rcna232922), insisting that it lacked merit. Career prosecutors explained [in detail and in writing](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/former-fbi-director-james-comey-facing-imminent-indictment-threat-rcna233539) that the evidence didn’t support charging [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/). By some accounts, [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) herself was [not](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/justice-department-officials-race-to-charge-james-comey-as-deadline-looms-4da7c71f?mod=hp_lead_pos2) on [board](https://politicalwire.com/2025/09/25/pam-bondi-has-concerns-over-indicting-james-comey/) with this indictment and voiced concerns behind the scenes.

Even John Durham, a [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-appointed special counsel, reviewed the allegations and [opted not to follow through](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/james-comey-indictment-congress-fbi-director-rcna233691).

The prosecution is advancing anyway because [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) fired the prosecutor who insisted on following the law, ignored the career prosecutors who did their job, dismissed the concerns of his sycophantic attorney general and used an unqualified loyalist, just days into her tenure, to exact revenge against a former ally who dared to cross him.

[MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/)’s [Ken Dilanian reported](https://x.com/DilanianMSNBC/status/1971353961375596668) that within the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/), many insiders believe this is “among the worst abuses” in the history of the institution.

“There will be others” suggests that we ought to append a caveat: this is among the worst abuses so far. Because [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/) is hardly the only, or the last, person on [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s enemies list.
