## [Epstein files continue to dog Kash Patel at Senate hearing](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kash-patel-fbi-senate-epstein-files-rcna231668)

*[Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) and [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) lawmakers grilled the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director on what he knows about documents related to the late convicted sex offender.*

Sept. 16, 2025, 3:49 PM EDT
By Erum Salam

At [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Director Kash Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [judiciary](http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/) hearing on Tuesday, the controversy around [the Epstein files](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-esptein-files-petition-ro-khanna-rcna230592) — which has divided those who are demanding more answers from the government about the late convicted sex offender and those, like [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), who claim it’s “[a dead issue](https://www.msnbc.com/ana-cabrera-reports/watch/trump-jeffrey-epstein-s-birthday-letter-is-a-dead-issue-247179333666)” — proved inescapable.

[Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) first clashed with lawmakers about his [handling of the investigation](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/watch/fbi-director-kash-patel-faces-new-scrutiny-over-charlie-kirk-investigation-247527493933) into the fatal shooting of conservative influencer [Charlie Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) last week, with particular questions about his [premature announcement](https://x.com/DirectorKash/status/1965903392934633587) of an individual in custody who, along with a second subject, was later released after investigators determined they had no connection to the shooting.

But the topic of [senators](https://www.senate.gov/)’ questions quickly changed to Jeffrey Epstein.

When asked by [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [John Kennedy (T-LA)](https://www.kennedy.senate.gov/) “Who, if anyone, did Epstein traffic these young women to besides himself?” [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) said the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) had “no credible information” that Epstein trafficked people to anyone other than himself.

“If there were, I’d bring the case yesterday that he trafficked to other individuals,” [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) said.

[Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) said prior administrations had sat on the files, and he blamed his limited ability to speak publicly on the subject on Alex Acosta, who was labor secretary in [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [first administration](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/) and the [prosecutor of Epstein’s 2006 case in Florida](https://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/watch/secretary-acosta-refuses-to-apologize-for-epstein-plea-deal-63629381882) in [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/). Acosta signed off on Epstein’s [plea deal](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/the-completely-unprecedented-plea-deal-jeffrey-epstein-made-with-alex-acosta) — characterized by [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) on Tuesday as a “get-out-of-jail free card” — that allowed him to avoid prosecution and resulted in “limited search warrants” that, [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) said, continue to cloud transparency into Epstein’s actions.

“We will release everything we are legally permitted to do so,” [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) added.

“I strongly encourage you to do that, Kash. This issue’s not going to go away,” [Kennedy](https://www.kennedy.senate.gov/) said, adding, “I think you’re going to have to do more to satisfy the American people’s understandable curiosity in that regard.”

After [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Richard Blumenthal (D-CT)](https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/)  harshly criticized [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) for [firing experienced FBI employees](https://apnews.com/article/fired-fbi-agents-lawsuit-patel-trump-4431bc93e2783b3b9c658ece82476742) as part of political retribution, he also grilled him about Epstein.

In a rare display of bipartisan alignment, [Blumenthal](https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/) followed [Kennedy](https://www.kennedy.senate.gov/)’s line of questioning and asked [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) if he could “commit to make public the Epstein files that have so far not been released.” [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) affirmed he will give [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) what is legally permitted to the maximum extent of law.
