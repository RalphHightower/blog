## [‘I’m Gonna Punch You in Your Fucking Face’: Scott Bessent Threatens an Administration Rival - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/09/08/scott-bessent-bill-pulte-blowup-00549956)

*The [Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/) [secretary](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent/)'s quiet tensions with [housing finance](https://www.fhfa.gov/) [chief Bill Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte) exploded at a private dinner last week.*

Rachael Bade is POLITICO's Capitol bureau chief and senior Washington columnist. She is a former co-author of POLITICO Playbook and co-author of "Unchecked: The Untold Story Behind Congress's Botched Impeachments of [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)." Her reported column, Corridors, illuminates how power pulses through Washington, from Capitol Hill to the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and beyond.

A private dinner attended by dozens of [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) officials and close advisers to [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was temporarily marred by a dramatic clash between two of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s top economic officials, with [Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/) [Secretary Scott Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) at one point threatening to punch top housing finance official [Bill Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte) “in the fucking face.”

The Wednesday evening event was supposed to be one of celebration: It was both the much-anticipated inaugural dinner at [Executive Branch](https://www.executivebranch.com/), the ultra-exclusive Georgetown club created by and for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) world’s uberrich, and a birthday party for MAGA-friendly podcaster Chamath Palihapitiya.

A long table for the 30-some guests was set with top-of-the-line crystal and china. The guest list included [Transportation](https://www.transportation.gov/) [Secretary Sean Duffy](https://www.transportation.gov/meet-secretary/us-transportation-secretary-sean-duffy), [Commerce](https://www.commerce.gov/) [Secretary Howard Lutnick](https://www.commerce.gov/about/leadership/howard-lutnick), [Interior](https://www.doi.gov/) [Secretary Doug Burgum](https://www.doi.gov/secretary-doug-burgum), [Agriculture](https://www.usda.gov/) [Secretary Brooke Rollins](https://www.usda.gov/our-agency/about-usda/our-secretary), [Director of National Intelligence](https://www.odni.gov/) [Tulsi Gabbard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tulsigabbard/), [SBA](https://www.sba.gov/) [Administrator Kelly Loeffler](https://www.sba.gov/person/kelly-loeffler), [Medicare](https://www.medicare.gov/) and [Medicaid](https://www.medicaid.gov/) [chief Mehmet Oz](https://www.cms.gov/about-cms/who-we-are/leadership/office-administrator-0#biography-0), plus venture capitalist David Sacks, Palihapitiya’s partner on the “All In” podcast.

But amid the cocktail-hour din, [Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) lashed out at [Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte) in an expletive-laden diatribe. The [Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/) secretary had heard from several people that the [Federal Housing Finance Agency](https://www.fhfa.gov/) director had been badmouthing him to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), a person close to him said. He wasn’t about to engage in chit-chat as if nothing was amiss.

“Why the fuck are you talking to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) about me? Fuck you,” [Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) told [Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte). “I’m gonna punch you in your fucking face.”

The scene was described to me by one eyewitness and four other people familiar with what happened. The only fact they disagreed on was whether it was [Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) or [Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte) who initiated the conversation. They and others who described the conflict were granted anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation.

[Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte) appeared stunned, and the tense encounter prompted club co-owner and financier [Omeed Malik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/omeed-malik-b483b1186/) to intervene, according to the three people. But [Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) wasn’t having it — he sought to get him kicked out, the eyewitness said.

“It’s either me or him,” [Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) said to [Malik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/omeed-malik-b483b1186/). “You tell me who’s getting the fuck out of here.”

“Or,” he added, “we could go outside.”

“To do what?” asked [Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte). “To talk?”

“No,” [Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) replied. “I’m going to fucking beat your ass.”

Seeking to deescalate the situation, [Malik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/omeed-malik-b483b1186/) separated the men, walking [Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) to another part of the club to calm down. During the seated dinner, [Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) and [Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte) were placed on opposite ends of the table, and the party went off without further episode.

[Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent), [Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte), [Malik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/omeed-malik-b483b1186/) and the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) declined to comment.

The confrontation — which one [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) insider called “bonkers” and another called “unhinged” — underscores the surprising tensions between top [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) officials tasked with working on the nation’s most sensitive economic matters.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) announced in May that [Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent), [Lutnick](https://www.commerce.gov/about/leadership/howard-lutnick) and [Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte) would collaborate on a plan to [privatize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)/posts/114548257487682819), the federal housing finance organs [Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte) oversees. In recent weeks, [Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte) has taken the lead on an initiative that could put as [much as 15 percent of Fannie and Freddie](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/08/fannie-mae-freddie-mac-public-offerings-trump-00499944) on the public markets.

But behind the scenes, the two men have clashed in something of a turf war over the mortgage giants as well as other economic matters, four [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) insiders told me. [Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) believes, some of the people familiar with their conflict say, that [Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte) has inserted himself into matters the secretary views as his jurisdiction. [Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte), they add, has bristled at the threat of being bigfooted.

Complicating the entire dynamic, according to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) allies closely following the drama, is [Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte)’s close ties to [Lutnick](https://www.commerce.gov/about/leadership/howard-lutnick). The [Commerce](https://www.commerce.gov/) [secretary](https://www.commerce.gov/about/leadership/howard-lutnick/) and [Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) have had a rocky relationship since the transition, when the two men competed for the Treasury position. That has injected significant distrust into anything the trio work on together.

It was why [Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) — who feels he doesn’t have time for drama and backbiting given his massive portfolio, according to the person close to him — hit the roof when he saw [Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte) Wednesday.

Both men enjoy close relationships with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and are known within the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s orbit to openly jockey for influence and power — albeit in different ways.

[Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent), who comes across publicly as soft-spoken, has won [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s trust as a [“soothing” presence](https://www.facebook.com/horsemansvoice/posts/the-white-housetravel-pool-16-more-potus-bessent-to-fed-thoughts-on-firing-powel/1270172785119248/?_rdr) for jittery markets amid the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s unpredictable plays on tariffs and other economic issues. A cautious operator who’s been called a [“moderating influence”](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/04/13/scott-bessent-trump-spending-00286211) on the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/), the billionaire former hedge fund manager has overcome his past association with [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) megadonor George Soros and is now considered one of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s closest allies.

Meanwhile, [Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte) — a brash 37-year-old with 3 million X followers — has taken a more pugnacious tack in his lower-profile job. The scion of a family that made a fortune building homes, he quickly [more than 100 Fannie and Freddie staffers](https://www.fhfa.gov/news/news-release/fannie-mae-fires-over-100-employees-for-unethical-conduct-including-the-facilitation-of-fraud) as he took direct control of the key housing finance entities — often rolling out [new initiatives on X](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/08/07/bill-pulte-trump-powell/).

In recent weeks his stock in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and in the MAGA universe more broadly has risen as he has used his post to launch mortgage-related investigations into several of the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s critics. His efforts to target [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) [Governor Lisa Cook](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/cook.htm) — alleging she sought mortgages for multiple “primary” residences — have redoubled pressure on the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) as [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) presses for lower interest rates.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) moved to fire [Cook](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/cook.htm), a [Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) appointee, last month. She has called the allegations unsubstantiated and is suing to challenge her ouster. The case is pending.

Relatedly, [Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) and [Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte) have been on opposite sides of the debate about whether [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) should fire [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) [Chair Jerome Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm). [Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent), as my colleagues Megan Messerly and Victoria Guida [scooped earlier this year](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/17/trump-powell-fired-fed-00295552), had privately cautioned that such a decapitation would destabilize financial markets.

[Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte), on the other hand, has repeatedly called on [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) to resign and has taken the position that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has the power to fire the chair for cause based on his alleged mismanagement of costly Fed headquarters renovations. [Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte) even gave [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) a draft letter firing [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm), the [Washington Post reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/07/16/president-trump-is-preparing-fire-fed-chair/) in July.

Wednesday’s dustup also wasn’t the first time [Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) has gotten into an altercation with a fellow [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) official. In April, he [confronted Elon Musk](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/23/musk-bessent-trump-white-house-irs) just outside the [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), accusing the tech mogul — then running his [Department of Government Efficiency](https://doge.gov/) initiative — in a profanity-laden tirade of going behind his back to secure his chosen candidate, Gary Shapley, as acting [IRS](https://www.irs.gov/) commissioner.

[Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) was pushing for another man, Deputy Treasury Secretary Michael Faulkender, to get the job — and eventually got his way. Faulkender [left the department](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/22/treasury-official-faulkender-leaving-00519525) late last month after just five months on the job.
