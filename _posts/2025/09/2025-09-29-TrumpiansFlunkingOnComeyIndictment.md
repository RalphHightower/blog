*Pressed on [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s case against the former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director, [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) lawmakers are pushing the wrong talking points for the wrong reasons.*

Sept. 26, 2025, 2:43 PM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

On Thursday night, in [one of the most dramatic abuses](https://x.com/DilanianMSNBC/status/1971353961375596668) in the history of the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/), [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [successfully orchestrated the indictment](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-orchestrates-james-comey-indictment-fbi-justice-corruption-rcna233857) of former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Director James Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/), one of his prominent political enemies. Many congressional [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) recognized the seriousness of the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s scandalous move.

[Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Chris Murphy (D-CT)](https://www.murphy.senate.gov/), for example, [argued via Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/chrismurphyct.bsky.social/post/3lzpbd7iews2m), “We aren’t on a slippery slope to a constitutional crisis. We are in the crisis. Time for leaders — political leaders, business leaders, civic leaders — to pick a side: democracy or autocracy?”

Some of his [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) colleagues on Capitol Hill did not exactly rise to the occasion. [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/) rounded up [a sampling of congressional GOP reactions](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-tiktok-erdogan-shutdown-israel-gaza-russia-ukraine-live-updates-rcna232821/rcrd89427?canonicalCard=true):

> *[Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Mike Simpson (T-ID2)](https://simpson.house.gov/) posted: ‘Good to see the [DOJ](https;//www.justice.gov/) treating lying to [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) as a serious matter. I guess [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/)’s ‘Higher Calling’ wasn’t to the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/) or the [laws of the United States](https://uscode.house.gov/).’ [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Byron Donalds (T-FL19)](https://donalds.house.gov/) said, ‘[James Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/) wrongly wielded weaponized bureaucracy and lawfare to derail a duly elected [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).’ ‘Russiagate was a complete hoax, and those that perpetrated this should face justice. No one is above the law,’ [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Tim Burchett (T-TN2)](https://burchett.house.gov/), wrote in a post.*

It’s tempting to remind congressional [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) that nearly every prosecutor who evaluated the case against [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/) — including a [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-nominated U.S. attorney and a [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-appointed special counsel — agreed that there was [no point in pursuing this case](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-orchestrates-james-comey-indictment-fbi-justice-corruption-rcna233857). Similarly, I’d love to explain once again that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Russia](http://government.ru/) scandal [was not a “hoax,”](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-shouldnt-try-draw-parallels-epstein-russian-scandals-rcna219377) no matter how many times he and his allies pretend otherwise.
But of even greater interest right now is a reaction to the latest developments from  [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Mike Rounds (T-SD)](https://www.rounds.senate.gov/).


Asked on [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/) about the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) weaponizing the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) to target his political enemies, [Rounds said](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3lzqvxdvk2l2i) he was content to “let the courts sort this out.” He similarly suggested that the public probably [doesn’t much care](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3lzqw4nox6t2e) about [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) shattering the country’s democratic norms.

And when Manu Raju asked specifically about the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) directing the [attorney general](https://www.justice.gov/) to go after his political opponents, the senator, after again punting the issue to the courts, [replied](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3lzqw67cylc2d), “I think we need to stay in our lane right now, and our lane is doing our job.”

There are some senators who are relatively new to the institution and have little experience in governing or policymaking, and it would be easy to understand how they might be confused about what does and does not fall under the purview of senators.

But [Rounds](https://www.rounds.senate.gov/) isn’t one of them. The [South Dakotan](https://www.rounds.senate.gov/) is not a rookie: After a decade in the state legislature, [Rounds](https://www.rounds.senate.gov/) served eight years as a governor, and he’s been in the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) for more than a decade. He knows how government works.

So the senator must realize that [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) has oversight responsibilities over the executive branch. Indeed, both the [House](https://www.house.gov/) and [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) have whole committees that are focused almost exclusively on oversight.

Lawmakers have launched investigations and held hearings into [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) controversies for centuries.

When a [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) corrupts the criminal justice system and [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) finds out about it, this is absolutely in lawmakers’ “lane.”

If [Rounds](https://www.rounds.senate.gov/) doesn’t want to bother with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s scandals because he and the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) are [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/), he can say so. But to pretend that [presidential](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) abuses are none of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/)’ business is ridiculous.
