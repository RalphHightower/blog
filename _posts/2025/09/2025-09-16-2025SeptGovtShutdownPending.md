## [Facing a government shutdown deadline, Republicans place a risky bet](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/facing-government-shutdown-deadline-republicans-place-risky-bet-rcna231734)

*At [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s behest, [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) leaders hope to prevent a shutdown with a partisan bill that ignores the concerns of [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/), whose votes they'll need.*

Sept. 16, 2025, 3:28 PM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

Lately, on a nearly daily basis, [Democratic leaders in Congress](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/chuck-schumer-democrats-leadership-strategy-rcna196928) have issued some kind of [public statements](https://bsky.app/profile/factpostnews.bsky.social/post/3lyxvsputsk2w), reminding [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) of the upcoming government shutdown deadline, and urging the [GOP majority](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/mike-johnson-yield-man-democrats-trump-rcna230141) to work on a bipartisan solution.

On a nearly daily basis, [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) ignore those appeals and move forward with a partisan plan intended to keep the government’s lights on. That trend continued Tuesday afternoon, when [House](https://www.house.gov/) [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) leaders [unveiled a stopgap spending bill](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-republicans-release-bill-government-funded-shutdown-rcna231699) (called a continuing resolution, or “CR”) that would prevent a shutdown and push the next deadline to Nov. 21. [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) realize that [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) expect to see a solution that addresses health care policy, but the majority disregarded the minority party’s demands.

“The [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)-only spending bill fails to meet the needs of the American people and does nothing to stop the looming healthcare crisis,” [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Minority Leader](https://bioguide.congress.gov/search/bio/S000148) [Chuck Schumer (D-NY)](https://www.schumer.senate.gov/) and [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Minority Leader](http://democraticleader.house.gov/) [Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY8)](https://jeffries.house.gov/) said in a joint statement. The [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) added, “At a time when families are already being squeezed by higher costs, [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) refuse to stop Americans from facing double-digit hikes in their health insurance premiums.”

[GOP](https://www.gop.com/) leaders’ apparent indifference to [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)ic concerns didn't come out of nowhere: It reflects [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s directive to his party. Though it didn’t generate a lot of coverage, [Politico reported](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/12/donald-trump-shutdown-democrats-00560031) late last week:

President [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) dismissed congressional [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/)’ demands ahead of a looming shutdown deadline in a Fox News interview Friday, casting doubt on whether a deal to keep the government open is even possible. ‘There is something wrong with them,’ [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said about [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) in a rare in-studio ‘Fox and Friends’ interview. ... ‘Don’t even bother dealing with them,’ he added. ‘We will get it through because the [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) are sticking together for the first time in a long time.’

I’m not in a position to say with confidence what the president does and does not understand. But in reality, whether [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) are prepared to “stick together” or not isn’t the only question: In the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/), any bill to prevent a shutdown will need to clear a 60-vote procedural hurdle — and there are 53 [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) in the chamber.

It’s a point that seemed to confuse [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) in his interview on Friday. “We have to get [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) votes. That’s all,” he claimed. Asked about the 60-vote threshold, he added, “No. We’re going to do a — probably a continuing resolution, or we’re going to do something. So we’re going to do something.”

That didn’t exactly sound like a solid plan.

With two weeks remaining before the deadline, one of six things will soon happen:

1. [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) will struggle to pass their own bill in a narrowly divided [House](https://www.house.gov/), making a shutdown all but inevitable.
2. [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) will struggle to pass their own bill in a narrowly divided [House](https://www.house.gov/), forcing [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) leaders to make concessions to [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/), which would very likely prevent a shutdown.
3. [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) will pass their bill in the [House](https://www.house.gov/), but [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) will largely stick together (basically everyone other than [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [John Fetterman (D-PA)](https://www.fetterman.senate.gov/), making a shutdown all but inevitable.
4. [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) will cave and accept changes made to satisfy [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/), making a shutdown far less likely.
5. Several [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) ([Fetterman](https://www.fetterman.senate.gov/) and at least six others) will fold and accept the [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/)’ bill in order to prevent a shutdown.
6. [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) will rely on the “nuclear strategy” to change the rules and pass their bill by majority rule, lowering the threshold in the chamber from 60 votes to 50.

Which of these scenarios will play out? The answer will unfold over the next 14 days. Watch this space.
