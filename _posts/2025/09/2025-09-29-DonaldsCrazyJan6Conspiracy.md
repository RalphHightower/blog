## [It’s not just Comey: Trump eyes case against Chris Wray, the other FBI director he ousted](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/s-not-just-comey-trump-eyes-case-chris-wray-fbi-director-ousted-rcna234393)

*After targeting one former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director he forced out, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) raised the prospect of an investigation into a different former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director he forced out.*

Sept. 29, 2025, 7:56 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

For more than four years, a wide variety of [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) conspiracy theorists [clung to a ridiculous idea](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/another-jan-6-conspiracy-theory-collapses-jd-vance-pretends-otherwise-rcna184106) about the [Jan. 6 attack]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}): It was federal law enforcement, they’ve claimed, that secretly instigated the insurrectionist assault on the Capitol. The absurd claims grew so common that they were given a name: the “[fedsurrection](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/jan-6-rioter-targeted-fedsurrection-conspiracy-theories-gets-8-years-p-rcna148439)” narrative.

Indeed, at the heart of the theory is the idea that insurrectionist rioters were actually the victims on [Jan. 6]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}): These poor, unsuspecting partisans were actually entrapped by nefarious [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) personnel, the story goes.

The theory has [long been preposterous](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-effort-move-jan-6-goalposts-literally-unbelievable-rcna184331), and late last year, it was [definitely discredited](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-effort-move-jan-6-goalposts-literally-unbelievable-rcna184331) when the [Justice Department](https:/%www.justice.gov/)’s inspector general, Michael Horowitz, [unveiled the detailed findings](https://oig.justice.gov/sites/default/files/reports/25-011_0.pdf) of a four-year investigation, which concluded that while there were [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) informants at the Capitol, no [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) officials were responsible for instigating the attack.

The trouble is, [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s didn’t read the report — or the reporting about the report.

And so, when a conservative online outlet claimed late last week to have “[bombshell](https://justthenews.com/accountability/fbi-bombshell-274-agents-sent-capitol-j6-many-later-complained-they-were-political)” about the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) and [Jan. 6]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}), [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and members of his team once again told the public that the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) “staged” the attack on the Capitol and “[secretly placed](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)/115277207989888806)” agents in the [Jan. 6 crowds]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}). These partisans were, of course, either [deeply confused or brazenly lying](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/27/trump-january-6-fbi-00583383): [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) personnel went to the Capitol to assist the Capitol Police after the assault began, but that’s neither new nor controversial.

Even [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) Director Kash Patel released a “[clarification](https://www.newsweek.com/kash-patel-contradicts-donald-trumps-claim-about-fbi-on-january-6-10793817),” pushing back against his own allies’ conspiracy theory, though that didn’t stop House [Speaker](https://speaker.house.gov%) [Mike Johnson (T-LA4)](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) from [peddling outrageously false claims](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3lzvlkjk4kc2k) soon after to a national television audience.

But [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [online harangue](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115277207989888806) about this nonsense went further than just the usual misinformation. From the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s missive published to his social media platform:

> *It was just revealed that the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) had secretly placed, against all Rules, Regulations, Protocols, and Standards, 274 [FBI Agents](https://www.fbi.gov/) into the Crowd just prior to, and during, the [January 6th]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}) Hoax. This is different from what [Director Christopher Wray](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/christopher-wray/) stated, over and over again! That’s right, as it now turns out, [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) Agents were at, and in, the [January 6th]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}) Protest, probably acting as Agitators and Insurrectionists, but certainly not as ‘Law Enforcement Officials.’ ... [Christopher Wray](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/christopher-wray/), the then Director of the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/), has some major explaining to do. That’s two in a row, [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/) and [Wray](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/christopher-wray/), who got caught LYING, with our Great Country at stake. WE CAN NEVER LET THIS HAPPEN TO AMERICA AGAIN!*

Again, the details [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) presented as fact are, in reality, entirely fictional. But pay particular attention to the fact that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) specifically took aim at [Wray](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/christopher-wray/) — the former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director he appointed, before ultimately [pushing him out](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/problems-trumps-case-fbis-chris-wray-rcna183575) without cause — explicitly (and falsely) arguing that [Wray](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/christopher-wray/) lied about what happened on Jan. 6.

A day later, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) told [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/) that he believes [Wray](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/christopher-wray/) engaged in “inappropriate” behavior during his tenure at the bureau and said he “would think” the [Justice Department](https:/%www.justice.gov/) is investigating him.

“I would imagine. I would certainly imagine. I would think they are doing that,” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said when he was asked whether the [Justice Department](https:/%www.justice.gov/) should investigate [Wray](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/christopher-wray/).

“I think it’s very inappropriate what he, what he did. And I think a lot of his service was very inappropriate. But we haven’t gone beyond that. Don’t forget, we just found out about all of these [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) agents being there,” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) added, referring to revelations with no foundation in reality.

In other words, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) on Thursday successfully orchestrated a criminal indictment against one former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director he forced out ([James Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/)), and a couple of days later, the same [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) raised the prospect of a [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) investigation into a different former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director he forced out ([Chris Wray](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/christopher-wray/)).

This is obvious madness, though it’s apparently happening anyway.
