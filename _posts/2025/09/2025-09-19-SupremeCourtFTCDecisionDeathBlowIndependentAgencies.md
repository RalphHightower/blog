## [The Supreme Court’s FTC ruling is a death sentence for independent agencies](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/supreme-court-trump-ftc-commissioner-firing-independent-agencies-rcna230129)

*This decision signals the beginning of the end of these agencies that were created to protect the interests of the American people.*

Sept. 10, 2025, 6:00 AM EDT
By Andrew Warren, senior counsel at Democracy Defenders Action

On Monday, [the [Supreme Court turned a blind eye](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/john-roberts-ftc-commissioner-supreme-court-rebecca-slaughter-rcna229418) to [President Donald Trump’s unlawful termination](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-ftc-commissioner-firings-lina-khan-rcna197317) of a [Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-ignores-supreme-court-precedent-fires-democrats-helped-lead-inde-rcna197101). In doing so, the court further strengthened the hand of an [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) intent on tightening its grip on every aspect of the federal government. Once again, [the nation’s highest court used its shadow docket](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-emergency-docket-deadline-newsletter-rcna215906) to [overturn two lower court rulings](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-shadow-docket-los-angeles-roving-patrols-rcna230147) with minimal explanation — or, in this case, with no explanation at all. Once again, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) asked a highly partisan [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) to rubber-stamp a blatantly political action, one that clearly violates the spirit and letter of the law — and the court obliged.

This ruling, however, is bad not only for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s critics but also for the viability of independent agencies. By rewriting the rules for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), the court has opened the door for future [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)s of both parties to exploit its precedent. This decision signals the beginning of the end of these agencies that were created to protect the interests of the American people, not serve the political whims of whoever occupies the Oval Office.

> *Allowing a [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) to fire commissioners or board members who refuse to do his bidding eviscerates an agency’s autonomy.*

The [Federal Trade Commission](https://www.ftc.gov/) is an independent watchdog agency created in 1914 to protect the public from deceptive or unfair business practices. For more than a century, the [FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/) has sought to be an objective referee of the marketplace by promoting competition, preventing monopolies and stopping scams and frauds. [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) specifically designed the [FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/) to be bipartisan and independent. The five commissioners have staggered seven-year terms, no more than three can be from the same political party, and they can be removed by the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) only for “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”

The only previous time a [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) attempted to remove an [FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/) commissioner was in 1933, when Franklin D. Roosevelt fired William Humphrey — who was appointed by Roosevelt’s predecessor, Herbert Hoover — over policy differences. Humphrey challenged his dismissal, and in the landmark 1935 case of [Humphrey’s Executor](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/295/602/#tab-opinion-1934749), the [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) unanimously ruled the restriction on the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s removal power to be constitutional and declared Humphrey’s termination illegal. The court explained that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s power over the executive branch is not without limits and that [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/)’ authority to create independent agencies not subject to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s control “cannot well be doubted.”

That was then.

In March, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) fired [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, whom he himself had appointed in 2018, claiming her service is “inconsistent with my [Administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s priorities.” Slaughter sued, and in July, [U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan ruled](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.278902/gov.uscourts.dcd.278902.51.0_1.pdf) in her favor, citing Humphrey’s nearly identical case from 90 years earlier.

But in between Slaughter’s filing her lawsuit and AliKhan’s ruling, the [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) weakened the independence of other federal agencies. In May, it paused lower court rulings reinstating members of the [National Labor Relations Board](https://www.nlrb.gov/) and the [Merit Systems Protection Board](https://www.mspb.gov/) whom [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) had fired without cause, in violation of the applicable laws. The [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) did not consider the appeals of those rulings — which had been [upheld by an appellate court](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25880731-harrisbessentcadcord040725/) — in its usual manner of extensive briefing and oral argument. Instead, it used its emergency docket — also known as the “shadow docket” — to stop the rulings from being implemented while offering scant accounting of its reasoning. In a [two-page ruling](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24a966_1b8e.pdf) (the judicial equivalent of condensing a John Grisham novel into a tweet), the [Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/)’s majority indicated that the for-cause removal restrictions for the [NLRB](https://www.nlrb.gov/) and the [MSPB](https://www.mspb.gov/) were unconstitutional.

On Monday, only six days after [the U.S. Court of Appeals for Washington, D.C., approved](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26080986-slaughtertrumpcadcord090225/) the lower court’s reinstatement of Slaughter’s going into effect, [Chief Justice](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) Roberts issued [a two-sentence order](https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/090825zr_4f15.pdf), with no explanation, that reversed course and permits Slaughter’s removal.

> *[Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) precedent, of course, outlasts any [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/).*

Humphrey’s Executor is on life support. That presumably means nothing to the majority of Americans, but they will certainly feel the impact of its loss. [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) established many independent agencies with express limits on the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s removal authority. Examples include the [National Transportation Safety Board](https://www.ntsb.gov/), the [Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission](https://www.oshrc.gov/), the [Federal Housing Finance Agency](https://www.fhfa.gov/) and the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/), just to name a few. (In its May ruling, the [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/)’s majority expressly distinguished the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) from the [NLRB](https://www.nlrb.gov/) and the [MSPB](https://www.mspb.gov/). Justice Elena Kagan’s dissent welcomed that distinction “to avoid imperiling the Fed” but noted it was “out of the blue” because the Fed’s independence rests on the same legal foundation as that of those and other agencies.)

As the [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) explained in Humphrey’s, for-cause removal goes hand in hand with an agency’s independence. Allowing a [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) to fire commissioners or board members who refuse to do his bidding eviscerates an agency’s autonomy. With Monday’s ruling, the [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) is not merely reinterpreting Humphrey’s to narrow its application for other agencies. It is throwing out the precedent completely, giving nearly limitless power to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to force every supposedly independent federal agency to serve his political interests.

We would be naive to expect the demise of agencies’ independence to miraculously reappear after this [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) leaves office. [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) precedent, of course, outlasts any [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/).

As the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) swings back and forth between parties, we can expect significant policy changes from different [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)s’ handpicked loyalists who are responsible for keeping our highways and skyways running smoothly, setting workplace safety standards and maintaining the stability of our housing finance system, as well as controlling the monetary policy that affects our mortgage payments, fortifies our economy and protects against hyperinflation.

Even worse, we could see the extreme politicization of these agencies. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) supporters who cheer the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s having absolute authority over (formerly) independent agencies will shudder to think about, for example, the [Federal Communications Commission](https://www.fcc.gov/)’s enforcing truth-in-advertising rules only against conservative media outlets or the [Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.epa.gov/)’s fast-tracking permits and subsidies for renewable energy projects that use union labor.

[Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) made the [FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/) independent to insulate it from the “volatile political headwinds that might jeopardize its mission,” as Judge AliKhan wrote in her ruling reinstating Slaughter. That insulation from political pressure promotes independent agencies’ effectiveness, maintains their credibility and ensures that they serve the public, not the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). But this [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/), in egregious acts of what conservatives usually decry as judicial activism, is circumventing [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/)’ intent and putting these agencies under the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s thumb.

For nearly a century, for-cause removal protections have helped preserve our constitutional system by balancing power between the legislative and executive branches and protecting critical federal agencies from the political interests of the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). Overturning that precedent does not merely weaken the [FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/) and other agencies; it fundamentally changes the checks and balances that safeguard our democracy and guarantee our liberty. Placing this new power in the hands of current and future [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)s leads to a government in which public accountability is a mirage and partisan loyalty is reality.

[Andrew Warren](https://www.democracydefendersaction.org/our-team) is senior counsel at [Democracy Defenders Action](https://www.democracydefendersaction.org/). He previously was a prosecutor with the [U.S. [lJustice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) and the elected district attorney in [Tampa](https://www.tampa.gov/), [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/).

“I don’t have any additional actions to preview for today, but I can tell you this is a priority for the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) and the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is unafraid to use the economic might, the military might, of the United States to protect free speech around the world,” she said.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is actually waging an open assault on free speech in the United States (famously, part of “the world”). So Leavitt’s spin here is detached from reality. But her reference to “military might” in the context of defending an ousted authoritarian ruler is noteworthy. Not only does such a threat run counter to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s campaign vow to avoid launching new wars, but it also arguably puts [Brazil](https://www.gov.br/) on notice that the U.S. may consider using force to prevent the country from holding Bolsonaro accountable.

It’s unclear whether Leavitt’s remarks here are mere bluster from a press secretary who’s made that her calling card. I’ve reached out to the [Defense Department](https://www.defense.gov/) for clarity on its position on [Brazil](https://www.gov.br/).

Nonetheless, Leavitt’s remarks are undeniably ominous. The [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s missile strike on a civilian boat off the coast of [Venezuela](https://gob.ve/) arguably demonstrates its willingness to use [military force](https://www.jcs.mil/) with South American nations that run afoul of its agenda or misalign with its politics.

And in the case of [Brazil](https://www.gov.br/), many Americans may have concerns about the prospect of the [U.S. military](https://www.jcs.mil/) being used just to protect one of the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s authoritarian allies.
