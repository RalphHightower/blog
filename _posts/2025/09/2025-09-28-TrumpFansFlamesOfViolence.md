## [Asked about violence, Trump warns left not to provoke the right: ‘Bad things happen’](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/asked-violence-trump-warns-left-not-provoke-right-bad-things-happen-rcna233932)

*The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) told one side of the political divide not to “energize” the other side — because those aligned with him are “tougher.”*

Sept. 26, 2025, 12:59 PM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

Just two days after the shooting death of conservative activist [Charlie Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/), [Donald [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) appeared on [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) and made an awful situation [much worse](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-finds-new-unsettling-way-excuse-radicals-right-rcna230856). The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) not only falsely claimed that the left was responsible for much of the nation’s political violence — recent [evidence](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jd-vances-statistical-fact-political-violence-neither-statistical-fact-rcna231630) [suggests](https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/20/politics/political-violence-data-analysis) [otherwise](https://www.pbump.net/o/elon-musk-should-buy-a-introductory-data-course/) — he also seemed to excuse violence on the right, insisting that most far-right extremists have [good reason](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-finds-new-unsettling-way-excuse-radicals-right-rcna230856) to commit acts of violence.

“The radicals on the right oftentimes are radical because they don’t want to see crime,” he said.

Such excuse-making was [ridiculous for a variety of reasons](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-finds-new-unsettling-way-excuse-radicals-right-rcna230856), but his latest comments on the subject were every bit as unsettling.

After a reporter referenced this week’s shooting at an [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) facility in [Dallas]() and asked about political violence, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [began with predictable nonsense](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-bilat-recep-tayyip-erdogan-turkey-september-25-2025/): He said the left is “out of control”; he said [Rep.](https;//www.house.gov/) [Jasmine Crockett (D-TX30)](https://crockett.house.gov/) has a “low IQ”; etc.

But then he went a bit further:

> *It’s gonna get worse, and ultimately it’s going to go back on them. I mean bad things happen when they play these games. And, uh, I’ll give you a little clue: The right is a lot tougher than the left. But the right’s not doing this, they’re not doing it. And [the left] better not get [the right] energized, because it won’t be good for the left.*

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) concluded that “it’ll be a point where other people won’t take it anymore, and that will not be good for the radical left.”

In other words, the sitting American [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), who ostensibly represents the whole country, and who famously told [Proud Boys radicals](https://www.proudboysusa.com/) to “[stand back and stand by](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/debate-trump-sends-dangerous-signal-right-wing-extremists-n1241552)” in 2020, warned one side of the political divide not to provoke the other side — because those aligned with him are “tougher.”

[Brendan Nyhan](https://faculty-directory.dartmouth.edu/brendan-nyhan), a political scientist at [Dartmouth College](https://home.dartmouth.edu/dartmouth), [noted soon after](https://bsky.app/profile/brendannyhan.bsky.social/post/3lzokrt3wus26), “Nothing to worry about, just the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) openly threatening the left with extrajudicial violence from his allies.”

An [Axios report](https://www.axios.com/2025/09/25/trump-warns-democrats-dallas-ice-shooting) added that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s comments “risk inflaming already high tensions.” By all appearances, the Republican didn’t care.
