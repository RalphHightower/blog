## [Vance claims Trump was kidding about ‘hating’ his political enemies (but he wasn’t)](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/vance-claims-trump-was-kidding-hating-political-enemies-wasnt-rcna233636)

*After the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) said he “hates” his political opposition, the [vice president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) said he was “joking.” Recent history proves otherwise.*

Sept. 25, 2025, 8:55 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

At the memorial service to honor [Charlie Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/), his widow, [Erika Kirk](https://www.tpusa.com/), forgave the man who killed her husband, [telling attendees](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/21/us/elections/trump-charlie-kirk-memorial-service.html), “The answer to hate is not hate.”

Soon after, [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) addressed the same audience and emphasized a related point, insisting that the slain conservative activist “didn’t hate his opponents.” At that point, however, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) apparently thought it’d be a good idea to reject the underlying principle.

“That’s where I disagreed with [Charlie](https:/www.charliekirk.com/),” [Trump said](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-speech-charlie-kirk-memorial-service-rcna233000). “I hate my opponent, and I don’t want the best for them. I’m sorry. I am sorry, [Erika](https://www.tpusa.com/).”

Three days later, [JD Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) pitched the idea that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) didn’t fully mean what the world heard him say. [HuffPost reported](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/vance-trump-charlie-kirk-service-hating-enemies_n_68d45943e4b01e99f72d534f?origin=home-whats-happening-unit):

> *[Vice President JD Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/), a friend of slain right-wing activist [Charlie Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/), has claimed that [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was ‘joking’ when he ranted about hating his opponents during Kirk’s memorial.*

“Well, I think the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) was joking,” the [vice president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) told [Nexstar](https://www.nexstar.tv/)’s [Reshad Hudson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reshad-hudson-56265164/), adding, “I think it’s interesting, if you go back and watch the full speech, what the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) was trying to do, in this very humorous and very unique way, was highlight how hard it is for us to forgive our enemies.”

Ah, I see. People heard [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s comments, but they didn’t pick up on the subtleties of the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s sly comedic stylings. He’s quite the jokester, though many of us apparently fail to appreciate the nuances of his sophisticated and “very humorous” witticisms.

Or, alternatively, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wasn’t kidding.

I won’t pretend to be able to read the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s mind, but if he was kidding on Sunday about his hatred for his political foes, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is clearly committed to the bit.

In July, after whining about congressional [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) voting against the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/)’s domestic policy megabill, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [told an Iowa audience](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-says-hates-democrats-s-echoing-authoritarians-rcna217177?icid=previouspost_bot) audience, “They wouldn’t vote only because they hate [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), but I hate them, too, you know? I really do. I hate them. I cannot stand them.” There was nothing about [his tone or delivery](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-says-hates-democrats-s-echoing-authoritarians-rcna217177?icid=previouspost_bot) that suggested this was an attempt at humor.

Two weeks later, at a [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) Faith Office
 luncheon, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) went even further, condemning [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) as “[evil people](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/hating-democrats-apparently-wasnt-enough-trump-says-political-foes-are-rcna219622).”

All of this dovetailed with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) telling Americans that his political opponents are “[fascists](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-unsettling-focus-enemy-matters-rcna156028),” who are also guilty of “[treason](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-treason-obama-russia-gabbard-rcna221140).” His domestic foes, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has added, are also “[enemies of the people](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-certain-hes-identified-the-enemy-the-people-msna1130516),” “[the enemy within](https://x.com/MeidasTouch/status/1967995734449610918)” and “[threats to democracy](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-frequent-use-vance-denounces-fascist-accusations-rcna171468).”

It was against this backdrop that, at the memorial service, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) appeared to speak candidly, declaring that he “hates” his political opposition and doesn’t want what’s best for them.

I understand why [Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) peddled an obviously absurd line about the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) “joking.” In the American tradition, elected leaders have never voiced public “hatred” for those who dare to disagree with them. His repeated references to his contempt for other Americans are reminders that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) apparently sees himself as the head of “Red America,” not the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) of the whole country.

And despite the [vice president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/)’s woeful attempt at spin, there’s nothing funny about this.
