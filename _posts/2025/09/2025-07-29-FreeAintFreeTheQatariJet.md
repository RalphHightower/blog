## [Administration faces awkward questions about how to pay for Trump’s ‘free’ jet from Qatar](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/administration-faces-awkward-questions-pay-trumps-free-jet-qatar-rcna221787)

*“The more we learn about this deal, the more disturbing it becomes,” one key [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) said of the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)'s gambit.*

July 29, 2025, 2:11 PM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

When the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) [formally accepted](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-admin-accepts-jet-qatar-ignoring-legal-restrictions-bipartisan-p-rcna208306) a superluxury [Boeing](https://www.boeing.com/) [747-8 jumbo jet](https://www.boeing.com/commercial/747-8) from the [royal family of Qatar](), there was [a long line of questions](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-admin-accepts-jet-qatar-ignoring-legal-restrictions-bipartisan-p-rcna208306) about the arrangement, including ones about why [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) was involved in approving the process, despite her previous work as [a paid registered lobbyist for the Qatari government](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-qatar-jet-pam-bondi-conflict-rcna206997).

But at the top of the list a financial line of inquiry: Where will [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his team [find the money to pay for](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/problems-trumps-free-luxury-jet-qatar-s-not-actually-free-rcna206706) this?

To hear the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) tell it, there’s no need to worry, because the price tag is \$0. In mid-May, for example, the Republican [argued online](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114492082555622686) that the jet would be “FREE OF CHARGE.” He returned to the point a few days later, [asking why](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114503203859060399) taxpayers should be “forced to pay hundreds of millions of Dollars” for a plane “when they can get it for FREE” from Qatar.

The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [added soon after](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/us/politics/trump-qatar-plane-jet.html) that only “a stupid person [would] say, ‘No, we don’t want a free, very expensive](airplane.’”)

Even if the luxury jet were free, this arrangement would still be a legal, ethical and political mess. But there’s a related problem: The “free” plane [isn’t free at all](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/problems-trumps-free-luxury-jet-qatar-s-not-actually-free-rcna206706) — with projected costs of [roughly \$1 billion](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/turning-qatari-747-air-force-one-cost-1-billion-take-years-experts-say-rcna206582).

And where, pray tell, do [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his team plan to find that money? [The New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/27/us/politics/air-force-one-trump-cost.html) that [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) officials are going out of their way to “hide the cost” of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s pet project, but an answer to the underlying question is apparently coming into focus:

[The [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s inventive techniques to obscure the cost] may explain why no one wants to discuss a mysterious, \$934 million transfer of funds from one of the [Pentagon](https://www.defense.gov/)’s most over-budget, out-of-control projects — the modernization of America’s aging, ground-based nuclear missiles. In recent weeks, congressional budget sleuths have come to think that amount, slipped into an obscure [Pentagon](https://www.defense.gov/) document sent to Capitol Hill as a ‘transfer’ to an unnamed classified project, almost certainly includes the renovation of the new, gold-adorned [Air Force One]() that [Mr. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) desperately wants in the air before his term is over.

[The Times](https://www.nytimes.com/)’ report hasn’t been independently verified by [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) or [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/). That said, [Air Force](https://www.af.mil/) officials have acknowledged “dipping into nuclear modernization funds for the complex project," according to the [Times](https://www.nytimes.com/).

Once the effort is complete, the not-at-all-free jet will apparently head to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s future [presidential library](http://www.trumplibrary.gov/)) — reinforcing impressions that this is less a “gift” to the United States, and more a present for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).

And where, pray tell, do [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his team plan to find that money? [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) reported that [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) officials are going out of their way to “hide the cost” of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s pet project, but an answer to the underlying question is apparently coming into focus:

Complicating matters, if the [Times](https://www.nytimes.com/)’ reporting is correct, and the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) is shifting funds away from nuclear modernization initiatives, that poses a related set of concerns, because the physical condition of old silos — the ones holding nuclear missiles — [leaking, crumbling and falling into disrepair](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/trump-skims-nuclear-safety-funds-to-spruce-up-vanity-gift-plane-from-qatar-report-243983941775).

“The more we learn about this deal, the more disturbing it becomes,” [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH)](https://www.shaheen.senate.gov/) said. The [New Hampshire](https://www.nh.gov/) [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/), who serves on the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Armed Services Committee](http://www.armed-services.senate.gov/), added that one of her principal concerns is that “this [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) is diverting funds from the nuclear modernization budget to finance costly renovations to this plane.”

I don’t imagine we’ve heard the last of this one.
