## [How Marjorie Taylor Greene could help Epstein's survivors get closer to justice](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/marjorie-taylor-greene-epstein-clients-trump-birthday-note-rcna229886)

*The [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/)'s "speech and debate" clause is a powerful shield for members of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/).*

Sept. 9, 2025, 6:00 AM EDT
By Ray Brescia, professor of law, Albany Law School

The push for the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) to [release its files related to the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/doj-reportedly-told-trump-may-name-epstein-files-rcna220630) shows no signs of dissipating. On Monday, [Democrats on the House Oversight Committee posted an image](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/epstein-birthday-book-trump-drawing-house-oversight-rcna229846) of [a birthday note](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-threatens-wsj-new-epstein-report-picture-claim-looks-sketchy-rcna219545) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) allegedly [sent Epstein in 2003](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/epstein-trump-wall-street-journal-letter-rcna219501) ([MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) has not independently verified the note). Most [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) lawmakers are defending — or at least avoiding criticizing — the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) amid the Epstein “hoax,” as [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [continues to call it](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-trump-again-calls-epstein-case-a-hoax-as-survivors-demand-accountability). Yet one of his most ardent supporters, [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA14)](https://greene.house.gov/), has said [she will side with the survivors](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/jeffrey-epstein-files-release-status-congress-bill-victims-trump-rcna229102) of Epstein’s sex trafficking operation. And [Greene](https://greene.house.gov/) can use one of the most powerful tools of her office to aid them.

With calls to release the files from across the political spectrum growing louder and louder, the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) and [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s in [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) have largely run interference for the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). They’ve professed a commitment to justice for the survivors, but blocked any efforts at meaningful transparency. In July, [Speaker](https://speaker.house.gov/) [Mike Johnson (T-LA4)](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) sent the [House](https://www.house.gov/) home early for its summer recess to prevent more votes on proposals to require the [Justice Department](https://www.house.gov/) to release the Epstein files.

> *If Epstein’s victims also name names, they could quickly find themselves defendants in defamation suits, too.*

With the [House](https://www.justice.gov/) back in session, [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)ic [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Ro Khanna (D-CA17)](https://khanna.house.gov/) and [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Thomas Massie (T-KY4)](https://massie.house.gov/) are gathering signatures for a [“discharge petition”](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-calls-epstein-files-irrelevant-push-release-gains/story?id=125225706) that would enable the resolution to come up for a vote, and they are close to [securing the number of signatures necessary for it to pass in the House.](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5487779-epstein-discharge-petition-incoming-democrats/). Though the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) said that supporting this effort would be [deemed a “hostile act,”](https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/03/politics/transparency-epstein-trump-[administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)) [several [Republicans, including Greene, have signed the petition.](https://www.newsweek.com/jeffrey-epstein-files-republicans-2123569), have signed the petition.

In the face of this stonewalling and threats, the survivors are speaking up more than ever. At a news conference held by dozens of survivors last week, survivor Lisa Phillips said they would be [compiling the so-called Epstein client list](https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/national-international/trump-[administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)-immigration-epstein-congress-september-3-2025-live-updates/3983272/). But, [she added](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/epstein-survivors-list/), “We’re not quite sure, you know, how we’re going to release that or even if we’re going to.” That caution reflects the fact that sharing a list with the public could prove hazardous for the survivors. They already face [threats and intimidation](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/06/epstein-files-rape-crime-trump) and releasing a client list carries the risk of [legal action against them](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/09/03/house-epstein-files-victims-news-conference/), including claims of defamation.

For instance, in 2019 Virginia Giuffre sued attorney Alan Dershowitz for defamation, [alleging](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/alan-dershowitz-sued-defamation-connected-epstein-sex-abuse-claims-n995271) that he was “one of the men to whom Epstein lent out [Giuffre] for sex” and that he falsely claimed Giuffre made up allegations about him and Epstein. Dershowitz denied the accusations and countersued Giuffre for defamation. In 2022, both sides dropped their lawsuits, with Giuffre acknowledging that it might have been [a case of mistaken identity](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/epstein-victim-drops-lawsuit-lawyer-alan-dershowitz-rcna56250). (Giuffre tragically [took her own life](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/26/g-s1-62856/virginia-giuffre-has-died#:~:text=Virginia%20Giuffre%2C%20who%20accused%20Britain's,Western%20Australia%2C%20her%20publicist%20confirmed.) earlier this year.)

If Epstein’s victims also name names, they could quickly find themselves defendants in defamation suits, too. That’s where [Greene](https://greene.house.gov/) — and the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/) — come in.

Thanks to the [“speech and debate” clause](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-1/section-6/clause-1/speech-and-debate-privilege) clause in the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/), members of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) have immunity for statements and acts carried out as part of their official duties, especially when they make statements within the legislative chambers or pursuant to their legitimate legislative powers.

That immunity for members of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) may help shield them from [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s wrath is somewhat ironic.

This immunity is [not without limits](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1971/71-1017), but since 1880, the [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) [has interpreted](https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep103/usrep103168/usrep103168.pdf) the speech and debate clause broadly, immunizing members of the [House](https://www.house.gov/) and [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) for a wide range of official acts. [By the express terms of the Constitution](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-1/section-6/clause-1/speech-and-debate-privilege), when a federal legislator carries out their official duties, “they shall not be questioned in any other Place” for their actions. That means that, at a minimum, when their actions are covered by this clause, and a statement on the House floor related to [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/)’ efforts to investigate the Epstein matter certainly would qualify, [they cannot be sued for defamation](https://www.loc.gov/item/usrep443111/).

That immunity allows [Greene](https://greene.house.gov/) to say, as she did last week, that if the survivors “want to give me a list, I will walk in that Capitol on the [House](https://www.house.gov/) floor and I’ll say every damn name that abused these women. I can do that for them, and I’d be proud to do it.” Unlike the victims who might speak out, then, [Greene](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-epstein-files-clients-name-b2819459.html), [Massie](https://x.com/RepThomasMassie/status/1963385897984168364) and any federal legislator who wants to communicate the testimony of the victims would be completely immune from claims of defamation for their statements.

[Greene](https://greene.house.gov/) or any other member of the [House](https://www.house.gov/) or [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) could also go on the floor of either chamber and read out the statements and testimony of Epstein’s alleged victims without fear of any legal consequences. And the political consequences, for the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and those who are trying to fight transparency with respect to the lingering Epstein scandal, could be profound.

The fact that immunity for members of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) may help shield them from [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s wrath is somewhat ironic. Just last year the [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) [gave the office he now holds](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) broad immunity, apparently even to commit criminal acts. But as members of his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) threaten [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s who're helping to bring justice to the survivors, they should remember that the members of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) have their own immunity as well.
