title: "The Canonization of Charlie Kirk"
---

1. Flags at half-staff on federal buildings, [military bases](https://www.jcs.mil/), [Navy](https://www.navy.mil/) at sea?
2. [JD Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) flying on [Air Force Two](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/) to pick up [Charlie Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/)'s casket?
3. [Presidential Medal of Freedom / Congress.gov / Library of Congress](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R47639)?

One would think that that a president had died.

[Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) never served:

- as public office
- in the [military](https://www.jcs.mil/)
- as a first responder

## [Charlie Kirk’s casket to be flown on Air Force Two, the vice president’s plane](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/charlie-kirk-casket-air-force-two-vance-plane-rcna230695)

*The plane reserved for [Vice President JD Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) was set to carry the body of his close friend from [Utah](https://www.utah.gov/) to [Phoenix](https://www.phoenix.gov/) on Thursday.*

Conservative influencer [Charlie Kirk](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/charlie-kirk-killed-shooting-utah-political-violence-rcna230487)’s body will be flown Thursday from [Utah](https://www.utah.gov/) to [Phoenix](https://www.phoenix.gov/) on [Air Force Two](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/), the airplane reserved for the [vice president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), sources familiar with the plans confirmed to [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) [and NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/live-blog/charlie-kirk-shot-dead-assassination-shooter-manhunt-live-updates-rcna230536/rcrd88198?canonicalCard=true).

[Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) [fatally shot](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/charlie-kirk-shot-utah-turning-point-usa-rcna230441?icid=latestpost_bot) Wednesday during an event at [Utah Valley University
](https://www.uvu.edu/) in [Orem](https://orem.gov/). The headquarters of [Turning Point USA](https://www.tpusa.com/), the nonprofit organization co-founded by [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) in 2012, is located in [Phoenix](https://www.phoenix.gov/), where [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) lived.

[Vice President JD Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/), a longtime friend of [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/)’s, and second lady [Usha Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/usha-vance/) were originally scheduled to be in [New York City](https://www.nyc.gov/) for a 9/11 memorial ceremony on Thursday, but instead traveled to [Salt Lake City](https://www.slc.gov/) to meet with [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/)’s family and friends.

[Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) shared a [lengthy tribute](https://x.com/JDVance/status/1965985360606888182) to his late friend on [X](https://x.com/), that read in part, “[Charlie Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) was a true friend. The kind of guy you could say something to and know it would always stay with him. I am on more than a few group chats with [Charlie](https://www.charliekirk.com/) and people he introduced me to over the years. We celebrate weddings and babies, bust each other’s chops, and mourn the loss of loved ones.”

[Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) said he met [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) around 2017 after [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) sent him a direct message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/), now [X](https://x.com/), and the two maintained a close friendship ever since. [Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) also credited [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) with helping [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) win the 2024 election and “staff the entire government.”

[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said Thursday that he will posthumously award [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) the [Presidential Medal of Freedom](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R47639).
