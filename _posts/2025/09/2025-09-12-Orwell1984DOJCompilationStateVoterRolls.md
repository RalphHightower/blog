title: "Trump Is Unlawfully Compiling an Orwellian Database by Grabbing States Voter Rolls"
---

Nineteen Eighty-Four (also published as 1984) is a dystopian novel by the English writer George Orwell. It was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final completed book. Thematically, it centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass surveillance and repressive regimentation of people and behaviours within society. Orwell, a democratic socialist and an anti-Stalinist, modelled an authoritarian socialist Britain on the Soviet Union in the era of Stalinism and the practices of state censorship and state propaganda in Nazi Germany. More broadly, the novel examines the role of truth and facts within societies and the ways in which they can be manipulated.

## 1984 Super Bowl APPLE MACINTOSH Ad by Ridley Scott

During Superbowl XVIII Apple ran their "1984" Super Bowl Commercial directed by Ridley Scott, starring Anya Major & David Graham, & conceived by Steve Hayden, Brent Thomas & Lee Clow. It's a classic ad that some might say is more relevant in 2023 than ever. Here I have upscaled it using https://www.topazlabs.com/topaz-video... from various sources including ‪@JasonFoxLCB‬'s excellent recreation, Ridley Scott's archives, & other versions on something called YouTube.

## [Trump's DOJ is reportedly assembling an unprecedented national voter database](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-doj-national-voter-database-non-citizens-rcna230393)

*[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) could potentially use the information to attempt to sow doubt about elections.*

Sept. 11, 2025, 5:26 PM EDT
By [Zeeshan Aleem](https://www.msnbc.com/author/zeeshan-aleem-ncpn1235332)

The [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) is reportedly putting together a gigantic and unprecedented data base of national voter information — and it could help [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s efforts [to deny the 2020 election results or cast doubt on future elections.](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/election-2024-fraud-rumors-pennsylvania-trump-harris-rcna178710).

> *Plenty of studies indicate that noncitizen voting is so vanishingly rare that it poses no threat to election integrity.*

[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/), citing people familiar with the matter, [reports](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/09/us/politics/trump-voter-registration-data.html) that the “[Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) is compiling the largest set of national voter roll data it has ever collected, buttressing an effort by [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his supporters to try to prove long-running, unsubstantiated claims that droves of undocumented immigrants have voted illegally.” [The Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) reports that the initiative has proceeded through efforts at both the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/)’s civil rights division and criminal division, “seeking data about individual voters across the country, including names and addresses, in a move that experts say may violate the law.”

Plenty of studies indicate that noncitizen voting is [so vanishingly](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/12/nx-s1-5147789/voting-election-2024-noncitizen-fact-check-trump) rare that it [poses no threat](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/blog/myths-about-noncitizen-voting-heritage-foundation-data/) to election integrity. For example, after the [2016 elections](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf), [the Brennan Center for Justice](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/12/nx-s1-5147789/voting-election-2024-noncitizen-fact-check-trump) surveyed election officials in 42 jurisdictions with high immigration populations and found a suspected noncitizen voting rate of 0.0001%.

[Justin Levitt](https://www.lls.edu/faculty/justinlevitt/), a former [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) official who’s an election law expert at [Loyola Marymount University](https://www.lmu.edu/)’s [law school](https://www.lls.edu/), likens [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/)’s efforts to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) deploying the [National Guard](https://www.nationalguard.mil/) to handle domestic law enforcement. He told the [Times](https://www.nytimes.com/), “It’s wading in, without authorization and against the law, with an overly heavy federal hand to take over a function that states are actually doing just fine.” He described the reported effort as “wildly illegal” and “deeply troubling” and said “nobody asked for this.”

In what appears to be a related effort to ostensibly identify noncitizen voting, [NPR reports](https://www.npr.org/2025/09/10/nx-s1-5477367/save-election-citizenship-data-trump) that election officials have checked the citizenship status and other information of more than 33 million voters through the [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services](http://www.uscis.gov/)’s [Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE)](https://www.uscis.gov/save) Program.

[Sean Morales-Doyle](https://www.brennancenter.org/about/leadership/sean-morales-doyle), director of the voting rights and elections program at the [Brennan Center for Justice](https://www.brennancenter.org/) at [NYU](https://www.nyu.edu/) [Law](https://www.law.nyu.edu/), expressed concerns about the [SAVE](https://www.uscis.gov/save) searches in an email to [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/):

> *It is possible someone could manipulate or misinterpret the results of [SAVE](https://www.uscis.gov/save) searches to peddle disinformation about voter fraud and undermine faith in our elections. It is also possible that the data could be misused. There is a reason we have a [Privacy Act](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R47863), which places requirements on the federal government before it amasses private personal data on American citizens. Recent reporting on errors by [DOGE](https://doge.gov/) indicate the danger of that personal information getting into the wrong hands or being misused.*

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), of course, doesn’t hew to the truth when he denies election results. But armed with more information, his efforts to cast doubt on election results or manufacture narratives about massive noncitizen voting could become more sophisticated.
