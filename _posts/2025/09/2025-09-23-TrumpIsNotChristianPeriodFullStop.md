title: "Trump Is Not a Christian. Period. Full Stop!"
---

[Donnie](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is not a Christian. The only time that Trump has been spotted in a church has been his inauguration, [President Jimmy Carter](https://www.jimmycarterlibrary.gov/)'s service, and [Pope Francis](https://www.vatican.va/content/vatican/en/holy-father/francesco.html) service. Sundays or whatever sabbath he claims, he will be playing golf at one of his golf courses. 

## [Trump used Charlie Kirk’s memorial to alienate many Americans he swore to serve](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-speech-charlie-kirk-memorial-service-rcna233000)

*[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s admission that he hates his opponents calls into question the Christianity he professes but, as importantly, it shows he doesn't believe he’s everybody’s [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).*

Sept. 22, 2025, 6:43 PM EDT
By Jarvis DeBerry, MSNBC Opinion Editor

When [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) addressed the tens of thousands of people [at the State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/charlie-kirk-funeral-conservative-revival-rcna232823), gathered on Sunday to commemorate [Charlie Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/), [who was shot dead Sept. 10 while speaking at Utah Valley University](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/charlie-kirk-killed-shooting-utah-political-violence-rcna230487), he described the 31-year-old founder of [Turning Point USA](https://www.tpusa.com/) as “a missionary with a noble spirit and a great, great purpose. He didn’t hate his opponents.”

> *I hate my opponent, and I don’t want the best for them. I’m sorry.* </></>[PRESIDENT](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [DONALD TRUMP](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)

But then, demonstrating that he can’t even allow the deceased to be the focus at his own memorial service, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) interjected: “That’s where I disagreed with [Charlie](https://www.charliekirk.com/). I hate my opponent, and I don’t want the best for them. I’m sorry. I am sorry, [Erika](https://tpusa.com/team/),” he said looking toward [Kirk](https://tpusa.com/team/)’s widow, [who at that same service said that she had forgiven her husband’s killer](https://www.nbcnews.com/now/video/erika-kirk-says-she-forgives-shooter-who-killed-her-husband-charlie-kirk-248035909830).

“But now Erika can talk to me,” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said after soaking up the laughter of the crowd, “and the whole group, and maybe they can convince me that that’s not right.” That may have been the absolute worst way to channel [Charlie Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/)'s [“Prove me wrong” challenges](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxqnkwerj7o).

The Christian implications of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s statement are damning, to say the least. Despite professing Christianity, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) rejects a direct command from Jesus himself to love one’s enemies, and doesn’t appear to feel any shame or embarrassment at admitting it.

If the words of Jesus can’t convince [a self-professed nondenominational Christian](https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2020/10/23/trump-once-presbyterian/) (who said, “[It was God that saved me](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-trump-delivers-remarks-at-the-national-prayer-breakfast-in-washington-d-c)” from being assassinated in July) that expressing hate for one’s opponents isn’t right, then why would [Erika Kirk](https://tpusa.com/team/), or anybody else, bother?

Nobody should be shocked by what [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said. There’s nothing new about [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) saying something that gives the public reason to question the sincerity of his beliefs. In 2015, [he could neither cite a favorite Bible verse](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-refused-to-name-favorite-bible-verse-2015-8) nor admit that he needed forgiveness. Because, as he put it, “Why do I have to repent or ask for forgiveness [if I am not making mistakes](https://www.christianpost.com/news/trump-why-do-i-have-to-repent-or-ask-for-forgiveness-if-i-am-not-making-mistakes-video.html)?”

[Then there was the “Two Corinthians” thing](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-tests-evangelical-message-liberty-university-n499061). While [there are some Christians](https://www.truthforlife.org/resources/sermon/solemn-fact/) and biblical scholars who do say [“Two” and not “Second”](https://www.cathedralatl.org/sermons/two-corinthians-and-the-spirit-of-the-lord/) Corinthians to refer to that epistle of Paul’s, [Trump’s verbalization of “Two Corinthians” at a speech at Liberty University in 2016](https://www.cnn.com/2016/01/20/politics/donald-trump-tony-perkins-sarah-palin) was another moment that suggested a profound unfamiliarity with the Bible. After all that, in 2020, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) held up a Bible in Washington’s Lafayette Square just after he’d had people protesting George Floyd’s murder cleared out. He seems to see the Bible as a political weapon and not as a religious text that should inform, among other things, how he talks about and treats his adversaries. Or he sees it as a moneymaker. [He began selling $60 Trump Bibles last year](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-god-bless-usa-bible-easter-rcna145288).

But even though I am a Christian, my main concern isn’t that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s remark about hating his opponents is a bold and unrepentant defiance of a command directly out of the mouth of Jesus, but that it is an equally bold declaration that he doesn’t think of himself as the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) for all Americans. Every president of the United States has opponents, but have we ever heard a [president](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) declare his hatred for them?

We’ve come to expect people who’ve been elected to run the country to commit to being everybody’s [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).

To the contrary, we’ve come to expect people who’ve been elected to run the country to commit to being everybody’s president. [George W. Bush](https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/) made that commitment when he gave his victory speech in 2000: “[Whether you voted for me or not, I will do my best to serve your interests](https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/gwbush2000victoryspeech.htm).” [Barack Obama](obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) said, “And, to those Americans whose support I have yet to earn, I may not have won your vote, but I hear your voices, I need your help, and [and I will be your president, too](https://www.npr.org/2008/11/05/96624326/transcript-of-barack-obamas-victory-speech).” [Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) said, [I will work as hard for those who didn’t vote for me — as those who did](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/read-president-elect-joe-biden-s-full-victory-speech-n1247012).” Even [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), in 2016, said, “I pledge to every citizen of our land that [I will be president for all Americans](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/blog/donald-trump-promise-tracker-2017-n1198266).”

Now, in case we hadn’t already figured it out, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wants us to know that he’s only [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) for some Americans. That’s the only conclusion we can draw — unless we accept the absurd idea that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) expects to faithfully serve Americans he hates.

Obviously, [Trump’s partiality toward his supporters was already clear](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-response-charlie-kirk-melissa-hortman-shootings-rcna230825). The most recent, glaring example, came after [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) was killed. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) had flags lowered for [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/), and [Air Force Two](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/) flew [Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/)’s body from [Utah](https://www.utah.gov/) to [Arizona](https://www.az.gov/), but [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) didn’t so much as call [Minnesota](https://www.mn.gov/) [Gov.](https://mn.gov/governor/) [Tim Walz](https://mn.gov/governor/about-gov/timwalz/) in June after [Minnesota House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, were fatally shot,](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/minnesota-shootings-lawmakers-hortman-hoffman-democrats-rcna213049), and [Minnesota](https://www.mn.gov/) state [Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, were injured](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/minnesota-shootings-lawmakers-hortman-hoffman-democrats-rcna213049).

“[“Why would I call him?” Trump said of Walz](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-says-wont-call-gov-tim-walz-minnesota-shootings-mess-rcna213432)” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said of [Walz](https://mn.gov/governor/about-gov/timwalz/) before dismissing the idea as a waste of time. A spokesperson for [Walz](https://mn.gov/governor/about-gov/timwalz/) said then that the governor “wishes that [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) would be a [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) for all Americans.”

Whether it’s deciding that some [some American victims of political violence are more deserving of compassion than others,](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-response-charlie-kirk-melissa-hortman-shootings-rcna230825) or even demanding that the attorney general [drum up charges against his opponents](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-directive-ag-bondi-seen-impeachment-level-scandal-rcna232888), every day we get more evidence that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) isn’t the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) for all Americans.

And on Sunday, we heard it directly from him that he doesn’t intend to be.
