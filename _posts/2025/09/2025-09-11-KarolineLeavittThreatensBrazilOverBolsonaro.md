*The press secretary suggested the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) could use its “military might” in response to a conviction of [Brazil](https://www.gov.br/)’s former MAGA-friendly leader.*

Sept. 10, 2025, 2:27 PM EDT
By [Ja'han Jones](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jahan-jones-ncpn371241)

Former [Brazilian](https://www.gov.br/) President Jair Bolsonaro, once known as the [“Trump of the tropics,”](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-45746013) appears to be on the verge of a conviction for his role in [a failed coup attempt launched after he lost his last election](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/south-america/brazils-supreme-court-orders-house-arrest-former-president-bolsonaro-rcna223008). And on Tuesday, [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) press secretary Karoline Leavitt appeared to threaten [Brazil](https://www.gov.br/) with “military might” if Bolsonaro should face repercussions.

Leavitt’s eyebrow-raising remarks came Tuesday at a [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) press briefing, after she was asked a meandering question related to [two Brazilian judges who voted](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/09/brazil-jair-bolsonaro-trial) to convict Bolsonaro. (The final verdict is expected Thursday, after the other members of [Brazil](https://www.gov.br/)’s five-person [Supreme Court](https://portal.stf.jus.br/) have weighed in.) Conservative content-creator Michael Shellenberger — who [tapped in 2020 by Elon Musk](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-musk-partnership-x-twitter-files-rcna180427) to push the [debunked “Twitter Files” conspiracy](https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/mehdi-hasan-matt-taibbi-twitter-files-elon-musk-rcna78732) conspiracy that alleged censorship by the U.S. government — suggested Bolsonaro’s likely conviction is related to “censorship” and asked Leavitt if the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) would respond if that prevented him from running for office in the future.

[Leavitt’s response](https://www.youtube.com/live/YCLPVwce9jc?t=649) tried to portray the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) as a bastion of free speech and touted [its tariffs against Brazil](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-brazilian-products-tariffs-bolsonaro-rcna222534) as a response to the case against Bolsonaro.

“I don’t have any additional actions to preview for today, but I can tell you this is a priority for the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) and the president is unafraid to use the economic might, the military might, of the United States to protect free speech around the world,” [she said](https://www.youtube.com/live/YCLPVwce9jc?t=649).

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is actually [waging an open assault on free speech in the United States](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/19/us-free-speech-rights-trump) (famously, part of “the world”). So Leavitt’s spin here is detached from reality. But her reference to “military might” in the context of defending an ousted authoritarian ruler is noteworthy. Not only does such a threat run counter to [the president’s campaign vow](https://time.com/7295729/trump-middle-east-war-iran-risk/) to avoid launching new wars, but it also arguably puts [Brazil](https://www.gov.br/) on notice that the U.S. may consider using force to prevent the country from holding Bolsonaro accountable.

It’s unclear whether Leavitt’s remarks here are mere bluster from a press secretary [who’s made that her calling card](https://www.poynter.org/commentary/2025/karoline-leavitt-white-house-debut-press-secretary/). I’ve reached out to the [Defense Department](https://www.defense.gov/) for clarity on its position on [Brazil](https://www.gov.br/).

Nonetheless, Leavitt’s remarks are undeniably ominous. The [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s [missile strike on a civilian boat off the coast of Venezuela](https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/-despicable-and-thoughtless-sen-paul-slams-vp-vance-over-strike-on-venezuela-drug-boat-247054405754) arguably demonstrates its willingness to use military force with South American nations that run afoul of its agenda or misalign with its politics.

And in the case of [Brazil](https://www.gov.br/), many Americans may have concerns about the prospect of the U.S. military being used just to protect one of the president’s authoritarian allies.
