@RalphHightower: Protests are legal. Trading in your [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) for a car or truck that is not toxic is legal. Vandalism, torching, gun fire, and firebombing are illegal, so don't do that.

## [Ahead of Tesla protests, Musk threatens his company’s critics](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/tesla-protests-musk-threats-critics-rcna198628)

*[Elon Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/) issued his threats on [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) ahead of planned protests, saying [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) will punish those who spread “lies and propaganda.”*

It was like something you’d expect from a villain in a comic book: The world’s richest man leering through the television screen, wagging his finger while threatening to weaponize the government — up to and including the presidency — to quash criticism of him and his company.

And yet there was [Elon Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/), during his [recent sit-down interview with Faux News host Bret Baier](https://www.foxnews.com/media/elon-musk-torches-democrats-being-real-villains-tesla-vandalism-blames-left-wing-propaganda), vowing to sic the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) and others in the federal government on critics. Ahead of a weekend when protests against him and his tech company, [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/), are scheduled in [more than 200 locations](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/mar/28/anti-elon-musk-protests-tesla), Musk accused his critics of posing a greater threat than violent vandals.

[Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/) told [Baier](https://www.foxnews.com/person/b/bret-baier):

> *They’re being fed propaganda by the far-left, and they believe it. It’s really unfortunate. The real problem is not, like, you know, the crazy guy that firebombs a [Tesla dealership](https://www.tesla.com/findus). It’s the people pushing the propaganda that caused that guy to do it. Those are the real villains here, and we’re going to go after them. And the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) has made it clear we’re going to go after them. The ones providing the money, the ones pushing the lies and propaganda, we’re going after them.*

While there have been reported incidents of vandalism targeting [Teslas](https://www.tesla.com/) and [Tesla dealerships](https://www.tesla.com/findus) in recent weeks, [there](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/elon-musk/tesla-vandalism-not-coordinated-trump-musk-claims-rcna197369)’[s no evidence](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/elon-musk/tesla-vandalism-not-coordinated-trump-musk-claims-rcna197369) those are part of some coordinated effort by liberals (or anyone else), contrary to claims from [Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/) and [Donald Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/). In [Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/)’s estimation, the vandalism seems almost beside the point; he is suggesting rather that it’s people who say negative things about [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) who are the true ne’er-do-wells.

The important context here is that [Tesla stock has](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/19/business/elon-musk-tesla-stock-nightcap/index.html) [taken a tumble to start the year](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/19/business/elon-musk-tesla-stock-nightcap/index.html) amid [massive product recalls](https://mashable.com/article/every-cybertruck-recall-full-list) and [growing anger at Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/katy-tur/watch/-striking-level-of-anger-at-musk-gop-feeling-the-heat-from-constituents-over-doge-cuts-232795717602) for giving [Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/) the ability to withhold money from federal programs that Americans rely on. A [recent NBC News poll found](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/doge/poll-voters-idea-doge-elon-musk-early-results-raise-red-flags-rcna196541) that 51 percent of registered voters hold a negative view of [Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/), compared to 39 percent who view him positively. ([Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/) himself saw this coming [last year](https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/elon-musk-trump-hardship-austerity-taxes-rcna177732) [when he predicted](https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/elon-musk-trump-hardship-austerity-taxes-rcna177732) that his and [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/)’s decisions would create “hardship” that could lead to anger toward him.)

When [Baier](https://www.foxnews.com/person/b/bret-baier) noted that some have accused [Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/) of being “a Nazi, a white supremacist [and] a fascist,” [Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/) again said that opinions of that sort warrant punishment. “We need to hold people responsible for pushing these lies, because those lies almost got the president killed.”

Of course, there’s no evidence that any such accusations against [Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/) — even if one were citing his [support for Germany’s far-right AfD](https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/elon-musk-afd-party-german-election-officials-rcna185784) party or [his repeated promotion of racist pseudoscience](https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-sick-immigrants-musk-pseudoscience-rcna146301) — have anything to do with any previous attempts on [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/)’s life. 

But this is oligarchy in action: a rich man lording over the government that [has](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2025/elon-musk-business-government-contracts-funding/) [already](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2025/elon-musk-business-government-contracts-funding/) [paid him handsomely](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2025/elon-musk-business-government-contracts-funding/), using the [apparatus of the state](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) as a [weapon in an attempt to silence critics](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-the-weaponization-of-the-federal-government/).
