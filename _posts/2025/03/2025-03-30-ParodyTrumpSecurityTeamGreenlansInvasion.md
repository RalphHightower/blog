## [Opinion / Trump national security team’s leaked plans to invade Greenland - The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/03/25/hegseth-waltz-leaked-text-houthi-satire/)

*Michael Waltz renamed the conversation “Greenland PC small group SECRET.”*

March 25, 2025

_National security adviser Michael Waltz opened a conversation.

Michael Waltz invited Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Vice President JD Vance, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles and presidential adviser Stephen Miller.

Michael Waltz named the conversation “Greenland PC small group.”

Michael Waltz renamed the conversation “Greenland PC small group SECRET.”_

**Pete Hegseth**: lol

**Michael Waltz**: Team — establishing a principles group to 1st apologize for the mess w/the Houthi chat. Pls accept that that was on me and won’t happen again

**Scott Bessent**: We’ve all been there

**Marco Rubio**: have we?

**Michael Waltz**: Thankfully that was for a relatively small operation few Americans care abt. This next one though, big. So before we proceed, can everybody in the chat just sound off with your names pls?

**JD Vance**: JD here

**Tulsi Gabbard**: tulsi

**Scott Bessent**: Scott

**Marco Rubio**: marco

**John Ratcliffe**: JRat

**Pete Hegseth**: washington post

**Pete Hegseth**: jk pete 🤪

**Susie Wiles**: 👋 ~~Susie Wiles

**Stephen Miller**: [The brightness on everyone’s screen suddenly diminishes by 20 percent.]

**Michael Waltz**: Great, thanks. Just to make sure, everybody is in a SCIF, right?

**John Ratcliffe**: Yes

_[Vance, Gabbard, Bessent, Miller and Wiles thumbs-up Ratcliffe’s message. The chat shows that Hegseth has begun typing. He stops typing. He begins typing again. He stops typing.]_

**Pete Hegseth**: yes

**Michael Waltz:** … ok. So. Greenland. Pete, can you update us?

**Pete Hegseth**: Transports assembled off Maine coast & ready to get underway to have tanks into Nuuk by 0630 tomorrow. Expect a quick surrender.

**JD Vance**: Ok. Spoke w/POTUS this morning, who is all on board. He is still settling on a name post-annexation, but I think we need to brace for something McKinley-related. State — we are still good on Europe?

**Marco Rubio**: Yes, expecting condemnation but no military action and severed relationship with greenland

**Pete Hegseth**: ok are we ready for a go/no-go?

**Tulsi Gabbard**: go

**Susie Wiles**: go ~~Susie Wiles

**John Ratcliffe**: Go

**Michael Waltz**: 👊🇺🇸🔥

**Marco Rubio**: ?

**Michael Waltz**: Sry, that’s a go

**Scott Bessent**: Go

**Stephen Miller**: go

**JD Vance**: I think we’re making a mistake here. A nonmilitary free-association agreement with Greenland would be so much more efficient and less costly. Even a limited minerals deal would secure the vast majority of the benefits we’re looking to extract without the many, many downsides of forcible annexation. I am not sure the president is even aware of the effects of the Mercator projection. And who knows whether his wishes will change within 24 hours? This plan just happens to be his desire right now.

**Michael Waltz**: ... is that a go?

**JD Vance**: Oh my god, yes, go, was that not clear?

Pete Hegseth added Mute Egede to the conversation.

**Marco Rubio**: ???

**Susie Wiles**: who is Mute Egede ?? ~~Susie Wiles

**Tulsi Gabbard**: treasury i think

**Scott Bessent**: Susie, you have a signature set to appear with messages. lmk and I can show you how to take that off

**Susie Wiles**: thx scott ~~Susie Wiles

**Marco Rubio**: !! Mute Egede is the prime minister of Greenland !!

Marco Rubio removed Mute Egede from the conversation.

[The conversation is silent for four minutes.]

**Tulsi Gabbard**: … do you think he saw?

**Marco Rubio**: Pete what the hell!

**Pete Hegseth**: sorry!! sry i was picking up my dry cleaning and the chat kept dinging and i was trying to explain that there was a stain on my shirt that wasn’t there before and that they needed to take it back and I said siri “mute the thread” but i think siri heard “mute egede” ??

**Marco Rubio**: you called the go/no-go!

**Michael Waltz**: u said you were in a SCIF!

**Pete Hegseth**: … it’s a big SCIF 😅

**Susie Wiles**: 👎

**Susie Wiles**: i think i got it, thx scott

**Pete Hegseth**: is it too late to vote go?

**Tulsi Gabbard**: hold, I’m seeing that Egede is hosting an emergency press conference

**Scott Bessent**: watching

**Marco Rubio**: same — waittttt

**John Ratcliffe**: no way

**Pete Hegseth**: what is it i’m grabbing sushi now??

**Michael Waltz**: He’s saying that Greenland has been targeted in a disinformation campaign to suggest an imminent U.S. invasion. That while the incompetence required to reveal military plans via leaked group chat one time already strains credulity, to do so two days in a row is certainly impossible. That such an operation can be meant only to undermine U.S.-Greenlandic trust, an outcome he refuses to let occur.

**Marco Rubio**: so …

**Pete Hegseth**: so … we go

**Michael Waltz**: so … you’re welcome :)
