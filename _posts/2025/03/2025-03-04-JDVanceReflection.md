excerpt: “There is this crazy idea in the Democratic Party that if you just repeat insane ideas, eventually the American people are going to believe them. We actually think the American people are smart and we should listen to them rather than preach at them and I think that’s the core right now of the president’s political strength.” Vance Vice President"

Story by Lee Moran. March 4, 2025

[JD Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) sparked eye-rolls and caused irony meters to overload with his latest ― spectacularly unaware ― attack on Democrats.

[Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) said during an interview with [Faux News’](https://www.foxnews.com/) Sean Hannity that aired Monday:

- “There is this crazy idea in the [Democratic Party](https://www.democrats.org/) that if you just repeat insane ideas, eventually the American people are going to believe them. We actually think the American people are smart and we should listen to them rather than preach at them and I think that’s the core right now of the president’s political strength. These ideas will destroy western civilization”

Critics on social media immediately accused [Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) of projection.

They suggested the repetition of wild ideas ― and the preaching to voters ― were tactics deployed by [President Donald Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/), [Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) himself and the rest of the [Trump Party](https://www.gop com/).

“Isn’t that [Trump’s](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) whole business model?” asked one commenter.

Another said: “Every accusation is a confession.”

[Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/): There is this crazy idea in the [Democratic Party](https://www.democrats.org/) that if you just repeat insane ideas, eventually the American people are going to believe them.
