## [‚ÄòPeople Are Scared‚Äô: Inside CISA as It Reels From Trump‚Äôs Purge / WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/inside-cisa-under-trump/)

By Eric Geller
Security Mar 13, 2025 5:30 AM

Mass layoffs and weak leadership are severely impacting the [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)](https://www.cisa.gov/), undermining its ability to protect the U.S. from foreign adversaries and ransomware gangs.

‚ÄúYou've got a lot of people who ‚Ä¶ are looking over their shoulder as opposed to looking at the enemy right now,‚Äù says one [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/) employee.

Suzanne Spaulding, who led [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/)‚Äôs predecessor during the [Obama administration](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov):
- ‚ÄúOur enemies are not slowig their continuous assaults on our systems. We need all hands on deck and focused, not traumatized and distracted.‚Äù

### Talent Exodus

[CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/)‚Äôs mission has grown significantly since its creation in 2018. Established mainly to defend government networks, the agency increasingly embraced new roles supporting private companies and state governments, advocating for secure software, and cooperating with foreign partners. This helped [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/) raise its profile and gain credibility. But now, following several rounds of layoffs and new restrictions from the Trump administration, the agency is struggling to sustain its momentum.

[CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/) has lost between 300 and 400 staffers, roughly 10% of its workforce, due to layoffs and the [Office of Personnel Management‚Äôs](https://www.opm.gov/) deferred-resignation program. This has resulted in a critical skills shortage and increased workload for remaining employees.

Many of those people were hired through [DHS‚Äôs](https://www.dhs.gov/) Cybersecurity Talent Management System (CTMS), a program designed to recruit experts by competing with private-sector salaries. As a result, they were classified as probationary employees for three years, making them vulnerable to layoffs. These layoffs at [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/) also hit longtime government workers who had become probationary by transferring into CTMS roles.

### Partnership Problems

[CISA's](https://www.cisa.gov/) external partnerships have been strained, with international travel frozen and communications with foreign partners requiring high-level approvals. Companies have expressed concerns about sharing information with [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/) due to the [Department of Government Efficiency‚Äôs (DOGE)](https://www.doge.gov/) actions.

### Gutting Security Advocacy

[CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/)‚Äôs efforts to help the tech industry with open-source software security and artificial intelligence have been hindered by the loss of key employees and the freezing of related programs. The agency‚Äôs work on AI security has been severely limited.

[CISA's](https://www.cisa.gov/) external partnerships‚Äîthe cornerstone of its effort to understand and counter evolving threats‚Äîhave been especially hard-hit.

International travel has been frozen, two employees say, with trips‚Äîand even online communications with foreign partners‚Äîrequiring high-level approvals. That has hampered [CISA's](https://www.cisa.gov/) collaboration with other cyber agencies, including those of ‚ÄúFive Eyes‚Äù allies [Canada](https://www.canada.ca/), [Australia](https://www.pm.gov.au/), [New Zealand](https://www.govt.nz/), and the [UK](https://www.gov.uk/), staffers say.

[CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/) employees can‚Äôt even communicate with people at other federal agencies the way they used to. Previously routine conversations between [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/) staffers and high-level officials elsewhere now need special permissions, slowing down important work. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt reach out to a CISO about an emergency situation without approval,‚Äù a fourth employee says.

Meanwhile, companies have expressed fears about sharing information with [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/) and even using the agency‚Äôs free attack-monitoring services due to [DOGE‚Äôs](https://www.doge.gov/) ransacking of agency computers, according to two employees. ‚ÄúThere is advanced concern about all of our services that collect sensitive data,‚Äù the third employee says. ‚ÄúPartners [are] asking questions about what [DOGE](https://www.doge.gov/) can get access to and expressing concern that their sensitive information is in their hands.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe wrecking of preestablished relationships will be something that will have long-lasting effects,‚Äù the fourth employee says.

[CISA's](https://www.cisa.gov/) [Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/partnerships-and-collaboration/joint-cyber-defense-collaborative), a high-profile hub of government-industry cooperation, is also struggling. The [JCDC](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/partnerships-and-collaboration/joint-cyber-defense-collaborative) currently works with more than 300 private companies to exchange threat information, draft defensive playbooks, discuss geopolitical challenges, and publish advisories. The unit wants to add hundreds more partners, but it has ‚Äúhad difficulty scaling this,‚Äù the first employee says, and recent layoffs have only made things worse. Contractors might be able to help, but the [JCDC‚Äôs](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/partnerships-and-collaboration/joint-cyber-defense-collaborative) ‚Äúvendor support contracts run out in less than a year,‚Äù the employee says, and as processes across the government have been frozen or paused in recent weeks, [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/) doesn‚Äôt know if it can pursue new agreements. The [JCDC](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/partnerships-and-collaboration/joint-cyber-defense-collaborative) doesn't have enough federal workers to pick up the slack, the fourth [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/) employee says.

### ‚ÄòNefarious‚Äô Retribution

[CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/) staffers are still reeling from the agency‚Äôs suspension of its election security program and the layoffs of most people who worked on that mission. The election security initiative, through which [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/) provided free services and guidance to state and local officials and worked with tech companies to track online misinformation, became a target of right-wing conspiracy theories in 2020, which marked it for death after Trump‚Äôs return to the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).

The program‚Äîon hold pending [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/)‚Äôs review of a recently completed internal assessment‚Äîwas a tiny part of [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/)‚Äôs budget and operations, but the campaign against it has alarmed agency employees. ‚ÄúThis is definitely in the freak-out zone,‚Äù says the first employee, who adds that [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/) staffers across the political spectrum support the agency‚Äôs efforts to track online misinformation campaigns. ‚ÄúAll of us recognize that this is a common deception tactic of the enemy.‚Äù

The election security purge rippled across the agency, because some of the laid-off staffers had moved from elections to other assignments or were simultaneously working on both missions. Geoff Hale, who led the elections team between 2018 and 2024, was serving as the chief of partnerships at the [JCDC](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/partnerships-and-collaboration/joint-cyber-defense-collaborative) when he was placed on administrative leave, setting off a scramble to replace him.

The removal of Hale and his colleagues ‚Äúwas the start to a decline in morale‚Äù at [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/), according to the second employee. Now, staffers are afraid to discuss certain topics in public forums: ‚ÄúNo one's going to talk about election security right now,‚Äù the first employee says.

‚ÄúThe fact that there‚Äôs retribution from the president ‚Ä¶ is kind of frightening,‚Äù this employee adds. ‚ÄúA very nefarious place to be.‚Äù

### Abandoned and Demoralized

The layoffs, operational changes, and other disruptions at [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/) have severely depleted morale and undermined the agency‚Äôs effectiveness. ‚ÄúEven simple tasks feel hard to accomplish because you don't know if your teammates won't be here tomorrow,‚Äù says the fourth employee.

The biggest source of stress and frustration is acting [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/) director Bridget Bean, a former [Trump](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/) appointee who, employees say, appears eager to please the president even if it means not defending her agency. Bean ‚Äújust takes whatever comes down and implements [it] without thought of how it will affect [CISA's](https://www.cisa.gov/) mission,‚Äù the fifth employee says. Employees describe her as a poor leader and ineffective communicator who has zealously enacted [Trump‚Äôs](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) agenda. In town-hall meetings with employees, Bean has said [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/) must carefully review its its authorities and urged staffers to ‚Äúassume noble intent‚Äù when dealing with [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) officials. While discussing [Elon Musk‚Äôs](https://x.com/elonmusk/) mass-buyout program, she allegedly said, ‚ÄúI like to say ‚ÄòFork in the Road‚Äô because it's kind of fun,.‚Äù according to the fourth employee. She was so eager to comply with Musk‚Äôs ‚ÄúWhat did you do last week?‚Äù email that she instructed staffers to respond to it before [DHS](https://www.dhs.gov/) had finalized its department-wide approach. [DHS](https://www.dhs.gov/) later told staff not to respond, and Bean had to walk back her directive.

‚ÄúBean feels like she's against the workforce just to please the current administration,‚Äù the second employee says. The fourth employee describes her as ‚Äúnot authentic, tone-deaf, spineless, [and] devoid of leadership.‚Äù

McLaughlin, the [DHS](https://www.dhs.gov/) spokesperson, says [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/) ‚Äúis not interested in ad hominem attacks against its leadership,‚Äù which she says ‚Äúhas doubled down on openness and transparency with the workforce.‚Äù

The return-to-office mandate has also caused problems. With all employees on-site, there isn‚Äôt enough room in [CISA's](https://www.cisa.gov/) offices for the contractors who support the agency‚Äôs staff. That has made it ‚Äúvery difficult‚Äù to collaborate on projects and hold technical discussions, according to the first employee. ‚ÄúThere wasn‚Äôt much thought about [RTO‚Äôs] impact to operations,‚Äù says the fourth employee. According to a fifth employee, ‚Äúexecuting some of our sensitive operations is now harder.‚Äù (‚Äú[CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/) has worked tirelessly to make the return to office as smooth as possible from space to technology,‚Äù McLaughlin says.)

Employees are dealing with other stressors, too. They have no idea who‚Äôs reading their [Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/)-mandated performance reports, how they‚Äôre being evaluated, or whether AI is analyzing them for future layoffs. And there‚Äôs a lot of new paperwork. ‚ÄúThe amount of extra shit we have to do to comply with the ‚Äòefficiency measures‚Äô ‚Ä¶ [takes] a lot of time away from doing our job,‚Äù says the fifth employee.

### Bracing for More

When [Trump](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/) signed the bill creating [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/) in November 2018, he said the agency‚Äôs workforce would be ‚Äúon the front lines of our cyber defense‚Äù and ‚Äúmake us, I think, much more effective.‚Äù Six and a half years later, many [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/) employees see [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) as the biggest thing holding them back.

‚ÄúThis administration has declared psychological warfare on this workforce,‚Äù the fourth employee says.

With [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/) drawing up plans for even larger cuts, staffers know the chaos is far from over.

‚ÄúA lot of people are scared,‚Äù says the first employee. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre waiting for that other shoe to drop. We don't know what's coming.‚Äù

Entire wings of [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/)‚Äîlike [National Risk Management Center](https://www.cisa.gov/about/divisions-offices/national-risk-management-center) and the [Stakeholder Engagement Division](https://www.cisa.gov/about/divisions-offices/stakeholder-engagement-division)‚Äîcould be on the chopping block. Even in offices that survive, some of the government‚Äôs most talented cyber experts‚Äîpeople who chose public service over huge sums of money and craved the lifestyle of [CISA's](https://www.cisa.gov/) now-eliminated remote-work environment‚Äîare starting to see their employment calculus differently. Some of them will likely leave for stabler jobs, further jeopardizing [CISA's](https://www.cisa.gov/) mission. ‚ÄúWhat is the organization going to be capable of doing in the future?‚Äù the first employee asks.

If [Trump‚Äôs](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) confrontational foreign-policy strategy escalates tensions with [Russia](http://government.ru/), [China](https://www.gov.cn/), [Iran](https://irangov.ir/), or [North Korea](http://naenara.com.kp/), it‚Äôs likely those nations could step up their use of cyberattacks to exact revenge. In that environment, warns Nitin Natarajan, [CISA's](https://www.cisa.gov/) deputy director during the [Biden administration](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/), weakening the agency could prove very dangerous.

‚ÄúCuts to [CISA's](https://www.cisa.gov/) cyber mission,‚Äù Natarajan says, ‚Äúwill only negatively impact our ability to not only protect federal government networks, but those around the nation that Americans depend on every day.‚Äù

[Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative / CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/partnerships-and-collaboration/joint-cyber-defense-collaborative)
No one entity can secure cyberspace alone.
In our globally interconnected world, our critical infrastructure and way of life face a wide array of serious risks with significant real-world consequences. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency established JCDC‚Äîthe Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative‚Äîto unify cyber defenders from organizations worldwide. This team proactively gathers, analyzes, and shares actionable cyber risk information to enable synchronized, holistic cybersecurity planning, cyber defense, and response.

| [Artificial Intelligence / CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/ai) |
|---|
| CISA has developed a Roadmap for Artificial Intelligence, which is a whole-of-agency plan aligned with national AI strategy, to address our efforts to: promote the beneficial uses of AI to enhance cybersecurity capabilities, ensure AI systems are protected from cyber-based threats, and deter the malicious use of AI capabilities to threaten the critical infrastructure Americans rely on every day. |
| CISA will implement the Roadmap through five lines of effort: |
| **Line of Effort 1**: Responsibly use AI to support our mission |
| CISA will use AI-enabled software tools to strengthen cyber defense and support its critical infrastructure mission. CISA‚Äôs adoption of AI will ensure responsible, ethical, and safe use‚Äîconsistent with the Constitution and all applicable laws and policies, including those addressing federal procurement, privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. |
| **Line of Effort 2**: Assure AI systems |
| CISA will assess and assist secure by design, AI-based software adoption across a diverse array of stakeholders, including federal civilian government agencies; private sector companies; and state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) governments through the development of best practices and guidance for secure and resilient AI software development and implementation. |
| **Line of Effort 3**: Protect critical infrastructure from malicious use of AI |
| CISA will assess and recommend mitigation of AI threats facing our nation‚Äôs critical infrastructure in partnership with other government agencies and industry partners that develop, test, and evaluate AI tools. |
| **Line of Effort 4**: Collaborate and communicate on key AI efforts with the interagency, international partners, and the public |
| CISA will contribute to DHS-led and interagency processes on AI-enabled software. This LOE includes developing policy approaches for the U.S. government‚Äôs overall national strategy on AI and supporting a whole-of-DHS approach on AI-based-software policy issues. This LOE also includes coordinating with international partners to advance global AI security best practices and principles. |
| **Line of Effort 5**: Expand AI expertise in our workforce |
| CISA will continue to educate our workforce on AI software systems and techniques, and the agency will continue to actively recruit interns, fellows, and future employees with AI expertise. CISA will ensure that internal training reflects‚Äîand new recruits understand‚Äîthe legal, ethical, and policy aspects of AI-based software systems in addition to the technical aspects. |
