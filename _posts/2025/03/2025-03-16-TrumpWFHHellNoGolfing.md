## [Federal workers cast Trump's many Mar-a-Lago trips as working from home](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/federal-workers-cast-trump-mar-lago-trips-working-home-rcna194641)

_‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about who‚Äôs making the rules,‚Äù one federal worker said of the president ordering employees back to the office even as he‚Äôs spent nearly every weekend in Florida._

Story by Natasha Korecki. March 15, 2025

One of [President Donald Trump‚Äôs](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) first actions upon entering the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [was to order federal employees](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/return-to-office-federal-employees-telework-policy-rcna188629) to return to the office.

The government workforce, [he](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) has repeatedly contended, could not be productive from home[^22].

[^22]: @RalphHightower: During the COVID-19 Work From Home by [South Carolina](https://www.sc.gov/) [Governor](https://www.governor.sc.gov) [Henry McNaster](https://governor.sc.gov/governors-biography) [Executive Order 2020-11 Additional Emergency Measures & Regulatory Relief Regarding COVID-19¬†Official](https://governor.sc.gov/sites/governor/files/Documents/Executive-Orders/2020-03-19%20FILED%20Executive%20Order%20No.%202020-11%20-%20Additional%20Emergency%20Measures%20%26%20Regulatory%20Relief%20re%20COVID-19.pdf)[^23], I found that I was more effective working from home without the in-office distractions of telephones ringing, hallway chats outside others' cubicles, cube neighbors' conversations.

[^23]: [2020-11 Additional Emergency Measures & Regulatory Relief Regarding COVID-19¬†Official (PDF)](https://governor.sc.gov/sites/governor/files/Documents/Executive-Orders/2020-03-19%20FILED%20Executive%20Order%20No.%202020-11%20-%20Additional%20Emergency%20Measures%20%26%20Regulatory%20Relief%20re%20COVID-19.pdf)

‚ÄúI happen to be a believer that you have to go to work. I don‚Äôt think you can work from home,‚Äù [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) said on Feb. 11. ‚ÄúNobody‚Äôs going to work from home, they‚Äôre going to be going out, they‚Äôre going to play tennis, they‚Äôre going to play golf. They‚Äôre going to do a lot of things. They‚Äôre not working.‚Äù

Three days later, [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) traveled to [his](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) [sprawling Mar-a-Lago mansion](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) in [Palm Beach](https://www.townofpalmbeach.com/), where [he](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) remained for parts of six consecutive days, according to an [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/) tracker. On one of the days, [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) signed two executive orders and a memorandum. [He also held an impromptu press conference.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4_oK1KBw7Q&t=7s)

In other words, [he](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) worked from [home](https://www.maralagoclub.com/).

That weekend, [he](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) did what [he](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) accused federal workers of doing: [He](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) went golfing. Between Feb. 14 and Feb. 19, [he](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) golfed on four different days. While [he](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) is far from the first president to do so, each golfing trip is a cost to taxpayers.

Before that, [Trump hosted Trumpian senators](https://www.c-span.org/program/white-house-event/president-trump-speaks-at-mar-a-lago/655561) at [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) in early February, where [he](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) delivered remarks including an update on [his](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) administration‚Äôs cost-cutting efforts.

Some federal workers said [Trump‚Äôs](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) frequent trips to [his](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) [luxury estate in Florida](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) ‚Äî racking up millions of dollars in security and transportation costs ‚Äî while ordering millions of government employees back to the office, reeked of hypocrisy.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clear and should be to the rest of Americans that it‚Äôs never about ‚Äòthe rule,‚Äô it‚Äôs about who‚Äôs making the rules,‚Äù said a federal employee with the [Department of Education](https://www.ed.gov/) who is also a disabled veteran. ‚ÄúThis all fits in so perfectly to the power dynamics installed by this administration ‚Äî a dynamic where [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) does what [he](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) wants, to who [he](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) wants, without repercussions.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe return-to-office mandate was never about effectiveness, collaboration or cohesion,‚Äù the employee added. ‚ÄúIt was always about federal employees being ‚Äòtraumatically affected,‚Äô as [Russell Vought](https://www.linkedin.com/in/russ-vought-787396226/) put it.‚Äù

The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) did not return a request for comment.

[Vought](https://www.linkedin.com/in/russ-vought-787396226/) was [a principal author of](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/key-project-2025-authors-now-staffing-trump-administration-rcna195107) [Project 2025](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/key-project-2025-authors-now-staffing-trump-administration-rcna195107), which came up frequently in the 2024 presidential election. Among the many tenets in the vast conservative governing blueprint is a call to significantly shrink the workforce and expand presidential power, both of which are playing out as central thrusts of the [Trump administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) so far. [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) has empowered billionaire [Elon Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/), [his](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) biggest donor who is also a defense contractor, to lead the [Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE](https://www.doge.gov/), to root out what it deems wasteful and unnecessary spending.

[Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) and [Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/) have said the [federal government](https://www.usa.gov/) is bloated, and the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has slashed tens of thousands of federal jobs already. Meanwhile, [Trump‚Äôs agenda](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) would add trillions of dollars to the federal debt, [budget experts say](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/doge/doge-trumps-agenda-calls-adding-trillions-dollars-us-debt-rcna191665).

At the same time, [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) has hit the links 14 times to date in [his](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) second term, with a [potential for more rounds expected](https://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/local/2025/03/14/trump-first-trip-since-inauguration-bedminster-nj-golf-club/82404766007/) in the immediate future. Just since January, the cost of [Trump‚Äôs golf weekends](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) to taxpayers is more than $18 million, [according to one analysis](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-golf18-million_n_67cb892fe4b02f3ad1f4b2bb).

[Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) has spent five of [his](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) seven weekends as president at [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/), and during a sixth, [he](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) overnighted at another [Trump property in Miami](https://www.trumpgolfdoral.com/). This Friday, according to a [Federal Aviation Administration](https://www.faa.gov/) notice, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) was back at [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/), where he‚Äôs expected to remain until Sunday evening. His motorcade was heading to [his](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) [golf club](https://www.trumpinternationalpalmbeaches.com/) Saturday afternoon. That would then be the seventh of eight weekends that [he](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) would spend entirely or partly away from [1600 Pennsylvania Ave](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).

At the same time, since [his](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) Jan. 20 inauguration, [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) and [Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/) have regularly denigrated the federal workforce as lazy and emblematic of waste and fraud.

‚ÄúI feel very badly, but many of them don‚Äôt work at all,‚Äù [Trump said of fired federal workers](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/doge/trump-feels-badly-fired-federal-workers-many-dont-work-rcna196068) on Wednesday while providing no basis for those comments. ‚ÄúMany of them never showed up to work. That‚Äôs not good.‚Äù

A [report compiled by the White House budget office](https://federalnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/OMB-Report-to-Congress-on-Telework-and-Real-Property.pdf) said that as of May 2024, 54% of the 2.28 million-strong civilian federal workforce worked in person, while 46.4% were eligible to work remotely. The report said 10% of civilian personnel actually worked in remote-only positions.

One [Health and Human Services](https://www.hhs.gov/) employee panned [Trump‚Äôs](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) comments as false and argued that critics of federal workers don‚Äôt realize that the public is actually getting more work from employees who are based at home and not having to spend time commuting. She also called Trump‚Äôs frequent trips to [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) ‚Äúa bad look‚Äù when considering [he](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) says [he](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) wants to send a message about saving taxpayer money.

Another jabbed at [Musk‚Äôs](https://x.com/elonmusk/) negative comments toward federal workers in light of a [Politico report](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/12/musk-influence-inner-circle-00227332) that, at [Musk‚Äôs](https://x.com/elonmusk/) request, a ‚Äúmassive TV‚Äù was installed in the billionaire‚Äôs office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building so [he](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) could play video games[^56].

[^56]: @RalphHightower: **What the fuck! Playing video games all fucking day long!**

‚ÄúI personally work my ass off[^60]. I know everyone else is. I routinely work 50 to 60 hours a week,‚Äù and longer whenever needed, the [HHS employee](https://www.hhs.gov/) said. ‚ÄúWho is going to do all this work when they‚Äôre done with these cuts? Do people think that the public won‚Äôt be affected?‚Äù

[^60]: @RalphHightower: That‚Äôs fucking bullshit! All you do is sit on your ass and watch [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/).

Another worker told of colleagues attempting to quickly sell their homes to move closer to a train stop, while others were struggling to find extended hours of day care to cover the extra time for commuting. Some ‚Äî including those who were exclusively hired to work remotely ‚Äî will likely be forced to quit.

‚ÄúEveryone built their lives around these remote positions,‚Äù said a [Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/) employee who is on leave with a newborn. ‚ÄúMy supervisor lives in [Florida](https://www.myflorida.com/) and was hired as a remote employee. She can‚Äôt relocate.‚Äù

As far as presidents, [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) is not alone in [his](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) travels home. As president, [Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) frequently traveled to [his](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) home in [Wilmington](https://www.wilmingtonde.gov/), [Delaware](https://www.de.gov/), on the taxpayer dime. Then-first lady [Jill Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) was [also called out](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/taxpayers-foot-bill-majority-jill-bidens-paris-delaware/story?id=111004942) for a costly trip as she was attempting to be at Hunter Biden‚Äôs side during [his](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) trial. Amid criticism, [Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) at the time said [he](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) continued to hold meetings and work while home. [One analysis in 2022](https://nypost.com/2022/11/18/president-joe-bidens-frequent-delaware-trips-have-cost-taxpayers-at-least-11m/) in 2022 found that [Biden‚Äôs](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) [Delaware](https://www.de.gov/) trips at that point cost taxpayers $11 million. [Barack Obama](obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) would also travel to [Hawaii](https://www.hawaii.gov/) for vacations, which was far more costly of a journey than [Palm Beach](https://www.townofpalmbeach.com/) would be, said [Tom Fitton](https://www.judicialwatch.org/about/#board), president of the legal group [Judicial Watch](https://www.judicialwatch.org/).

The group has tracked the costs of presidential travel since [Obama‚Äôs presidency](obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) and [calculated that [his](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) vacations](https://www.judicialwatch.org/judicial-watch-obama-family-2015-honolulu-christmas-vacation-cost-taxpayers-3590313-in-flight-expenses-alone/) over eight years cost taxpayers at least $85 million. In an interview, [Fitton](https://www.judicialwatch.org/about/#board) said that figure may be conservative given that it was not as inclusive of ancillary costs that are often part of calculations today.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a point. It‚Äôs not a big one,‚Äù [Fitton](https://www.judicialwatch.org/about/#board) said of [[Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) working from [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) even though [he](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) ordered employees back to the office.

‚Äú[He's](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) obviously president 24/7. There‚Äôs really no comparison between a president golfing on the weekend versus an employee who doesn‚Äôt really have to go into the office at all. Or whose job duties and responsibilities are [not] essential to the government,‚Äù [Fitton](https://www.judicialwatch.org/about/#board) said.

He also noted: ‚ÄúPresidential golfing is a perennial issue.‚Äù

[Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) had said [he](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) wouldn‚Äôt golf when president. In [his](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) first run for office in 2016, [Trump bashed Obama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPANJQ6O9bU) for [his](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) golfing habits and repeatedly contended that the public wouldn‚Äôt see him on the course if [he](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) were president.

‚ÄúI love golf, but if I were in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever see [Turnberry](https://www.turnberry.co.uk/) again,‚Äù [he](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) said in February 2016, in a reference to a course [he](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) owns in [Scotland](https://www.gov.scot/). ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever see [Doral](https://www.trumpgolfdoral.com/) again,‚Äù [he](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) also said, in a reference to [his](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) course in [Miami](https://www.miami.gov/Home). ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt ever think I‚Äôd see anything ‚Äî I just want to stay in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and work my ass off.‚Äù

@RalphHightower: We all know that's a crock of shit!

Already this year [he](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) has golfed on the [Doral](https://www.trumpgolfdoral.com/) course in [Miami](https://www.miami.gov/Home) that [he](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) once said [he](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) wouldn‚Äôt have time to visit.

[Noah Bookbinder](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noah-b-6241161/), president of the watchdog group [Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics](https://www.citizensforethics.org/) in Washington, said every president is expected to take days off to recharge while getting [Secret Service](https://www.secretservice.gov/) protection. [Bookbinder](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noah-b-6241161/) said the tension, though, is [Trump‚Äôs](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) current emphasis on cutting waste even while frequently golfing. [Bookbinder](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noah-b-6241161/) also pointed to another unusual circumstance involving [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/).

‚Äú[He](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) is not just going to [his home](https://www.maralagoclub.com/). He‚Äôs going to the [business that he owns](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/). And so every time [he](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) makes a trip, that brings [money into [his](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) business](https://www.trump.com/), which puts [money in [his](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) pockets](https://www.trump.com/),‚Äù [Bookbinder](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noah-b-6241161/) said. ‚ÄúAt the same time that [he](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) is bemoaning waste and fraud in the federal government, he‚Äôs actually through this travel having [taxpayers pay [his](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) businesses](https://www.trump.com/), which makes [him richer](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). That seems problematic and like a real level of irony when there‚Äôs so much emphasis on cutting down on government, police, fraud and abuse.‚Äù
