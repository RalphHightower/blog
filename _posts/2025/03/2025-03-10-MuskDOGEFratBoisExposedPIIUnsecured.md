@RalphHightower: The title,  All Your Personal Identifiable Information (PII) Are Belong To Us, is a paraphrase from an old internet meme, All Your Base Are Belong to Us, is an *Engrish* translation of a Japanese video game for a Sega game console [^1]

# [Former Top Social Security Official Reveals DOGE Employees Demanded Access To Sensitive Data And Exposed It In Unsecured Locations](https://www.latintimes.com/former-top-social-security-official-reveals-doge-employees-demanded-access-sensitive-data-exposed-577953)

Story by Demian Bio. March 10, 2025

Tiffany Flick, a top [Social Security Administration](https://www.ssa.gov/) before she was forced out in February [filed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/10/musk-social-security-data-doge-trump/) a declaration before a [federal court](https://www.uscourts.gov/), detailing how outside appointees demanded access to sensitive taxpayer information while bypassing established procedures and disregarding internal security protocols at the [Social Security Administration (SSA)](https://www.ssa.gov/).

Flick, who served as the [SSA's](https://www.ssa.gov/) acting chief of staff until her forced departure in February, said that [DOGE](https://www.doge.gov/) representatives sought unrestricted access to databases containing personal information on millions of Americans. She alleges that data was exposed in unsecured locations outside [SSA offices](https://www.ssa.gov) and that the political appointees refused to explain their need for the information, which is protected by law.

The declaration is part of a lawsuit filed by [Democracy Forward](https://democracyforward.org/) on behalf of unions and retirees seeking to block [DOGE's](https://www.doge.gov/) access to the data. Flick described the unfolding of the events as a "de facto coup" in which agency outsiders circumvented the chain of command and made decisions affecting agency operations. She also warned that the integrity of [Social Security programs](https://www.https://www.ssa.gov/) could be at risk due to the loss of institutional knowledge and the potential mishandling of critical data.

Flick recounted how [DOGE-aligned officials](https://www.doge.gov/) gained access to [SSA](https://www.ssa.gov/) systems despite concerns over their credentials and understanding of the data. She added that career officials resisted their demands, but pressure from the [Trump administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) ultimately resulted in their removal. Acting Commissioner Michelle King also retired abruptly after refusing to provide [DOGE](https://www.doge.gov/) access to taxpayer databases.

After Flick and King's departures, the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) elevated Leland Dudek, a mid-level analyst previously placed on leave for allegedly sharing information with [DOGE](https://www.doge.gov/), to acting commissioner. Following his promotion, he approved [DOGE's](https://www.doge.gov/) request for full access to [SSA](https://www.ssa.gov/) data, including records on financial information, work history, and citizenship status.

Flick warned that if [SSA's](https://www.ssa.gov/) longstanding data protections continue to be ignored, the integrity of the agency's programs could be compromised, concluding that the risks extend beyond potential fraud, raising the possibility of unauthorized data transfers and breaches affecting millions of Americans.

The recount follows a dire warning by former [SSA](https://www.ssa.gov/) Commissioner Martin O'Malley, who said the administration is heading for meltdown within 90 days if it continues on its current trajectory. According to O'Malley, if [DOGE](https://www.doge.gov/) keeps cutting key employees the agency will be vulnerable to outages that could result in delayed payments to the 73 million Americans who receive them.

While O'Malley has predicted a 90-day timeline for a potential [SSA](https://www.ssa.gov/) meltdown, other experts haven't agreed on a specific date for a potential collapse. "It will lead to interruptions in service, and that will ultimately cascade into more frequent system interruptions for the processing of claims, ultimately leading to system collapse and eventually the interruption of benefits," O'Malley said.

[President Donald Trump](https://www.https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump) has nominated financial tech CEO Frank Bisignano as his new head of [Social Security](https://www.ssa.gov/)—he currently awaits [Senate](https:www.senate.gov/) confirmation.
