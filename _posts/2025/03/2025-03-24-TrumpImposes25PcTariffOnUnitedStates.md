3. [Spain](https://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/)
4. [India](https://www.gov.in/)

## [Trump says countries that purchase oil from Venezuela will pay 25% tariff on any trade with U.S.](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/24/trump-says-any-country-that-purchases-oil-from-venezuela-will-have-to-pay-25percent-tariff-on-trade-with-us.html)

Story by Spencer Kimball. March 24, 2025.

- [President Donald Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) said countries that purchase oil and gas from [Venezuela](https://presidencia.gob.ve/Site/Web/Principal/paginas/classIndex.php) will face a 25% tariff on the trade those nations have with the [U.S.](https://www.usa.gov/) starting April 2.
- [China](https://www.gov.cn/) was the largest destination for [Venezuelan](https://presidencia.gob.ve/Site/Web/Principal/paginas/classIndex.php) crude last year, followed by the [U.S.](https://www.usa.gov/), [India](https://www.gov.in/) and [Spain](https://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/).
- The [Treasury Department](https://home.treasury.gov/) also extended [Chevron](https://www.chevron.com/)'s license to produce oil in [Venezuela](https://presidencia.gob.ve/Site/Web/Principal/paginas/classIndex.php) until May 27.

[President Donald Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) said Monday that the [U.S.](https://www.usa.gov/) will impose 25% tariffs on countries that buy oil and gas from [Venezuela](https://presidencia.gob.ve/Site/Web/Principal/paginas/classIndex.php), as he seeks to increase pressure on [President Nicolas Maduro](https://presidencia.gob.ve/Site/Web/Principal/paginas/classPresidente.php) and [China](https://www.gov.cn/).

Countries that buy oil and gas from [Venezuela](https://presidencia.gob.ve/Site/Web/Principal/paginas/classIndex.php) will face tariffs on any trade they have with the [U.S.](https://www.usa.gov/), [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) said in a post on his social media platform [Lies Unsocial](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114217914259825110). The tariffs take effect on April 2, the president said.

"If they buy their oil from [Venezuela](https://presidencia.gob.ve/Site/Web/Principal/paginas/classIndex.php), they have to pay a 25% tariff to do business with the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) ‚Äîthat's on top of existing tariffs," [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) said during a press conference at the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).

[Venezuela](https://presidencia.gob.ve/Site/Web/Principal/paginas/classIndex.php) exported about 660,000 barrels per day in 2024, according to data from [Kpler](https://www.kpler.com/). [China](https://www.gov.cn/) was the largest destination for the South American nation's crude exports, purchasing 270,000 bpd last year.

"This announcement by the [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) appears to be one more action targeting [China](https://www.gov.cn/)," Matt Smith, an oil analyst at [Kpler](https://www.kpler.com/), told [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/).

Brent crude futures rose 61 cents, or 0.85%, to \$72.77 a barrel by 1:15 p.m. ET. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was up 59 cents, or 0.86%, at \$68.87.

"We expect oil prices to go higher in light of this news and may rise further if [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) follows through with this proclamation," analyst [Leo Mariani](https://www.roth.com/team/detail/12460/leo-mariani-cfa) at [Roth](https://www.roth.com/) told clients in a note.

The [U.S.](https://www.usa.gov/) was the second-largest destination for [Venezuelan](https://presidencia.gob.ve/Site/Web/Principal/paginas/classIndex.php) crude last year, importing about 233,000 bpd, according to [Kpler](https://www.kpler.com/). India purchased about 61,000 bpd, and Spain bought nearly 60,000 bpd in 2024.

[Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) has sought to increase pressure on the [Maduro](https://presidencia.gob.ve/Site/Web/Principal/paginas/classPresidente.php) regime since taking office. The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) accused [Venezuela](https://presidencia.gob.ve/Site/Web/Principal/paginas/classIndex.php) of sending Tren de Aragua gang members to the [U.S.](https://www.usa.gov/) when announcing the tariffs on Monday. The [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has designated the gang as a [foreign terrorist organization](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/invocation-of-the-alien-enemies-act-regarding-the-invasion-of-the-united-states-by-tren-de-aragua/).

### [Chevron](https://www.chevron.com/) license extended

The [Treasury Department](https://home.treasury.gov/) on Monday also [extended Chevron's license to produce oil](https://ofac.treasury.gov/media/934071/download?inline) in [Venezuela](https://presidencia.gob.ve/Site/Web/Principal/paginas/classIndex.php) until May 27. [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) said in late February that he would reverse a Biden administration decision, which allowed [Chevron](https://www.chevron.com/)to restart oil production in the country. Treasury had previously [given the oil major until April 3](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/04/us-orders-wind-down-of-chevrons-oil-exports-from-venezuela-in-30-days.html?&doc=108120297) 3 to wind down its operations in [Venezuela](https://presidencia.gob.ve/Site/Web/Principal/paginas/classIndex.php).

[Chevron](https://www.chevron.com/) CEO Mike Wirth lobbied [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration) officials to extend the license during meetings last week, people familiar with the discussions told [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/world/americas/chevron-ceo-lobbies-for-more-time-to-wind-down-venezuela-operations-5afc2dee). [Chevron](https://www.chevron.com/) does business in [Venezuela](https://presidencia.gob.ve/Site/Web/Principal/paginas/classIndex.php) through a partnership with its national oil company [Petr√≥leos de Venezuela](https://presidencia.gob.ve/Site/Web/Principal/paginas/classIndex.php). The oil major has stakes in five onshore and offshore projects in western and eastern [Venezuela](https://presidencia.gob.ve/Site/Web/Principal/paginas/classIndex.php).

The tariffs are intended to make it more difficult for [China](https://www.gov.cn/) to gain a foothold in Venezuela's oil industry while bolstering [Chevron](https://www.chevron.com/) and ensuring oil flows to the U.S., people familiar with the matter told the [Journal](https://www.wsj.com/) last week.

[Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) invoked the [1798 Alien Enemies Act](https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/alien-and-sedition-acts) on March 15 in response to what the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) claims is an invasion by Tren de Aragua. The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) said its members are conducting "irregular warfare" against the [U.S.](https://www.usa.gov/) at the direction of [Maduro](https://presidencia.gob.ve/Site/Web/Principal/paginas/classPresidente.php).

[Federal District Court](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/) [Judge James Boasberg](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/chief-judge-james-e-boasberg) has blocked [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/)'s plan to deport alleged members of Tren de Aragua using the [Alien Enemies Act](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:50%20section:21%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title50-section21)&f=treesort&edition=prelim&num=0&jumpTo=true). [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) has called for [Boasberg]'
(https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/chief-judge-james-e-boasberg)'s impeachment, sparking fears among some legal experts that the [U.S.](https://www.usa.gov/) is facing a constitutional crisis. [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) [Chief Justice John Roberts](https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/biographies.aspx) [has rebuked Trump's calls](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/18/trump-impeachment-obama-judge-deportations-venezuela.html?&doc=108120297) calls for [Boasberg](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/chief-judge-james-e-boasberg) to be removed.
