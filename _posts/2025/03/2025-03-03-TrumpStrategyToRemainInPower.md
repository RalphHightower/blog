[Trump's](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/)) strategy is simple: keep [Americans](https://www.usa.gov/) weak, sick, and struggling so they can’t fight back. From mass layoffs to sabotaging [public health](https://www.hhs.gov/) and weaponizing propaganda. Mary [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) exposes his playbook for control—and why his failures are making everything worse.
