## [Trump Golf Weekends’ Cost To Taxpayers Hits \$18.2 million](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-golf18-million_n_67cb892fe4b02f3ad1f4b2bb)

Story by S.V. Date. March 8. 2025

WASHINGTON — [Donald Trump’s](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) insistence on playing golf at his Florida courses has now cost American taxpayers more than \$18 million since he regained the presidency, setting him on a pace to exceed the $151.5 million he spent in his first term, according to a HuffPost analysis.

On Saturday, [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) is playing golf for the 13th day of his 48 in office. It was his 10th day playing at his course in [West Palm Beach](https://www.trumpinternationalpalmbeaches.com/), across the Intracoastal Waterway from his [Mar-a-Lago country club home](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) and adjacent to the [Palm Beach County](https://discover.pbc.gov/Pages/default.aspx) Jail.

He spent another three days at his course in [Doral](https://www.trumpgolfdoral.com/), just east of the main runways at [Miami International Airport](https://miami-airport.com/).

According to a 2019 [Government Accountability Office (GAO)](https://www.gao.gov/) report examining the first four trips [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) took to [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) during his first administration, each one costs \$3,383,250 — a sum based on 2017 dollars that is likely higher now.

[Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) and his entourage fly down on [Air Force One](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/air-force-one/) while the military brings down the vehicles for his motorcade on [C-17](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/1529726/c-17-globemaster-iii/) transports. Because [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/), in [Palm Beach](https://discover.pbc.gov/Pages/Government.aspx), straddles the width of the barrier island, police boats with machine guns mounted on the bows patrol the Intracoastal while a [Coast Guard (USCG)](https://www.uscg.mil/) vessel is stationed off the beach in the Atlantic. Additional costs include law enforcement and explosive-sniffing dogs.
