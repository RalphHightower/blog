The Atlantic releases new Hegseth messages from leaked Signal chat
Fox News' Peter Doocy reports the latest on Signal messages between Trump officials mistakenly sent to reporter Jeffrey Goldberg.

The Atlantic published Wednesday what it described as the "attack plans" at the center of a Signal text chain leak involving senior officials in the Trump administration.


Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and national security advisor Mike Waltz have faced calls to resign following revelations that the outlet's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg was inadvertently added to a private group chat earlier this month in which Hegseth, Waltz, Vice President JD Vance and other top administration officials reportedly discussed impending airstrikes on Yemen's Houthi rebels. Hegseth has said "nobody was texting war plans" and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard vowed during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing Tuesday that there was "no classified material" in the messages.

"TEAM UPDATE: TIME NOW (1144et): Weather is FAVORABLE. Just CONFIRMED w/CENTCOM we are a GO for mission launch. 1215et: F-18s LAUNCH (1st strike package). 1345: ‘Trigger Based’ F-18 1st Strike Window Starts (Target Terrorist is @ his Known Location so SHOULD BE ON TIME – also, Strike Drones Launch (MQ-9s)," Hegseth apparently wrote in a screenshot of a text message released Wednesday by The Atlantic.

"1410: More F-18s LAUNCH (2nd strike package). 1415: Strike Drones on Target (THIS IS WHEN THE FIRST BOMBS WILL DEFINITELY DROP, pending earlier ‘Trigger Based’ targets). 1536 F-18 2nd Strike Starts – also, first sea-based Tomahawks launched," Hegseth reportedly continued, before adding "we are currently clean on OPSEC [operational security]" and "Godspeed to our Warriors."

*His first administration was sloppy with America's secrets. His second is even worse.*

March 24, 2025, 4:37 PM EDT
By Ryan Teague Beckwith, Newsletter Editor

Suppose you were a spy for a hostile foreign power, trying to figure out how to steal [America](https://www.usa.gov/)'s secrets.


In years past, you might have tried to [flip an FBI agent](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/robert-hanssen-fbi-agent-spied-russians-dies-supermax-prison-rcna87806) working on counterintelligence or [planted a bug](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/05/22/donald-trump-russia-soviet-union-spying-congress-bug-215174/) in the [U.S.](https://www.usa.gov/) [embassy](https://www.usembassy.gov/). Or maybe you would have tasked a team of hackers with [gaining access](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/how-the-russians-hacked-the-dnc-and-passed-its-emails-to-wikileaks/2018/07/13/af19a828-86c3-11e8-8553-a3ce89036c78_story.html) to the emails of members of the [Democratic National Committee](https://www.democrats.org/)
These days, the question would be what you wouldn't do. [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [first administration](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/) was so sloppy and uncaring about basic security protocols that a spy hoping to penetrate the [U.S. government](https://www.usa.gov/) faced an embarrassment of riches from [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) to the [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). His [second administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/), barely two months old, is already worse.

The most recent — and perhaps most egregious — example became public Monday when Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of [The Atlantic magazine](https://www.theatlantic.com/), revealed that late last week he was [inadvertently added to a group chat planning military strikes in Yemen](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/) involving accounts that appeared to be [Vice President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) [JD Vance](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jd-vance-770a9047/), [Defense Secretary](https://www.dod.gov/) [Pete Hegseth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/petehegseth/), national security adviser [Michael Waltz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-waltz-0557964/) and other top officials.

The breach was so egregious that Goldberg at first figured it was the kind of stunt that conservative activists have used to pull to try to trick journalists. But he changed his mind (and exited the group) after details from the discussion matched U.S. strikes in [Yemen](https://www.mofa-ye.org/) Saturday. The chat's authenticity was subsequently confirmed by a spokesman for the [National Security Council](https://www.whitehouse.gov/nsc/), who spun it as "a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful coordination between senior officials." (Asked by reporters about the breach at a [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) event, [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) said he knew "["nothing about it."](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5211142-trump-atlantic-journalist-war-plan-text/)")[^28]

[^28]: @RalphHightower: The Sergeant Schultz Defense: *"I know nothing! I know nothing!". Hogan's Heroes. CBS. 1965 – 1971. [Hogan's Heroes – Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogan%27s_Heroes)

This kind of conversation about an upcoming military operation is normally conducted through a secure government channel or in what's known as a "sensitive compartmented information facility." A SCIF is so secure that you're not even allowed to bring your cellphone into it. It follows logically that you shouldn't be holding those same conversations on a cellphone either, much less using commercial software such as [Signal](https://signal.org/). If hacking [Signal](https://signal.org/) is too difficult, perhaps a foreign spy might find it easier to hack [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/), the satellite internet service run by [Elon Musk)(https://www.x.com/elonmusk/)'s [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/). [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/) has been installed around the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) as well as the [General Services Administration](https://www.gsa.gov/) and other federal agencies, according to [a recent New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/us/politics/elon-musk-starlink-white-house.html). In 2022, a [Belgian](https://www.belgium.be/en/about_belgium/government/federal_authorities/federal_government) researcher demonstrated a method to hack [Starlink terminals](https://www.starlink.com/) using off-the-shelf equipment that cost around $25.

Or maybe an intelligence agency could recruit one of the tens of thousands of former federal workers forced out of their job by [Musk)(https://www.x.com/elonmusk/)'s so-called [Department of Government Efficiency](https://www.doge.gov/). "National security and intelligence experts" recently told the [Associated Press](https://www.apnews.com/) that the more former employees fired, the more likely it is that one or handful reach out to another country, whether out of anger or simply to pay the bills.

It can be hard to flip federal workers, though, as they are rigorously screened before hiring and typically serve the government out of a patriotic sense of duty. Maybe you'd find it easier as a spy to just rent an apartment in [Trump Tower](https://www.trump.com/residential-real-estate-portfolio/trump-tower-new-york) and get a membership at one of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s golf clubs so you can set up a meeting with him, as a [Chinese](https://www.gov.cn/) fugitive with ties to organized crime did during [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s [first term](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/), according to a [a ProPublica investigation](https://www.propublica.org/article/liu-tao-trump-meeting-china-investigation).

If you bought a membership to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com)'s [Mar-a-Lago club](https://www.maralagoclub.com/), you might even come across a few hundred classified documents while looking for a [bathroom](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/photos-from-trump-indictment-show-boxes-of-classified-documents-stored-in-mar-a-lago-shower-ballroom) or walking through a gilded ballroom, as detailed in [an indictment for a since-scuttled case against Trump](https://apnews.com/article/trump-justice-department-indictment-classified-documents-miami-8315a5b23c18f27083ed64eef21efff3).

Or you could hang out in high-end D.C. restaurants, where during [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s [first term](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/) [his lawyers were overheard](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/19/us/politics/isnt-that-the-trump-lawyer-a-reporters-accidental-scoop.html) by a [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) reporter discussing details of several investigations into the [administration](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/). Or just wait for one of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s lawyers to inadvertently butt-dial your phone and listen in to his conversation — as [Rudy Giuliani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rudygiuliani/) managed to do not once, but twice, in [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s [first term](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/).

*Every administration has its share of snafus, security failures and oversights. But the Trump administration's errors are on an entirely different level.*

Every administration has its share of snafus, security failures and oversights. [Secretary of State](https://www.state.gov/) [Hillary Clinton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hillaryclinton/), as we were endlessly reminded in the 2016 campaign, had [her own private email server](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/clinton-broke-federal-rules-email-server-audit-finds-n580131) installed at her house, which ended up handling a number of emails that included classified information. Her campaign chairman, [John Podesta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnpodesta/), was hacked by a [simple "change your password" phishing email](https://www.ap.org/the-definitive-source/behind-the-news/reporters-reveal-anatomy-of-russian-hack/). Former president [Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/), [among others](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/doj-closes-pence-classiied-documents-investigation-no-charges-rcna87396), also had some [some classified documents](https://apnews.com/article/biden-classified-documents-age-trump-2024-4791639cc06cc0affee55aba80c7e6b3). But the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)'s errors in this area are on an entirely different level. The sheer scale and scope of its transgressions against standard operational security are mind-boggling.

Some of this may be due to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s love of hiring outsiders without much government experience. Some of it may be due to disrespect for record-keeping laws. But the most straightforward answer is that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and the people he hires believe the rules don't apply to them, even if those rules were designed to protect their secrets — and ours.

@RalphHightower: [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/) has a paywall. Jeffrey Goldberg was interviewed by Rachel Maddow on [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/)

### [The Trump Administration Accidentally Texted Me Its War Plans - The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/)
*U.S. national-security leaders included me in a group chat about upcoming military strikes in Yemen. I didn’t think it could be real. Then the bombs started falling.*
