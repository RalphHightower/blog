## [Attorney General Alan Wilson defends Trump’s Birthright Citizenship Executive Order in Supreme Court brief - South Carolina Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/news/attorney-general-alan-wilson-defends-trump-s-birthright-citizenship-executive-order-in-supreme-court-brief/)

March 28, 2025

(COLUMBIA, S.C.) – [South Carolina](https://www.scag.gov/) [Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/) [Alan Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general/) filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the [Supreme Court of the United States](https://www.supremecourt.gov/), alongside [20 other state attorneys general](https://republicanags.com/), supporting [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump)’s [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-meaning-and-value-of-american-citizenship/) that clarifies the limits of birthright citizenship under the [14th Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-14/). He asserted that it is beyond time for the courts to set the record straight with a legal clarification about who is entitled to U.S. citizenship.

“For 150 years, the [14th Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-14/) has been misapplied, granting birthright citizenship to those never intended by the drafters,” said [Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/) [Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general/). “This [amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-14/) was rightfully designed to bestow citizenship on emancipated slaves, but since then, it has been misinterpreted to incentivize the ridiculous notion that someone can come to the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) in the dead of night, drop a child like an anchor, and suddenly that child is granted citizenship forever. This is an opportunity for the [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) to correct this long-standing misinterpretation. The [Citizenship Clause](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-14/) was never meant to reward illegal immigration or birth tourism. This order realigns the [14th Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-14/) with its original intent and ensures that [American](https://www.usa.gov/) citizenship is protected for those who have a rightful claim.”

The brief affirms that [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/)’s [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-meaning-and-value-of-american-citizenship/), “[Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-meaning-and-value-of-american-citizenship/),” is constitutional and necessary to curb the incentives currently driving illegal immigration and birth tourism. It does that by mandating that a child born in the United States can only be granted U.S. citizenship if at least one parent is a lawful permanent resident.  The brief emphasizes that the drafters never intended the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/)’s [Citizenship Clause](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-14/) to grant automatic citizenship to individuals born to non-citizen parents.

Under the [Biden administration](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/), Americans saw firsthand how one administration’s misinterpretation of the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/) can create one of the biggest national security crises in our nation’s history. Years of kicking the can down the road have led to a huge strain on state resources, with states paying billions of dollars for the costs of illegal immigration each year. Whether it's for education, welfare, or healthcare, states are paying exorbitant amounts of money each year to keep up.

The states joining [South Carolina](https://www.scag.gov/) in the brief are [Alabama](https://arkansasag.gov/), [Arkansas](https://arkansasag.gov/), [Florida](https://www.myfloridalegal.com/), [Idaho](https://www.ag.idaho.gov/), [Indiana](https://www.in.gov/attorneygeneral/about-the-office/about-the-attorney-general/), [Iowa](https://www.iowaattorneygeneral.gov/), [Kansas](https://www.ag.ks.gov/), [Louisiana](https://ag.louisiana.gov/), [Mississippi](https://www.ms.gov/Agencies/attorney-general), [Missouri](https://ago.mo.gov/), [Montana](https://dojmt.gov/), [Nebraska](https://ago.nebraska.gov/), [North Dakota](https://attorneygeneral.nd.gov/), [Ohio](https://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/), [Oklahoma](https://oklahoma.gov/oag.html), [South Dakota](https://atg.sd.gov/#gsc.tab=0), [Texas](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/), [Utah](https://attorneygeneral.utah.gov/), and [Wyoming](https://ag.wyo.gov/).
