excerpt: “I’m here in Washington driving to work for the last time in my Tesla. When I bought this thing, I didn’t think it was going to become a political issue. I’m a veteran. So I have a really hard time driving around in this thing. I think it’s time for an upgrade today. Every time I get in this car in the last 60 days or so, it reminds me of just how much Elon Mysk and Donald Trump is doing to our country. Talking about slashing Social Security, cutting health care benefits for poor people, for seniors. It’s one bad thing after the next. Elon Mysk kind of turned out to be an asshole, and I don’t want to be driving a car built and designed by an asshole. So, looking forward to my new ride.” – Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ), former @NASA Astronaut, combat fighter pilot"

## [Captain Mark Kelly on X: "I bought a Tesla because it was fast like a rocket ship.
