[^11]: @RalphHightower: I didn't watch or listen to him. [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) talks like a five-year old. Yes, that is disparaging to five year old, but they'll become better speakers of the English language. I'll wait until [Mary Trump Media - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSzRlpPbZTA6b8weTKnSHlA) morphs his speech to make him sound like a chipmunk.
