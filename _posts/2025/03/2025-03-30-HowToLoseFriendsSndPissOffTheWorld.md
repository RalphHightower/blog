## [Trump’s bullying is turning Canada from friend to foe- The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/03/21/donald-trump-canada-damage-ally/)

*In fantasizing about [Canada](https://www.canada.ca/) as the 51st state, Trump’s is doing needless real-world damage.*
Trump’s fantasy about [Canada](https://www.canada.ca/) as the 51st state does real-world damage 

Opinion
Max Boot. March 21, 2025

[Canada](https://www.canada.ca/) is, quite literally, America’s closest ally. It is also our second-largest trade partner. Little wonder, then, that for as long as anyone can remember, U.S. presidents have been praising our northern neighbor.

- Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964: “No nation in the world has had greater fortune than mine in sharing a continent with the people and the nation of [Canada](https://www.canada.ca/).”
- Ronald Reagan in 1985: “We’re more than friends and neighbors and allies; we are kin, who together have built the most productive relationship between any two countries in the world today.”
- Bill Clinton in 1995: “Shared history, shared borders — they are the foundation of our unique and intensely productive relationship, and alliance the likes of which the world has really never seen before.”

2017:
- Even President Donald Trump joined the lovefest during his first term. In 2017, he welcomed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to the White House by saying: “It is my honor to host such a great friend, neighbor, and ally. … Our two nations share much more than a border. We share the same values. We share the love, and a truly great love, of freedom. And we share a collective defense.”

2025:
- “I deal with every country, indirectly or directly. One of the nastiest countries to deal with is [Canada](https://www.canada.ca/),” Trump told [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) this week, adding, “[Canada](https://www.canada.ca/) doesn’t pay for military. They give us nothing. And they are the worst people to negotiate with of everybody. ... They cheat.” This month, Trump complained to reporters: “[Canada](https://www.canada.ca/) has been ripping us off for years on tariffs for lumber and for dairy products.” The next week, Trump said: “[Canada](https://www.canada.ca/) only works as a state. We don’t need anything they have. … They need us. We don’t really need them.”

With [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), there are no "win-win" negotiations. His idea on negotiations is, "I win! You lose!"
