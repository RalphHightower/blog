excerpt: "I was dreamin' in my dreamin', Of an aspect bright and fair, And my sleepin' it was broken, But my dream it lingered near. In the form of shinin' valleys, Where the pure air recognized, Oh, and my senses newly opened, And I awakened to the cry. And the people have the power, To redeem the work of fools, From the meek the graces shower, It's decreed the people rule. People have the power, People have the power, People have the power, People have the power."

Lyrics:

I was dreamin' in my dreamin'
Of an aspect bright and fair
And my sleepin' it was broken
But my dream it lingered near

In the form of shinin' valleys
Where the pure air recognized
Oh, and my senses newly opened
And I awakened to the cry

And the people have the power
To redeem the work of fools
From the meek the graces shower
It's decreed the people rule

People have the power
People have the power
People have the power
People have the power
