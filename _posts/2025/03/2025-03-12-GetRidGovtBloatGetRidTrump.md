## [Trump Has Harsh Response to Federal Workers Losing Jobs](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-has-harsh-response-to-federal-workers-losing-jobs/)

Story by Erkki Forster. March 12, 2025

President Donald Trump made it clear that he has little remorse about workers losing their jobs in his chaotic government overhaul.

A reporter asked the president what responsibility he felt for the civil servants who had lost their jobs during Wednesday‚Äôs Oval Office meeting with Irish Prime Minister Miche√°l Martin.

‚ÄúI feel very badly, but many of them don‚Äôt work at all,‚Äù Trump replied just one day after [cutting nearly half of the Education Department‚Äôs staff](https://www.thedailybeast.com/education-secretary-stumbles-on-fox-as-department-bloodbath-officially-begins/),

‚ÄùMany of them never showed up to work. Many of them, many of them never showed up to work," he repeated.

The president insisted that the job cuts are targeted at ‚Äúthe people that aren‚Äôt working or are not doing a good job,‚Äù a message echoed by the department‚Äôs Secretary, Linda McMahon.

‚ÄúWhat we did today was to take the first step of eliminating what I think is bureaucratic bloat,‚Äù [she said after announcing the staff cuts](https://www.thedailybeast.com/education-secretary-stumbles-on-fox-as-department-bloodbath-officially-begins/).

Trump and his billionaire buddy Elon Musk‚Äôs Department of Government Efficiency have [have fired tens of thousands of federal employees](https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2025/03/12/heres-where-trumps-government-layoffs-are-targeted-as-education-department-cuts-nearly-50-of-workforce/) in their crusade to reduce the size of the government and weed out ‚Äúwaste.‚Äù

The world‚Äôs richest man has repeatedly suggested that federal workers are not working hard enough, even though [The Washington Post found that federal workers usually work an average of 43 hours a week](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/21/are-federal-workers-lazy-lets-look-data/), the most of any class of worker.

But by Musk‚Äôs standards, the president hasn‚Äôt exactly been showing up to work either. He has played golf on 13 of his first 48 days back in office, flying down to South Florida to golf for [five days straight](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-golfsand-golfshis-way-through-elon-musks-mass-firings/) at the height of DOGE‚Äôs firing spree in February.

The cost of transporting the president and his extensive security for these trips adds up, with [each Florida golf excursion exceeding $3 million](https://www.npr.org/2019/02/05/691684859/government-watchdog-trumps-trips-to-florida-costing-taxpayers-millions), according to a 2019 Government Accountability Office report.

Taxpayers have already paid [$18.2 million for him to hit the links](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-golf18-million_n_67cb892fe4b02f3ad1f4b2bb) during his second term, and Trump is well on his way to surpass the $151.5 million spent on such trips during his first term.
