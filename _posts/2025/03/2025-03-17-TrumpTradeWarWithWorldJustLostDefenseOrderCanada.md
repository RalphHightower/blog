## [Possible boycott of US super fighter by closest ally: “It was the fighter we needed, but we are examining other alternatives”](https://en.as.com/latest_news/possible-boycott-of-us-super-fighter-by-closest-ally-it-was-the-fighter-we-needed-but-we-are-examining-other-alternatives-n/)

Story by As Actualidad, Paul Reidy. March 17, 2025

[Canadian](https://www.canada.ca/) [Defense Minister](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence.html) Bill Blair said that they are examining alternatives to the [Lockheed Martin](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/) [F-35 Lightning II](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/products/f-35.html).

The [Royal Canadian Air Force](https://www.canada.ca/en/air-force.html) initially ordered 88 [Lockheed Martin](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/) [F-35](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/products/f-35-lightning-ii-eots.html). However, they are reconsidering their order and may accept the initial 16 jets scheduled for delivery in 2026. They are considering alternatives from Europe such as [Swiss](https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start.html) [Saab Gripen](https://www.saab.com/products/air/fighter-systems).

“The [prime minister](https://www.pm.gc.ca/en) has asked me to look into those matters and discuss with other sources, particularly whether there are opportunities to assemble those fighter jets in [Canada](https://www.canada.ca/),” the minister said. The idea of [Canada](https://www.canada.ca/) having a mixed fleet of fighter jets is one that the [Royal Canadian Air Force](https://www.canada.ca/en/air-force.html) has frowned upon, despite the fact that it did so until the 1980s, when the current [CF-18s](https://www.canada.ca/en/air-force/services/aircraft/cf-188.html) were acquired. According to the outlet, it would mean two different training regimes, separate hangars and infrastructure, and a separate supply chain—all of which defense planners have insisted for decades are too costly.

“It was the fighter aircraft identified by our [air force](https://www.canada.ca/en/air-force.html) as the platform they needed, but we are also looking at other alternatives – whether we need all of those fighter aircraft to be [F-35s](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/products/f-35.html).”

Portugal also announced that they were canceling their order of [Lockheed Martin](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/) [F-35](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/products/f-35.html). [Portuguese](https://www.portugal.gov.pt/pt/gc24) [Defense Minister Nuno Melo](https://www.portugal.gov.pt/pt/gc24/area-de-governo/defesa-nacional/ministro) stated that the reasons were due to the unpredictable [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) and unpredictability of [US](https://www.usa.gov/) policy with [NATO](https://www.nato.int/).

[Lockheed Martin](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/) has addressed [Portugal’s](https://www.portugal.gov.pt/pt/gc24/area-de-governo/defesa-nacional/ministro) withdrawal from the program and the potential impact of [Canada’s](https://www.canada.ca/) decision. “[Lockheed Martin](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/) values our strong partnership and history with the [Royal Canadian Air Force](https://www.canada.ca/en/air-force.html) and looks forward to continuing this collaboration in the future,” said Rebecca Miller, director of global media relations for [Lockheed Martin](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/), in a statement.
