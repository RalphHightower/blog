## [DOJ Moves to Take Over Trump Defense Against Jan. 6 Lawsuits](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-21/doj-moves-to-take-over-trump-defense-against-jan-6-lawsuits)

Story by Zoe Tillman. March 21, 2025

(Bloomberg) -- The [US Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) is seeking to intervene on behalf of [President Donald Trump](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/) in the long-running civil lawsuits accusing him of being personally liable for the violence and disruption at the US Capitol during the [Jan. 6, 2021](https://www.fbi.gov/news/testimony/oversight-of-the-federal-bureau-of-investigation-the-january-6-insurrection-domestic-terrorism-and-other-threats), attack.

The cases have been held up for years amid a fight over whether [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is entitled to immunity. In a notice filed Thursday night, a [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) official told a judge [Trump](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/) was acting “within the scope of his office”[^21] during the events in question, meaning the [US government](https://www.usa.gov/), and not [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/), should be the defendant in the cases.

[^21]: @RalphHightower: That’s fucking bullshit! The [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) already decided that there were two roles, the president and the candidate, a private citizen who could be held liable. 

If [government lawyers](https://www.justice.gov/) succeed in swapping [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) out of the litigation, it would rid him of one of the last remaining personal legal threats he faces. But a judge will first have to approve the move, and the plaintiffs are expected to oppose it.

[Trump’s](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) return to the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has aided his fight against a slew of court cases filed after he left office in 2021. Following his November win, a now-former [special counsel](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) dropped criminal charges — including an [indictment](https://www.justice.gov/sco-smith/media/1366521/dl) related to the 2020 election and Jan. 6 attack — because of [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) policy against prosecuting sitting presidents. 

The [US Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) has said that [presidents](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) can face civil claims over personal conduct, so [Trump’s](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) defense against the Jan. 6 lawsuits has focused on whether he was acting within his official capacity leading up to the Capitol assault.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) lost the first round of the immunity fight. But a federal appeals court ruled in December 2023 that he could try again if he could present evidence that key events cited in the lawsuits, such as his Jan. 6 speech to supporters, were official activities. His personal attorneys renewed the immunity bid in January. [Congressional](https://www.congress.gov/) [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) and law enforcement officers who sued have continued to argue he was engaging in personal conduct as a candidate.

Joe Sellers, a lead attorney for the plaintiffs, said on Friday that they were considering their options to respond to the [Justice Department’s](https://www.justice.gov/) latest move. He said that because the immunity fight has hinged on whether [Trump](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/) was acting within the “outer perimeter” of the presidency, the issues presented by [Justice Department’s](https://www.justice.gov/) substitution effort are already before the judge.

During [Trump’s](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/) first term, the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) unsuccessfully tried to substitute the [US government](https://www.usa.gov/) as the defendant in a civil case accusing [Trump](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/) of defaming writer E. Jean Carroll after she accused him of sexually assaulting her decades ago. Following court setbacks for the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/), US officials under former president [Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) reversed course and determined [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) didn’t qualify for the legal protection afforded to government employees.

Carroll prevailed at trial against [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). He’s appealing that verdict as well as his loss in a separate but related lawsuit brought by Carroll. [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) is also appealing a [civil fraud verdict](https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2024/attorney-general-james-wins-landmark-victory-case-against-donald-trump) in a case brought by the [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) [attorney general](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james), as well as his criminal conviction on state charges in Manhattan in a separate hush-money case. 

The case is [Blassingame v. Trump, 21-cv-858](https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Blassingame_20210428_amended-complaint.pdf), [US District Court](https://www.uscourts.gov/), [District of Columbia](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/).
