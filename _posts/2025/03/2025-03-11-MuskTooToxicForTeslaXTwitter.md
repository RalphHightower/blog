## [Trump Cries for Elon, Blames ‘Illegal' Liberal Boycott for Tanking Tesla](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-cries-elon-illegal-liberal-boycott-tesla-1235293465/)

Story by Ryan Bort. March 11, 2025

[Elon Musks](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) - the world's richest man, who for the past two months has been dismantling or [threatening to dismantle](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/elon-musk-cuts-social-security-medicaid-medicare-1235293407/) government services that help the less fortunate - is having a bad week, and [Donald Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) feels sorry for him.

The [president's](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) trade wars have been tanking the stock market, and [Musk's](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) signature company, [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/), has been along for the ride. The [EV behemoth's](https://www.tesla.com/) shares fell 15 percent on Monday alone, and are down more than 50 percent since peaking in late December. [Musks](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) [has been melting down](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/musk-tesla-stock-price-plunge-1235292855/)
[writing](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114141854575248527) as a result, alleging that rival automakers and anyone who prefers them are Nazis, while accusing liberal interests of fueling the [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) downturn.

[Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/), perhaps the only human on the planet with a greater capacity for whining than [Musks](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk), came to the so-called [Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)](https://www.doge.gov/) leader's defense on Tuesday, writing in an early-morning Truth Social post that "Radical Left Lunatics, as they often do, are trying to illegally and collusively boycott [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/), one of the World's great automakers, and [Elon's](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) ‘baby,' in order to attack and do harm to [Elon](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk), and everything [he](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) stands for."

"[I'm](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) going to buy a brand new [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) tomorrow morning as a show of confidence and support for [Elon Musks](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk), a truly great American," the president continued. "Why should he be punished for putting his tremendous skills to work in order to help MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN???"

[Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) and [Musks](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) have taken unprecedented control of the federal government since the [former](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) took office in January. [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) has been signing a torrent of ostensibly illegal executive orders, consolidating power around [himself](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) and attacking the rights of Americans. Musk and DOGE have been recklessly firing thousands upon thousands of government employees and cutting vital programs, all while [rigging various agencies to benefit him personally](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/musk-doge-teardown-cutting-waste-land-grab-1235280902/).

The power couple have tried to support their actions by pushing a steady stream of misinformation about waste and fraud. There is of course no evidence that liberal agitators have anything to do with [Tesla's](https://www.tesla.com/) plunging share price, although there is [a wealth of it](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-excuses-dire-economic-outlook-ridiculous-1235292682/) pointing to the actions of [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) and [Musks](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk). [Trump's](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) claim that a supposed "boycott" of [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) is "illegal" is not only false, it is an affront to the [First Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/), toward which the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) has grown increasingly hostile since taking office for the second time - most recently in the form of the arrest of pro-Palestine protester Mahmoud Khalil earlier this week.

[Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) now appears set to stage a production around purchasing a [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) to remind Americans that the real victims are not the working class public servants who have been fired, the LGBTQ+ Americans whose rights have been stripped, or the millions of less fortunate who rely on the social safety net that is now under assault. No, the real victims are [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/), the most powerful man in the world, and [Musks](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk), the richest. They have been treated so unfairly.

@RalphHightower: Vandalism is wrong and criminal; but deciding where to spend your money is not. [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) is not the only EV available.
