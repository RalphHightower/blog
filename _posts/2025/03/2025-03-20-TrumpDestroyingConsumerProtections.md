title: "President Trump Is Destroying Consumer Protections For Americans"


[Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) is destroying consumer protections. Earlier, he tried to eliminate the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/). The [Federal Trade Commission](https://www.ftc.gov/) commissioners are appointed for seven year terms to remove politics from their judgments. It has five commissioners, so there will be one party in the majority, but the minority members can issue dissenting opinions, much like the [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/).

| Federal Agency | Functions |
|---|---|
| [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/) | The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) helps consumers by providing educational materials and accepting complaints. It supervises banks, lenders, and large non-bank entities, such as credit reporting agencies and debt collection companies. The Bureau also works to make credit card, mortgage, and other loan disclosures clearer, so consumers can understand their rights and responsibilities. |
| [Federal Trade Commission (FTC)](https://www.ftc.gov/) | The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) works to prevent fraudulent, deceptive, and unfair business practices. They also provide information to help consumers spot, stop, and avoid scams and fraud. |
| [Federal Communications Commission (FCC)](https://www.fcc.gov/) | The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulates interstate and international communications through cable, radio, television, satellite and wire. The goal of the Commission is to promote connectivity and ensure a robust and competitive market. |
| [Federal Election Commission (FEC)](https://www.fec.gov/) | The Federal Election Commission (FEC) enforces federal campaign finance laws, including monitoring donation prohibitions, and limits and oversees public funding for presidential campaigns. |
| [Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB)](https://www.mspb.gov/) | The Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) hears appeals from federal employees, and studies federal merit systems in an effort to protect the rights of federal employees. |
| [National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)](https://www.nlrb.gov/) | The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) enforces the National Labor Relations Act by investigating allegations of wrong-doing brought by workers, unions, or employers, conducting elections, and deciding and resolving cases. |
| [Securities and Exchange Commission](https://www.sec.gov/) | The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) oversees securities exchanges, securities brokers and dealers, investment advisors, and mutual funds in an effort to promote fair dealing, the disclosure of important market information, and to prevent fraud. |

*Removing two Democratic commissioners could trigger a cascade of problems for the longstanding agency, and even blow back on Republicans.*

By Nate Robson

03/20/2025 10:38 AM EDT

[President Donald Trump’s](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) purge of the two [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) members of the [Federal Trade Commission](https://www.ftc.gov/) could permanently reshape the 110-year-old agency in ways that could confuse many of the nation’s biggest businesses, trigger blowback at other agencies and even hobble [Republicans’](https://www.gop.com/) cherished goals of rolling back regulations.

By firing commissioners [Alvaro Bedoya](https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/commissioners-staff/alvaro-bedoya) and [Rebecca Kelly Slaughter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/becca-kelly-slaughter-360a8467/) Tuesday night, [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) overturned decades of precedent at a key consumer protection and competition regulator.

The [agency](https://www.ftc.gov/), under leadership from both parties, has challenged several major companies, including [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) for privacy violations, [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) for antitrust practices and [Volkswagen](https://www vw.com/) for false emissions claims. A major antitrust case against [Meta](https://www.meta.com/) is scheduled to go to trial in April.

“If this stands, it totally ends the [Federal Trade Commission](https://www.ftc.gov=) as we have known it,” said [Stephen Calkins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-calkins-2110107/), a former [FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/) general counsel who teaches law at [Wayne State University](https://law.wayne.edu/).

[Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) fear the firings are just the beginning for not just the [FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/), but the entire constellation of independent agencies that regulate American businesses.

[Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) issued an executive order in February saying all such agencies, including the [FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/), [Federal Communications Commission](https://www.fcc.gov/) and [Securities and Exchange Commission](https://www.sec.gov/), fall within the president’s purview, meaning he can directly control their agendas and fire their commissioners.

[Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) is already facing lawsuits after he removed [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) members of two other agencies, the [National Labor Relations Board](https://www.nlrb.gov/) and [Merit Systems Protection Board](https://www mspb.gov/).

Even among those challenges, the [FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/) firings hit the business and political world as a particular shock. Since its founding in the 1920s, it has run as a bipartisan commission with nominees from both parties drafting rules, conducting investigations and bringing enforcement cases — a structure that created stability and predictability for the companies subject to its oversight.

“You can’t just fire commissioners because you don’t like them, you can only fire them for cause,” said [Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA)](https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/). “The [FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/) should be an independent, bipartisan consumer watchdog that puts consumers ahead of politics.”

But the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) held firm on [Trump’s](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) strategy Wednesday.

“[President Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) has the lawful authority to manage personnel within the executive branch,” [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) spokesperson [Taylor Rogers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/taylorrrogers/) said. “[President Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) will continue to rid the federal government of bad actors unaligned with his common-sense agenda the American people decisively voted for.”

[Trump’s](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) move gives unfettered power to [Chair Andrew Ferguson](https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/commissioners-staff/andrew-n-ferguson) to drive the commission’s twin goals of consumer protection and antitrust enforcement. [Ferguson](https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/commissioners-staff/andrew-n-ferguson) has said he wants to crack down on the tech industry for allegedly censoring conservative viewpoints online.

After the firings, the [FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/) has only two commissioners, both Republican: [Ferguson](https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/commissioners-staff/andrew-n-ferguson) and [Melissa Holyoak](https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/commissioners-staff/melissa-holyoak), a lawyer seen as a pro-business regulator with narrow views of agency authority.

It is unclear how any future [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) commissioners would be nominated or approved. Given the current atmosphere in Washington, [University of Washington](https:www.uw.edu/) [law professor](https://www.law.uw.edu/) [Douglas Ross](https://www.law.uw.edu/directory/faculty/ross-douglas/) said it’s unlikely that [Donald Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) is going to take nominations from [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) Minority Leader [Chuck Schumer (D-NY)](https://www.schumer.senate.gov/), who would traditionally get to fill the Democratic vacancies.

“We are in a time of breaking all norms,” said [Ross](https://www.law.uw.edu/directory/faculty/ross-douglas/). “What are the odds [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) goes to [Chuck](https://www.schumer.senate.gov/)?”

A commission without [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org=) members presents a new set of reputational and legal challenges for the [FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/).

Though commissioners in the political minority didn’t drive policy and often disagreed vehemently with the majority’s decisions, their relative independence offered a counterweight and reservoir of expertise that strengthened the commission’s hand in court and created stability, said [Calkins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-calkins-2110107/).

The minority slots also served as training grounds for future majority rulemakers — including [Ferguson](https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/commissioners-staff/andrew-n-ferguson) himself, a [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) nominee in 2023 who was promoted by [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) to lead the commission.

[Maureen Ohlhausen](https://www.wsgr.com/en/people/maureen-ohlhausen.html), an antitrust partner at the law firm [Wilson Sonsini](https://www.wsgr.com/) and the former acting [FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/) chair during [Trump’s first term](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/), warned that investigations and lawsuits brought by the agency could suffer under a partisan commission. The different viewpoints brought by the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) and [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) commissioners, coupled with the experience of career staff, sharpen its legal arguments and investigations, she said.

[Bill Kovacic](https://www.law.gwu.edu/william-e-kovacic), a [George Washington University](https://www.gwu.edu/) [law professor](https://www.law.gwu.edu/) who chaired the [FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/) at the end of the [George W. Bush administration](https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/president/), said the agency risks losing its reputation in the courts if its lawyers appear to be “purely political operatives” working at the president’s behest.

That means federal judges could be skeptical of any [FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/) cases — particularly partisan GOP-sanctioned moves against the tech industry for allegedly censoring conservative viewpoints.

“In cases involving tech companies, [FTC lawyers] don’t get the benefit of the doubt,” Kavacic said. “I can see a way in which this hurts the [FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/) when trying to win tough cases in court.”

[Berin Szóka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/berinszoka/), a lawyer who helms the advocacy group [TechFreedom](https://techfreedom.org/), foresees less pressure-testing of various concepts within the [FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/) and also thinks that will come back to bite the agency in [court](https://www.uscourts.gov/). “This removal of the dissent function really will end up hurting these agencies in litigation over how much the courts defer to them,” he said.

“This is the sort of thing that happens in a one-party state — you just stamp out the opportunity for dissent and the incentive for dissent everywhere,” [Szóka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/berinszoka/) added. “Now that commissioners know they can be fired at whim, what’s the incentive to go out on a limb?”

Many see the [FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/) move as part of a broader strategy to force the [Supreme Court’s](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) hand on a key expansion of executive power.

[Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) is already using the lawsuits filed by ejected [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) in at least four federal agencies in an attempt to overturn a 1935 [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) decision, [Humphrey’s Executor](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/295/602/), that upheld limits passed by [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) on the president’s powers to fire independent agency members.

[Trump’s](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) [Justice Department](,https://www.justice.gov/) said on Feb. 12 it determined that agency powers have changed so much since 1935 that those protections are no longer constitutional.

[Trump’s](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) removal of the commissioners earned wide condemnation by [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) on Capitol Hill, including a letter signed by 28 [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) senators demanding that [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) reinstate [Bedoya](https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/commissioners-staff/alvaro-bedoya) and [Slaughter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/becca-kelly-slaughter-360a8467/).

[Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) were largely silent on the move. An exception was [Senate Commerce Committee](https://www.commerce.senate.gov/) Chair [Ted Cruz (T-TX)](https://www.cruz.senate.gov/), who has jurisdiction over the [FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/).

“The heads of these agencies, like all members of the executive branch, must answer to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/), in whom ‘the executive power shall be vested,’” [Cruz](https://www.cruz.senate.gov/) said in a statement to POLITICO. “[President Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) is right to challenge this precedent and return power to the people.”

Democrats fear this is just the start.

“Today, it’s the [FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/). Tomorrow, it’ll be the [@FCC](https://www.fcc.gov/) or [@FEC](https://www.fec.gov/),” Sen. [Peter Welch (D-Vt.)](https://www.welch.senate.gov/) wrote on [X](https://x.com/). “At what point will my [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) colleagues finally speak out?”

Cases involving the [National Labor Relations Board](https://www.nlrb.gov/) and the [Merit Systems Protection Board](https://mspb.gov/) are the furthest along before the [U.S. Court of Appeals](https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/) for the [D.C. Circuit](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/).

Because the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) position on independent agencies calls back to legal precedent of the 1920s and ‘30s, there’s the chance for a huge reversion in the agency’s role if the [FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/) firings go to the [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/).

If the [justices](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) agree with [Trump’s](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) legal argument, the [FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/) could be forced to return to its 1935 responsibilities to guarantee it a measure of independence, [Ohlhausen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maureen-ohlhausen-88877a14/) said.

Currently, the [FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/) is investigating [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/), [Meta](https://www.meta.com/), and [Google](https://www.google.com/). The CEO tech oligarchs were seated behind [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) during his inauguration. 

The commissioners then primarily issued reports and used its in-house administrative process instead of going to court.
