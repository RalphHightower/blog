[Donald Trump’s](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) latest address to [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) was a disaster—full of hypocrisy, lies, and authoritarian threats. From gaslighting about “free speech” to defending [Elon Musk’s](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) illegal power grab, this speech revealed it all. Even [Trumpians](https://www.gop.com/) were caught off guard. Let’s break it down!

- not a democracy any more
- joint address: rule by unelected bureaucrats is over
- [Elon Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) is an unelected bureaucrat
- [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) is head of [DOGE](https://www.doge.gov/) regardless because [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) says he is
- tariffs are making America great again, protect us
- conscious decline. Woke is bad. Woke is gone.
- go off rails: end government censorship, free speech is back. [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) trampled on free speech on [X](https://x.com/)/[Twitter](https://twitter.com/)
- will not clap. Will not stand
- cut $4B from [NIH](https://www.nih.gov/) to college grants for cancer research
- [SSA](https://www.ssa.gov/) near collapse in 30 days.
- pardons J6 criminals
- Andrew Tate faces six trafficking charges in [Romania](https://www.presidencia.gob.pa/) for next trafficking. Extradition to [Florida](https://www.myflorida.com/) because he is a [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) supporters

## Trump’s Speech BLOWS UP IN HIS FACE—World Leaders ERUPT!

[Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) just humiliated himself on the world stage—again. His unhinged speech threatening war, annexation, and trade wars has sparked outrage from [U.S.](https://www.usa.gov/) allies and global leaders. From [Mexico](https://www.gob.mx/) to [Greenland](https://grl-rep.dk/en/rep/sek), world leaders are shutting him down fast. Watch as his reckless imperialist rant backfires spectacularly.

- dictator in a small banana Republic
- get [Panama canal](https://pancanal.com/en/)
- tariffs tariffs tariffs
- [China](https://www.gov.cn/) does not control Panama canal
- annex [Greenland](https://grl-rep.dk/en/rep/sek)
- [Greenland](https://grl-rep.dk/en/rep/sek) wants independence from [Denmark](https://denmark.dk/)
- [Trudeau](https://www.pm.gc.ca/) on [Trump’s tariffs](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/). Never be 51st state
