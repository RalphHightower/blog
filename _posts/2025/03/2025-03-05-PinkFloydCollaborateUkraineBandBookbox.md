*ABOUT HEY HEY RISE UP*
'Hey Hey Rise Up', released in support of the people of Ukraine, sees David Gilmour and Nick Mason joined by long time [Pink Floyd](https://www.pinkfloyd.com/) bass player Guy Pratt and Nitin Sawhney on keyboards, all accompanying an extraordinary vocal by Andriy Khlyvnyuk of Ukrainian band Boombox. All proceeds go to Ukrainian Humanitarian Relief.

This is the first new original music that they have recorded together as a band since 1994‚Äôs The Division Bell.

The video for ‚ÄòHey Hey Rise Up‚Äô was filmed by acclaimed director Mat Whitecross and shot on the same day as the track was recorded. David Gilmour ‚ÄúWe recorded the track and video in our barn where we did all our Von Trapped Family live streams during lockdown. It's the same room that we did the 'Barn Jams' with Rick Wright back in 2007. Janina Pedan made the set in a day and we had Andriy singing on the screen while we played, so the four of us had a vocalist, albeit not one who was physically present with us.‚Äù

The artwork for the track features a painting of the national flower of Ukraine, the sunflower, by the Cuban artist, Yosan Leon. The cover of the single is a direct reference to the woman who was seen around the world giving sunflower seeds to Russian soldiers and telling them to carry them in their pockets so that when they die, sunflowers will grow.

*LYRICS*
Oyu luzi chervona kalyna pokhylylasya,
Chohos' nasha slavna Ukrayina zazhurylasya.
A my tuyu chervonu kalynu pidiymemo,
A my nashu slavnu Ukrayinu, hey-hey, rozveselymo!
