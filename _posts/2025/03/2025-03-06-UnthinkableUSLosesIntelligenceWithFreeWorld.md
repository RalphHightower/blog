## [Trump deepens NATO’s crisis of trust on sharing intel – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/nato-crisis-slovakia-donald-trump-hungary-slovakia-national-defense-academy/)

*Military alliance members already had trouble trusting each other with classified information. It’s just got worse.*

**[Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) Deepens [NATO's](https://www.nato.int/) Crisis of Trust on Intelligence Sharing**

Recent developments have further strained intelligence-sharing among [NATO countries](https://www.nato.int/), heightening concerns about trust within the alliance. Intelligence sharing, always a delicate issue among [NATO](https://www.nato.int/) members, has been significantly affected by recent events involving [Donald Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/).

Historically, distrust has existed between [NATO's](https://www.nato.int/) traditional Western members and newer Eastern European allies, particularly since [Russia's](http://government.ru/) attack on [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/). The situation worsened with [Hungary](https://kormany.hu/) and [Slovakia's](https://www.vlada.gov.sk/) pro-[Russia](http://government.ru/) stance, prompting doubts about their reliability. Current and former [NATO](https://www.nato.int/) and security officials from across the alliance have confirmed this growing unease.

The [U.S.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has now become a focal point of concern, especially following reports that it temporarily halted intelligence sharing with [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/) to push [Kyiv](https://www.president.gov.ua/) towards negotiations with [Russia](http://government.ru/). This move has raised questions about the reliability of [U.S. intelligence](https://www.dni.gov/) sharing within [NATO](https://www.nato.int/).

Julie Smith, the former U.S. ambassador to [NATO](https://www.nato.int/), highlighted the whispers circulating in [NATO](https://www.nato.int/) halls regarding the future of intelligence sharing within the alliance. Some officials worry that the [U.S.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) shift under [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) might lead to less intelligence being shared at a time when more is needed. Daniel Stanton, a former [Canadian](https://www.canada.ca/) intelligence official, noted the lack of consensus on common enemies, making countries more hesitant to share intelligence.

[Trump's](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) appointment of [Tulsi Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) as [director of national intelligence](https://www.dni.gov/) has also caused concerns. [Gabbard's](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) past statements echoing [Russian](http://government.ru/) perspectives on [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/) and [Syria](https://egov.sy/), along with her meeting with former [Syrian](https://egov.sy/) President Bashar Assad, have raised red flags.

Recently, the Financial Times reported that Peter Navarro, a top [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) official, is advocating for [Canada](https://www.canada.ca/) to be cut from the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network. This network, which includes the [United Kingdom](https://www.gov.uk/), [Australia](https://www.pm.gov.au/), and [New Zealand](https://www.govt.nz/), is considered the most intimate multinational intelligence-sharing group. Although this shift has not yet affected intelligence sharing, there are fears it could soon.

The situation following the meeting between [Ukrainian](https://www.gov.ua/) [President Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://www.president.gov.ua/) and [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) has only added to the uncertainty. While some [NATO](https://www.nato.int/) officials deny that the alliance's recent challenges have impacted intelligence sharing, others confirm that intelligence is now more often shared bilaterally rather than in full alliance meetings.

Intelligence sharing among [NATO's](https://www.nato.int/) 32 members has never been as close as among the Five Eyes due to fears of leaks and suspicions of [Russian](( penetration of national intelligence agencies. Allies typically share intelligence selectively, especially when it involves sensitive information.

Despite these challenges, sharing intelligence has proven powerful, as demonstrated when the [Biden administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) alerted allies to [Russia's](http://government.ru/) preparations to attack [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/). However, with the political shift under [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/), the future role of [U.S.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) intelligence in [NATO](https://www.nato.int/) remains uncertain.

[NATO](https://www.nato.int/) countries had agreed to boost intelligence sharing based on technical retrieval, such as electronic and satellite surveillance. However, sharing human intelligence (HUMINT) has always been more circumspect, relying on "circles of trust" between small groups of partners.

The recent developments have raised questions about whether intelligence sharing will remain a key feature of transatlantic cooperation within [NATO](https://www.nato.int/). Allies are increasingly wary of whether the [U.S.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) remains impartial in handling the war in [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/) and future negotiations.

### [Maddow Blog / Why some U.S. allies are reassessing intelligence sharing with the Trump administration](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/us-allies-are-reassessing-intelligence-sharing-trump-administration-rcna195086)

*As longtime [U.S.](https://www.usa.gov/) allies question the [White House’s](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) trustworthiness, [Donald Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) is haunted by his record on mishandling classified intelligence.*

**[U.S.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) Allies Reevaluate Intelligence Sharing with [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) [Administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)**

As the [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) adjusts its stance in the [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/) conflict, concerns about intelligence sharing among [NATO](https://www.nato.int/) allies have intensified. Several steps taken by [President Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) and his team have led to growing unease among long-standing [U.S.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) allies.

One significant move was the suspension of intelligence sharing with [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/), a decision confirmed by the administration. The New York Times reported that this could reshape the battlefield dynamics, potentially benefiting [Russia](http://government.ru/). [Senator Mark Warner](https://www.warner.senate.gov/) of [Virginia](https://www.virginia.gov/) warned that this decision could result in lost lives.

Beyond the intelligence flowing from the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), there are also worries about the information reaching it. According to [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/), some [U.S.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) allies are considering reducing the intelligence they share with [Washington](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). This reassessment is driven by fears that foreign assets' identities might be compromised, especially given the administration's warmer relations with [Russia](http://government.ru/).

Politico recently reported that [NATO's](https://www.nato.int/) intelligence-sharing protocols are at risk, as foreign officials question the safety of sharing sensitive information with the [U.S.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) The situation has been exacerbated by [Trump's](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) nomination of [Tulsi Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) as [director of national intelligence](https://www.dni.gov/), a choice that raised alarms due to her past comments mirroring Russian propaganda.

In January, Shane Harris highlighted in The Atlantic that some foreign intelligence officials have already begun limiting the sensitive information they share with the [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) administration, fearing leaks or political misuse.

The underlying issue is the trustworthiness of intelligence sharing under [Trump's](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) leadership. This concern is not unfounded, given [Trump's](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) history of mishandling classified information. For instance, in a meeting with [Russian](http://government.ru/) officials in the [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) reportedly disclosed highly classified information without a clear reason.

These developments have led to a growing apprehension among traditional [U.S.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) allies. With [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) aligning more closely with the Kremlin, the fear that sensitive information might inadvertently reach [Moscow](http://kremlin.ru/) has become more pronounced.

In summary, the current administration's approach has created significant uncertainty about the future of intelligence sharing within [NATO](https://www.nato.int/). The potential risks and implications for global security are substantial, prompting allies to reconsider their strategies.
