title: "My Dumb State. South Carolina: Attorney General Alan Wilson’s Federal Follies Follows Trump’s Citizenship Requirement For Elections"
---


[Trump’s](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) executive order mandating proof of citizenship to vote in federal elections is a solution in search of a problem. States require people registration to be citizens of the United States. Penalties include prison and/or fines.

## [Attorney General Alan Wilson backs rule requiring proof of citizenship to vote in federal elections - South Carolina Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/news/attorney-general-alan-wilson-backs-rule-requiring-proof-of-citizenship-to-vote-in-federal-elections/)

OCT 21, 2025

([COLUMBIA](https://www.columbiasc.gov/), [S.C.](https://www.sc.gov/)) – [South Carolina](https://www.sc.gov/) [Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/) [Alan Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general/) has joined a [14-state coalition](https://republicanags.com/) urging the [U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC)](https://www.eac.gov/) to require documentary proof of U.S. citizenship for anyone registering to vote in federal elections. The [coalition of attorneys general](https://republicanags.com/) submitted formal comments supporting the [America First Legal Foundation](https://aflegal.org/)’s petition to strengthen federal voter registration rules.

“Our elections must reflect the will of the American people and that starts with making sure that only Americans are voting,” said [Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/) [Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general/). “This isn’t partisan[^21], it’s patriotic. Voting is one of the most sacred rights of American citizenship. Every time a non-citizen votes, it cancels out the voice of a legitimate voter. [South Carolina](https://www.sc.gov/) has worked hard to safeguard our elections, and it’s time the federal government follows suit. Requiring proof of citizenship is just common sense; it protects our democracy and restores public trust.”

[^21]: @RalphHightower: Yes it is partisan. Why were there no [Democrat Attorneys General](https://dems.ag/) that joined the letter?

The [Republican coalition](https://republicanags.com/)’s letter explains that the current federal voter registration system relies solely on applicants’ self-disclosure of citizenship without any proof[^31], leaving voter rolls vulnerable to fraud and error. The [attorneys general](https://republicanags.com/) argue that this framework ties the hands of state election officials and prevents them from ensuring that only eligible U.S. citizens can register and vote. Emphasizing that requiring documents to prove citizenship would close these loopholes, enhance the accuracy of voter rolls, and align federal policy with [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Executive Orders](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/preserving-and-protecting-the-integrity-of-american-elections/). The [attorneys general](https://republicanags.com/) also note that the [EAC](https://www.eac.gov/) has clear statutory authority to adopt such a rule and that doing so is both lawful and necessary to protect the integrity of future elections.

[^31]: @RalphHightower: There is a significant penalty for those that falsely register: prison and fines.

[South Carolina](https://www.sc.gov/) is joined by attorneys general from [Alabama](https://www.alabamaag.gov/), [Arkansas](https://arkansasag.gov/), [Georgia](https://law.georgia.gov/), [Idaho](https://www.ag.idaho.gov/), [Indiana](https://www.in.gov/attorneygeneral/), [Iowa](https://www.iowaattorneygeneral.gov/), [Kansas](https://www.ag.ks.gov/home), [Louisiana](https://ag.louisiana.gov/), [Nebraska](https://ago.nebraska.gov/), [Ohio](https://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/), [South Dakota](https://atg.sd.gov/#gsc.tab=0), [Texas](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/), and [West Virginia](https://ago.wv.gov/).
