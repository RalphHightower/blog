## [Dick Cheney funeral will serve as a litmus test for Trump loyalists](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/dick-cheney-funeral-litmus-test-trump-loyal-rcna242265)

*How to honor [Cheney](https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/vicepresident/)’s career appears to be something of a loyalty test for members of the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/).*

Nov. 6, 2025, 6:16 PM EST
By Susan Del Percio, [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) strategist

Former [Vice President Dick Cheney](https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/vicepresident/) had a complicated relationship with the [Republican Party](https://www.gop.com/) over the past 10 years. At one time it would be hard to imagine that anyone would ever suggest that [Cheney](https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/vicepresident/) was a “RINO.” But by [his death on Monday at age 84](https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/breaking-former-vice-president-dick-cheney-has-passed-away-251271237581), the party he served had grown almost unrecognizable, due in large part to the unrestrained excesses of a man [Cheney](https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/vicepresident/) spent his last years forcefully criticizing: [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com).

[Cheney](https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/vicepresident/) was a [Republican’s Republican and a conservative’s conservative](https://www.msnbc.com/ana-cabrera-reports/watch/nicolle-wallace-reflects-on-dick-cheney-s-legacy-he-called-it-like-he-saw-it-251288645830). He served as [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) chief of staff for [President Gerald Ford](https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/the-fords/gerald-ford/biography), a [Wyoming](https://www.wyo.gov/) representative in the [House](https://www.house.gov/), and was appointed Defense secretary by [President [George H.W. Bush](https://www.bush41.org/) before becoming the second [Bush](https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/)’s [vice president](https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/vicepresident/).

[Cheney](https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/vicepresident/) was not a moderate, in any sense of the word. And his unapologetically [brutal positions on national security and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/dick-cheney-dead-trump-legacy-rcna241949) in particular earned him plenty of critics. In fact, [Cheney](https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/vicepresident/)’s first break with [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com) was tied to the so-called “war on terror.”

Early in the 2016 [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) presidential primary, during an [interview with Faux News host Bret Baier](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/dick-cheney-trump-219313), [Cheney](https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/vicepresident/) was asked to respond to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com)’s critical comments about 9/11. “He sounds like a liberal [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) to me,” [Cheney said](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/dick-cheney-trump-219313), although he did still commit to supporting the party’s nominee — whoever that might be.

Obviously, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com) won that primary, and the subsequent general election, taking the party — and the country — by surprise. This was not the [GOP that [Cheney served with quiet consistency in the 1970s.](https://www.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/07/24/cheney.record/index.html#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20(CNN)%20%2D%2D%20During%20his,through%20airport%20security%20machines%20undetected). But then [Jan. 6]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}) happened, and suddenly, our country found itself at a different sort of inflection point, with a different set of choices.

But then [Jan. 6]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}) happened, and suddenly, our country found itself at a different sort of inflection point, with a different set of choices.

[Cheney](https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/vicepresident/)’s daughter, [Rep. Liz Cheney, was thrust into the spotlight](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/liz-cheney-january-6-trump-s-grip-rnc-n1288696). Seemingly overnight, she became one of the most prominent politicians in America as she battled daily with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com) and his [MAGA](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) loyalists. Later, she served as the vice chair of the [House Select Committee](https://www.govinfo.gov/committee/house-january6th) investigating the Capitol attack, one of the [few prominent Republicans willing to condemn](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jan-6-committee-trump-capitol-attack-history-liz-cheney-rcna186138) what millions of Americans had witnessed live on television.

In 2022, the [former vice president joined his daughter](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/06/liz-and-dick-cheney-join-democrats-to-mark-jan-6-attack-anniversary.html), [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) and [President Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) at the Capitol to recognize the anniversary of the attack. His presence spoke volumes, as both Cheneys were alone on the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) side of the aisle as the [House of Representatives](https;//www.house.gov/) stood for a moment of silence recognizing the horrific events that had taken place one year ago.

@RalphHightower: That there were no "RINO"s were present on the anniversary is damning!

Liz Cheney was at the time in the middle of a hotly contested primary. With polls looking increasingly dire, she released a [campaign video in which her](https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-donald-trump-presidential-wyoming-election-2020-33ab8e7df6a6fe46661130a410487b97). “He is a coward,” the elder [Cheney](https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/vicepresident/) noted. “A real man wouldn’t lie to his supporters.” “In our nation’s 246-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com).”

However, it was [Dick Cheney](https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/vicepresident/)’s endorsement of [Vice President Kamala Harris](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/administration/vice-president-harris/) in the 2024 presidential election that ultimately severed any last vestiges of the relationship he once had with the MAGA-dominated [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) Party.

“[Dick Cheney](https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/vicepresident/) is an irrelevant RINO,” [Trump responded](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4867243-donald-trump-dick-cheney-liz-cheney-kamala-harris-2024-election/).

On the day he died, flags at the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) were lowered to half-staff, yet there was no statement from [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com) on his passing. Indeed, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com) himself didn’t publicly order the sign of respect for the longtime statesman and former [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) occupant. When asked, [White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/11/04/flags-half-staff-dick-cheney-death/87086018007/) noted that the flags were lowered “in accordance with statutory law.” As it turns out, there is a federal law that states the American flag must be flown at half-staff until a former vice president’s day of interment.

To call [Dick Cheney](https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/vicepresident/) both an influential and controversial figure is an understatement on both counts. He was both a hero and a villain to many. He was a lifelong [Republican](https://www.gop.com/); he was a patriot.

But in death, [Cheney](https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/vicepresident/) is still having an effect on the organization he helped shape for more than half a century. How to honor [Cheney](https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/vicepresident/)’s career appears to be something of a loyalty test for members of the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/), as [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) leadership has marked his passing with mostly tepid statements and remembrances. Will he lie in state at the Capitol Rotunda? Will [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) hesitate to pay respects? Just having to ask these questions makes one thing clear: This is no longer [Dick Cheney](https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/vicepresident/)’s [Republican Party](https://www.gop.com/).
