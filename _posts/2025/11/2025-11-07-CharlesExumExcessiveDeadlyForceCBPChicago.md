A [Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/) agent who shot a [Chicago](https://www.chicago.gov/) woman multiple times after their cars collided [bragged about it](https://apnews.com/article/border-patrol-chicago-martinez-exum-0d8cf987634690688d3725f8a66aab5e) in text messages to fellow officers, according to testimony this week.

Marimar Martinez, who is charged with assaulting a federal officer, was treated at a hospital for gunshot wounds after the confrontation last month.

In a Signal chat, [agent Charles Exum](https://www.cbp.gov/) shared with [other agents](https://www.cbp.gov/) a news story that quoted [Christopher Parente](https://www.cheronislaw.com/attorney/parente-christopher-v/), Martinez’s lawyer, as saying she “has seven holes in her body from five shots from this agent, who fired within seconds of getting out of this vehicle.”

“I fired 5 rounds, and she had 7 holes. Put that in your book boys,” [Exum](https://www.cbp.gov/) wrote in his Signal message, which was shared during a court hearing this week.

“Read it. 5 shots, 7 holes,” [Exum](https://www.cbp.gov/) wrote.

In a text to his brother about the shooting, the [agent](https://www.cbp.gov/) wrote, “Sweet. My 15 minutes of fame. Lmao.”

In another text a day after the shooting, [Exum](https://www.cbp.gov/) wrote, “Cool. I’m for another round of fuck around and find out. Lmao.”

Questioned on the witness stand by Parente about the tone of his messages, [Exum](https://www.cbp.gov/) citied his background as a firearms instructor.

“I take pride in my shooting skills,” he said.

Martinez and her co-defendant, Anthony Ian Santos Ruiz, have pleaded not guilty to identical charges and are challenging evidence in the case.

The [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/) claimed [Exum](https://www.cbp.gov/) was acting in self-defense when he shot Martinez, a U.S. citizen, on the morning of Oct. 4. An [agency statement](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/10/04/vehicles-again-used-weapon-attack-against-dhs-law-enforcement-officers-forced-fire) posted shortly afterward said [Border Patrol agents](https://www.cbp.gov/) on the scene were “rammed by vehicles and boxed in by 10 cars.”

[Parente](https://www.cheronislaw.com/attorney/parente-christopher-v/) has said body cam footage shows the agent initiated the contact between his vehicle and Martinez’s.

An updated [DHS](https://www.dhs.gov/) statement referred to Martinez and Santos as “[“domestic terrorists.”](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/10/04/update-dhs-deploys-special-operations-after-multiple-violent-attacks-federal-law).” They have not been charged with terrorism.

The [agency](https;//www.dhs.gov/)’s statement further described Martinez as having been armed during the altercation. A prosecutor informed the judge that she had a concealed carry permit for a pistol that was in her purse but that she did not brandish it. Martinez is not facing firearms charges.

[Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Chris Murphy (D-CT)](https://www.murphy.senate.gov/) [decried](https://time.com/7326794/ice-protests-chicago-marimar-martinez/) the [DHS](https://www.dhs.gov/) narrative as “propaganda” on social media, saying the agency’s version of events doesn’t align with the evidence.

[Parente](https://www.cheronislaw.com/attorney/parente-christopher-v/) questioned [Exum](https://www.cbp.gov/) about why he had repairs done on his government vehicle instead of preserving it as evidence, as was done with Martinez’s car. A federal prosecutor acknowledged to [U.S. District](https://www.ilnd.uscourts.gov/) [Judge Georgia Alexakis](https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/alexakis-georgia-nick) that a [Border Patrol](https://www.cbp.gov/) mechanic removed scuff marks and made other repairs to [Exum](https://www.cbp.gov/)’s [Chevy](https://www.chevrolet.com/) [Tahoe]().

A trial for Martinez and Santos is set for February.

Immigration enforcement tactics across the country, particularly in [Chicago](https://www.chicago.gov/), are being disputed in the courts. The government announced its plan for the city in early September, [titling it](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/09/08/ice-launches-operation-midway-blitz-honor-katie-abraham-target-criminal-illegal) Operation Midway Blitz.

On Thursday, [U.S. District](https://www.ilnd.uscourts.gov/) [Judge Sara Ellis](https://www.ilnd.uscourts.gov/attorney/judge-info.aspx?VyU/OurKKJRDTFUM5tZmA==) demanded the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) limit its use of aggressive tactics with people protesting the immigration crackdown.
