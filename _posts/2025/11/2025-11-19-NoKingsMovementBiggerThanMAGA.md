## [Poll shows the ‘No Kings’ protest movement topping MAGA in public support](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/poll-shows-no-kings-protest-movement-topping-maga-public-support-rcna241803)

Ahead of last month’s “[No Kings](https://www.nokings.org/)” protests, [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s launched [a remarkably aggressive effort](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-slander-no-kings-rallies-party-proving-progressive-activis-rcna238179) to slander [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s critics, repeatedly insisting that the activists participating in the events “hate America.”

The smear campaign apparently didn’t work. [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/poll-frustration-trump-gives-democrats-opening-year-midterms-rcna240551) on the results of its latest national poll:

> **The high election interest and focus on [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) also come as millions of Americans have participated in ‘[No Kings](https://www.nokings.org/)’ protests against the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/). In this survey, 43% say they consider themselves supporters of the [No Kings](https://www.nokings.org/) protest movement — with the group largely composed of [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) but also including around 4 in 10 independents.**

Right off the bat, it’s worth emphasizing that this level of national public support for a protest movement that didn’t exist as 2025 got underway is extraordinary.

What’s more, the survey data is a timely reminder of just how badly [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) have [failed to convince](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/ahead-no-kings-events-republicans-anti-protest-rhetoric-takes-ugly-tur-rcna237271) the American mainstream that [No Kings](https://www.nokings.org/) participants are violent, pro-terrorist communists, hell-bent on destroying the United States.

Even after last month’s protests, some leading [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) voices continued to go after [No Kings](https://www.nokings.org/) attendees. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), for example, [called the events](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3m3v6utg3pm27) “ridiculous,” before insisting that the Americans who protested against him “are not representative of our country,” because “many of them are lowlifes.”

The same day, [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Speaker](https://speaker.house.gov/) [Mike Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/), who [took the lead](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-slander-no-kings-rallies-party-proving-progressive-activis-rcna238179) in helping label [No Kings](https://www.nokings.org/) protest “Hate America Rallies,” [claimed](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3m3ufy3j6jj2f) that communists were secretly behind the events.

If the goal was to persuade the public to reject [No Kings](https://www.nokings.org/), the [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/) poll suggests those efforts haven’t gone especially well.

Perhaps most important is the comparison between the size of the [No Kings](https://www.nokings.org/) protest movement and the size of the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s base.

[NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/)’ national poll also asked respondents whether they consider themselves to be “a supporter of the [MAGA](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) Movement.” Just 30% aligned themselves with [MAGA](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), down from 36% from the same poll in March.

In other words, after [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s election victory last year, the conventional wisdom suggested that the American right was ascendant and [MAGA](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) reigned supreme. But as the first year of the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s second term nears its end, the number of Americans who consider themselves [MAGA](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) supporters is down to just 30%, while supporters of the [No Kings](https://www.nokings.org/) protest movement, inspired by [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s abuses and power grabs, enjoy 43% support.

This isn’t what many political observers would’ve predicted a year ago at this time, but here we are.
