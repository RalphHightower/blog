## [President Trump set to propose health care plan to fix Obamacare subsidies](https://www.ms.now/news/trump-health-care-plan-obamacare-aca-subsidies)

*The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)'s health-care legislation would seek to terminate what one of the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) officials referred to as 'surprise premium hikes' generated by the [ACA](https://www.healthcare.gov/).*

[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is expected to announce, as early as Monday, a general framework to address health care costs, calling on [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) to send a bill to his desk that would halt [Affordable Care Act](https://www.healthcare.gov/) premium spikes, according to two [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) officials familiar with the plans. 

The announcement is expected to occur at the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), and is slated to feature remarks from [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and [Dr. Mehmet Oz](https://www.cms.gov/about-cms/who-we-are/leadership), [administrator](https://www.cms.gov/about-cms/who-we-are/leadership) for the [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services](https://www.cms.gov/), according to both officials. 

[Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Majority Leader]() [John Thune (T-SD)](https://www.thune.senate.gov/), and [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Speaker](https://speaker.house.gov/) [Mike Johnson (T-LA4)](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/), were expected to be briefed on the plan Sunday afternoon, one of the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) officials said.  

The proposal comes at a tricky time for the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and the [Republican Party](https://www.gop.com/). With [Affordable Care Act (ACA)](https://www.healthcare.gov/) subsidies set to expire at year’s end — causing massive cost spikes for nearly 22 million Americans and the introduction last week of a separate bipartisan proposal from [House members](https://www.house.gov/) for a [two-year extension](https://www.ms.now/news/republicans-aca-subsidies-health-care-debate-rcna244849) of [Obamacare](https://www.healthcare.gov/) subsidies — there is a sense of urgency for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to put forward his own plan, the officials said.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s proposal, which could change, represents the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s first substantive policy initiative on health care since the start of the government shutdown in which [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) demanded that [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) act to extend [ACA](https://www.healthcare.gov/) subsidies set to expire at the end of this year. In exchange for reopening the government, [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) agreed to hold a mid-December vote on extending the subsidies. But there’s no guarantee ttat the vote will succeed in either chamber.

As [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) highlighted the imminent [ACA](https://www.healthcare.gov/) premium hikes during the shutdown, they placed political pressure on [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) to come up with their own plan.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s proposed legislation, called the “Healthcare Price Cuts Act,” according to both [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) officials, would seek to terminate what one of the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) officials referred to as “surprise premium hikes” generated by the [ACA](https://www.healthcare.gov/). The plan would also eliminate “zero-premium” subsidies currently offered under the [ACA](https://www.healthcare.gov/), intending to stop “ghost beneficiaries,” a frequent [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) concern about alleged fraudulent policy recipients by requiring a small minimum payment as a means to verify eligibility to receive benefits. 

The nascent plan also features a deposit program that would incentivize lower-premium options on the [ACA](https://www.healthcare.gov/) exchange. For individuals who downgrade coverage, the difference in coverage costs would be distributed to a “Health Savings Account” provided with taxpayer dollars. 

The political appetite is strong on both sides of the aisle for doing something on health care before the [ACA](https://www.healthcare.gov/) subsidies expire. Some 74 percent of Americans support extending the [ACA](https://www.healthcare.gov/) tax credit, including 50 percent of [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/), according to [recent polling](https://www.kff.org/public-opinion/kff-health-tracking-poll-public-weighs-in-on-health-care-debate-and-government-shutdown/) from [KFF](https://www.kff.org/), the nonpartisan health care research group. 

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is also expected to request that [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) codify into law “Most Favored Nation” drug-pricing policy through a separate bill, according to one of the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) officials.
