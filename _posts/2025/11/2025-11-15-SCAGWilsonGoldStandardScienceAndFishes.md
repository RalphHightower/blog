## [Attorney General Alan Wilson leads coastal states in call to transfer red snapper management to states - South Carolina Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/news/attorney-general-alan-wilson-leads-coastal-states-in-call-to-transfer-red-snapper-management-to-states/)

[Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/) [Alan Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general/) leads coastal states in call to transfer red snapper management to states
([COLUMBA](https://www.columbiasc.gov/), [S.C.](https://www.sc.gov/) – [South Carolina](https://www.sc.gov/) [Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/) [Alan Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general/) sent a letter this week, in coordination with attorneys general from [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/) and [Georgia](https://www.georgia.gov/), urging the [U.S. Department of Commerce](https://www.commerce.gov/) to transition management of the South Atlantic red snapper and other reef fisheries from federal control to the respective coastal states.

“For too long, red snapper management has been driven by flawed federal data and bureaucratic red tape,” said [Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/) [Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general/). “[South Carolina](https://www.sc.gov/) knows its waters, its fishermen, and its economy better than any federal agency ever will. It’s time to return management to the states where it belongs. I’m calling on the [U.S. Department of Commerce](https://www.commerce.gov/) to transition management of the South Atlantic red snapper and other reef fisheries from federal control to the coastal states, which are best equipped to ensure sustainable conservation and responsible access.”

Citing principles of federalism and State-level efficacy, the letter to [Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick](https://www.commerce.gov/about/leadership/howard-lutnick) argues that states are the best managers of their own natural resources and better equipped to collect fishery data, customize conservation strategies, and respond swiftly to local conditions. The attorneys general call for a phased transfer that includes the immediate deployment of state-led Experimental Fishing Permits (EFPs) and emergency regulations to bridge any gap during the transition.

The letter outlines several key requests for the [U.S. Department of Commerce](https://www.commerce.gov/). First, it calls on the agency to adopt science-based approaches by incorporating the findings from the Great Red Snapper Count (GRSC) into federal decision-making. The attorneys general emphasize that these findings offer a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of red snapper populations than current federal estimates. Second, the letter urges the [Department](https://www.commerce.gov/) to delegate data-gathering responsibilities to the states, recognizing that state wildlife agencies are already conducting much of this work and are better positioned to respond quickly to local conditions. Finally, the letter asks the [Department](https://www.commerce.gov/) to transfer overall management authority of red snapper fisheries to the states, utilizing tools such as exempted fishing permits and emergency regulations to ensure continuity and flexibility during the transition to state-led management.
