## [Another Signal scandal? Texts suggest Team Trump eyed 82nd Airborne for Portland](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/pete-hegseth-signal-scandal-texts-portland-rcna235885)

*Newly disclosed texts suggest [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) officials used an unsecured app to discuss deploying an elite infantry division for use on American soil.*

By now, [the basic elements of the “Signalgate” controversy](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/team-trump-accidentally-shared-war-plans-journalist-sparking-scandal-rcna197863) are probably familiar: Top members of [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [national security team](https://www.dni.gov/) participated in an unsecured group chat to discuss sensitive details of a [military operation](https://www.jcs.mil/). They also [accidentally included a journalist](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/team-trump-accidentally-shared-war-plans-journalist-sparking-scandal-rcna197863), [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/)’s [Jeffrey Goldberg](https://www.theatlantic.com/author/jeffrey-goldberg/), in their online conversation.

The [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) officials [seemed to realize](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/?gift=WtfmW8vfJXc0xmEm1jzrL3xNzqsUVHTj8lHBXxXx19M&) the importance of secrecy and operational security, but they were reckless and careless anyway.

Roughly six months later, the [Signal](https://signal.org/download/) chat scandal appears to have a burgeoning sequel. [The Minnesota Star Tribune reported](https://www.startribune.com/trump-officials-discussed-sending-elite-army-division-to-portland-text-messages-show/601485729):

> **[Secretary](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) of [Defense](https://www.defense.gov/) [Pete Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) considered sending an elite [U.S. Army](https://www.army.mil/) [strike force](https://home.army.mil/bragg/units-tenants/82nd-airborne-division) to [Portland](https://www.portland.gov/), [Ore.](https://www.oregon.gov/), to quell protests that [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has characterized as ‘lawless mayhem,’ according to images of messages provided to the [Minnesota Star Tribune](https://www.startribune.com/). The messages, casually exchanged last weekend in a crowded, public space, show high-level officials in the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) discussing the deployment of the [Army](https://www.army.mil/)’s [82nd Airborne](https://home.army.mil/bragg/units-tenants/82nd-airborne-division), an infantry division that has been deployed to combat zones in both world wars, [Vietnam](https://vietnam.gov.vn/) and [Afghanistan](https://moi.gov.af/).**

The texts were sent by Anthony Salisbury, a deputy to [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) policy adviser Stephen Miller, who communicated over Signal “while traveling in [Minnesota](https://www.mn.gov/) and in clear view of others”; and were received by Patrick Weaver, a senior advisor to [Secretary](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) of [Defense](https://www.defense.gov/) [Pete Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/), according to the [Star Tribune](https://www.startribune.com/)’s report (which has not been independently verified by MSNBC).

A source, the newspaper continued, was “troubled by seeing sensitive military planning discussed so openly,” and so this person contacted the [Star Tribune](https://www.startribune.com/).

If this reporting is correct, it’s a story with multiple dimensions. It’s notable, for example, that [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/) [reported last week](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/29/stephen-miller-venezuela-drug-boat-strike) that Miller, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s deputy chief of staff, has played “a leading role” in making decisions related to use of military resources, and the [Star Tribune](https://www.startribune.com/)’s article lends additional credence to those concerns.

What’s more, despite the severity of the “Signalgate” controversy from the spring, it appears the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) learned very little from the fiasco, as members continue to have casual online conversations about sensitive security matters.

But most important of all is that top [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) officials appear to be discussing the deployment of an elite infantry division for use on American soil in a city in which there is no actual crisis. (A judge issued a temporary restraining order Sunday night to prevent the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) from [sending even federalized National Guard](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-tries-fails-circumvent-court-ruling-unnecessary-portland-troop-d-rcna235843) to [Oregon](https://www.oregon.gov/.)

Evidently, [Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) expressed some reluctance about this, and according to texts from his aide, the [Pentagon chief](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) wanted [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to expressly tell him to send troops into the American city. From the [Star Tribune](https://www.startribune.com/) report:

> **‘Between you and I, I think [Pete](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) just wants the top cover from the boss if anything goes sideways with the troops there,’ Weaver wrote. He acknowledged the potential political ramification of deploying [Army troops](https://www.army.mil/) to a U.S. city. [Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) preferred to send the [National Guard](https://www.nationalguard.mil/), he wrote.**

“[82nd](https://home.army.mil/bragg/units-tenants/82nd-airborne-division) is like our top tier [quick reaction force] for abroad. So it will cause a lot of headlines,” he added. “Probably why he wants potus to tell him to do it.”

The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) made no effort to deny the authenticity of the [Signal](https://signal.org/) chat, telling the [Star Tribune](https://www.startribune.com/), “Nothing in these private conversations, that are shamefully being reported on by morally bankrupt reporters, is new or classified information.” Similarly, a [Defense Department](https://www.defense.gov/) spokesperson said the messages show officials were “working around the clock.”

I don’t imagine we’ve heard the last of this one.
