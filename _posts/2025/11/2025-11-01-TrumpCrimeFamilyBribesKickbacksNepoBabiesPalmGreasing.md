## [As Americans white-knuckle through a shutdown, Trump’s corruption takes center stage](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-corruption-egypt-qatar-argentina-strongman-rcna237585)

*There’s a reason why every opposition movement to every authoritarian government focuses on the self-dealing and self-enrichment of the strongman leader.*

Oct. 14, 2025, 3:41 PM EDT
By [Rachel Maddow](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/rachel-maddow-biography-n1157621)

On Monday, shortly after [Donald Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/donald-trump) gave a speech at the [Israeli parliament](https://main.knesset.gov.il/), he traveled to [Egypt](https://www.presidency.eg/) to sign [a memorandum](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/10/the-trump-declaration-for-enduring-peace-and-prosperity/) related to the [Israeli](https://www.gov.il/)-Hamas ceasefire deal. While in [Egypt](https://www.presidency.eg/), the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) sat down with the [country’s president](https://www.presidency.eg/), [Abdel Fattah el-Sissi](https://www.msnbc.com/ana-cabrera-reports/watch/trump-speaks-in-egypt-after-visit-to-israel-249777221862), and said something rather strange.

He told reporters that the reason [Egypt](https://www.presidency.eg/) was chosen as the location to sign this historic peace deal was because [Sissi](https://www.presidency.eg/) had been “very helpful” and was a “great leader.” The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) also said he wanted to “thank” the [Egyptian leader](https://www.presidency.eg/), who he said had “been my friend right from the beginning, during the campaign against Crooked Hillary Clinton.”

Now, you may be wondering: Why would [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) even mention Clinton in that moment?

Well, during his 2016 run against Clinton, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) singled out [Sissi](https://www.presidency.eg/), who came to power in 2013 by military coup, for all sorts of [inexplicable praise](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/donald-trump-egypt-228393). Just a few weeks before Election Day, as his campaign was running out of money and it appeared he was going to lose, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) took a one-on-one meeting with the [Egyptian leader](https://www.presidency.eg/). After the meeting, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) called [Sissi](https://www.presidency.eg/) a [“fantastic guy” and](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/trump-praises-egypts-al-sisi-hes-a-fantastic-guy-228560) promised that, if elected, the United States would be a “loyal friend” to [Egypt](https://www.presidency.eg/).

> *There’s no reason an American [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) should be arranging meetings for a family member with the head of state of another country.*

When [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was elected, he made good on that promise. He brought [Sissi](https://www.presidency.eg/) to be one of his [first guests at the White House](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/03/world/middleeast/-egypt-sisi-trump-white-house.html) and showered him with praise. He gave [Egypt](https://www.presidency.eg/) nearly [\$200 million](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/25/politics/us-military-aid-egypt) that his own [State Department](https://www.state.gov/) opposed, then he gave them more than \$1 billion after that.

Last year, thanks to a bombshell report from [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2024/08/02/trump-campaign-egypt-investigation/), we learned that back in 2019, the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) allegedly shut down an investigation involving a \$10 million cash withdrawal from [Egypt](https://www.presidency.eg/)’s national bank.

According to the [Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/), classified U.S. intelligence indicated that [Sissi](https://www.presidency.eg/) “sought to give [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) \$10 million to boost his 2016 presidential campaign.” The [Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) went on to report: “Investigators had also sought to learn if money from [Sissi](https://www.presidency.eg/) might have factored into [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s decision in the final days of his run for the White House to inject his campaign with \$10 million of his own money.”

At the time, a spokesman for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s campaign said the reporting was “textbook Fake News.”

In the end, what potentially could have been a bribe was never traced, and no one knows, to this day, officially, why [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), all these years later, is still thanking the strongman leader of [Egypt](https://www.presidency.eg/) for something he did to help [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) in his campaign against [Clinton](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/clinton-take-trump-at-his-word-and-be-outraged-by-what-he-represents-219498565926).

At that same event on Monday in [Egypt](https://www.presidency.eg/), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was [caught on a hot mic](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/hot-mic-catches-indonesian-president-asking-trump-meeting-son-eric-rcna237501) seemingly trying to set up a meeting between his son [Eric Trump](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erictrump/), who manages the [family business](https://www.trump.com/), and the [president](https://www.presidenri.go.id/) of [Indonesia](https://indonesia.go.id/).

[Eric Trump](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erictrump/) has no job in the government; there’s no reason an American president should be arranging meetings for a family member with the head of state of another country. That said, earlier this month, [Eric Trump](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erictrump/) was promoting the family’s brand new golf course deal in [Indonesia](https://indonesia.go.id/), [calling it](https://x.com/EricTrump/status/1973778982744260916) one of the most “stunning golf destinations.” And now [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), in his official capacity, appeared to be hooking up his son with the [president](https://www.presidenri.go.id/) of the country hosting the new [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) family boondoggle.

That’s not, of course, to be confused with the family boondoggle in [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/), where the [Trumps](https://trump.com/) also plan to build [a golf course](https://apnews.com/article/trump-qatar-deal-conflicts-saudi-arabia-emoluments-7379bee2e307d39bd43b534a05ae3207) and [hotel](https://www.trump.com/golf/trump-international-doha).

You may remember that during [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s first term, he called [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) [a funder of terrorism at a very high level.”](https://www.c-span.org/clip/white-house-event/president-calls-on-qatar-to-stop-supporting-terrorism/4673146)
 However, this time around, on top of closing a deal for a [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) luxury development in [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/), the country has given the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) a [\$400 million luxury jet](https://www.msnbc.com/all-in/watch/-hand-me-down-how-trump-got-his-jet-from-qatar-239693381917), which he says he plans to re-fit at taxpayer expense for his own use as [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), and then keep for his [presidential library]() after he leaves office.

Earlier this month, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) announced that if [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) is attacked, the United States will [respond as if we have been attacked](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-offers-qatar-gave-fancy-plane-nato-security-guarantee-rcna235175). He has basically given them fake [NATO](https://www.nato.int/) membership on his own say-so. And on Friday, [Defense](https://www.defense.gov/) [Secretary Pete Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) announced that the United States would host a [Qatari air force facility](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/pete-hegseths-odd-comments-qatar-air-force-base-spark-swift-backlash-rcna237275) at the [Mountain Home Airbase (MUO)](https://www.mountainhome.af.mil/) in Idaho.

Expectedly, [Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/)’s announcement was quickly met with backlash. The former “Faux and Friends Weekend” co-host then had to issue what he called an [“important clarification.”](https://x.com/PeteHegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/)/status/1976769302867898706) [Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) said that [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) was not building its own airbase on American soil; instead, they would simply be allowed to use an existing airbase in [Idaho](https://www.idaho.gov/), which would remain under U.S. jurisdiction.

But the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is keeping their plane and [the family](https://www.trump.com/) is building their big golf course and hotel, and presumably whatever else they want, because that’s the way the presidency works now under [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/): You put money in his pocket, and give money to his family, and he hooks you up with basically whatever you want out of the pockets of the American people from the [U.S. Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/), all while the federal government remains at a standstill.

It's one thing to have the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) leave the country and fly to another country during a shutdown, like [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) did on Monday, but it’s another thing to have the U.S. government fund another country’s government while we’re not funding ours.

Last week, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s [treasury secretary, Scott Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent), finalized a deal to send [$20 billion of U.S. taxpayer dollars](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/america-first-trump-argentina-bailout-shutdown-rcna236938). We are bailing out their currency, for some reason. [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/)’s currency has dropped 27% in value already this year.

But don’t worry, it’s just a loan, right? We’ll get it back? I’m not too sure about that. The [International Monetary Fund (IMF)](https://www.imf.org/) has had to bail out [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/) 23 times, and the country owes it more money than any other country on earth. The most recent IMF bailout was just [in April](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2025/04/12/pr25101-argentina-imf-executive-board-approves-48-month-usd20-billion-extended-arrangement), and even that wasn’t enough to keep their economy and their peso from continuing to tank.

But [Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent), nevertheless, just gave [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/) \$20 billion of your money to prop them up, even though we have almost no trade with them, and if their economy or their currency collapses, it would likely have no effect on us.

> *There goes \$20 billion of your money to buy nearly worthless pesos while American hospitals are white-knuckling it through a government shutdown.*

Even after the infusion, according to [a report from CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/13/the-us-has-stepped-in-with-an-extraordinary-bailout-of-argentina-heres-what-it-means.html), the markets have reacted in such a way that indicates the \$20 billion may not be enough, which, presumably, best case, means we’ll never get that money back, or, worst case, we’ll give them even more.

Why, when our own government is shut down, are we giving [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/) billions to keep its government going? I’m not sure, but there are at least two billionaires who are [very close to Bessent](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/us/politics/argentina-bailout-investors.html) who have made big bets on the health of [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/)’s economy. So, for those rich guy friends of [Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent), including [Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent)’s former mentor on Wall Street, they stand to make a lot of money if the U.S. taxpayer starts propping up that failing country, and they stand to lose a lot if we don’t.

There goes \$20 billion of your money to buy nearly worthless pesos in [Buenos Aires](https://buenosaires.gob.ar/inicio/) while [Yellowstone]() shuts down, and people who work for the [TSA](https://www.tsa.gov/) don’t get paid, and American hospitals are white-knuckling it through a [government shutdown](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/mike-johnsons-house-shutdown-epstein-files-rcna237374) with no end in sight.

This is why every opposition movement to every authoritarian government everywhere on earth focuses on the corruption, self-dealing and self-enrichment of the supposed strongman leader, his family and his cronies.

What happens when you lose the rule of law? When you lose a professional government? When the democratic right to replace your leaders is taken away from you? What happens is that the strongman and his cronies get very rich, and they think they don’t have to answer to anyone ever.

They get everything for themselves, while for everyone else — for regular people — everything crumbles.
