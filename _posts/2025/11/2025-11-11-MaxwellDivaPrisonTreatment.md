> From: Ghislaine Maxwell<br /><br />To: (Maxwell's relative)<br /><br />Date: 08/08/2025 8:08 a.m.<br /><br />Bryan is a different beast in every possible respect to Tal. It is a well managed well run institution with an execellent Warden who leads from the top. She is a true professional and the best representative of the BOP I have met. The food is legions better, the place is clean, the staff responsive and polite - I haven't seen or heard the usual foul language or screaming accompanied by threats leveled at inmates by anyone. I have not seen a single fight, drug deal, passed out person or naked inmate running around or several of them congregating in a shower! In other words I feel like I have dropped through Alice in Wonderlands looking glass. I am much much happier here and more importantly safe. So yes everyone can breath a sigh.

> From: Ghislaine Maxwell<br /><br />To: (Maxwell's attorney)<br /><br />Date: 9/16/2025 11:35 a.m.<br /><br />Helloo.. I spoke to the Warden about the problem with the mail telling her that the documents have not arrived yet and now we are on day 7. I explained that we have a deadline that hinges on the Supreme Court and that I was hoping to have 2 turns of the document before it files with the court possibly as soon as the end of the month<br />
<br /><br />Her creative solution was that you EM/scan it to her and she will scan back my changes! Of course that is fantastic as it saves days and days. I assume that you are fine with that?

*In a letter to the [president](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) say Maxwell’s treatment as she prepares a clemency request makes the convicted sex offender look like a “guest at a [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) hotel.”*

[Ghislaine Maxwell, the Jeffrey Epstein confidante and convicted child sex trafficker](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/watch/ghislaine-maxwell-guilty-of-federal-sex-trafficking-for-role-in-jeffrey-epstein-s-abuses-129785925892), is being waited on “hand and foot” by the staff at her [minimum security prison camp](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/ghislaine-maxwell-moved-lower-security-facility-texas-rcna222516) while she prepares a request that [President](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) commute her sentence, according to whistleblower revelations made public on Monday by [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)s.

“The deference and servility to Ms. Maxwell have reached such preposterous levels that one of the top officials at the facility has complained that he is ‘sick of having to be Maxwell’s bitch,’” according to a letter to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) from [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Jamie Raskin (D-MD8)](https://raskin.house.gov/), the ranking [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) on the [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Judiciary Committee](https://judiciary.house.gov/).

In August, Maxwell, who is serving a [20-year sentence](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/ghislaine-maxwell-sentenced-20-years-prison-conspiring-jeffrey-epstein-sexually-abuse) for helping Epstein prey sexually on children and young women, had an [unusual](https://www.justice.gov/maxwell-interview) interview with the [deputy](https://www.justice.gov/dag/) [attorney general](https://www.justice.gov/), [Todd Blanchehttps://judiciary.house.gov/), who once was [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s personal defense attorney. She told [Blanche](https://www.justice.gov/dag/) she never saw [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) behaving inappropriately.

After the interview, she was transferred from a [low security prison in Florida](https://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/tal/) to a [minimum security federal prison camp](https://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/bry/) in Bryan, Texas. The [Federal Bureau of Prisons](https://www.bop.gov/) has not explained the transfer, which [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) and other outlets reported deviated from a policy that generally forbids sex offenders from serving in prison camps.

> **The [Federal Bureau of Prisons](https://www.bop.gov/) has not explained the transfer, which [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) and other outlets reported deviated from a policy that generally forbids sex offenders from serving in prison camps.**

Days after her arrival, she [said in emails](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ghislaine-maxwell-prison-emails-minimum-security-bryan-texas-rcna242218) to friends and relatives that she was much happier at the less restrictive facility.

Now [Judiciary](https://judiciary.house.gov/) [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) say they have obtained documents and whistleblower information that Maxwell is receiving special favors at the prison camp — benefits unavailable to other inmates.

[Raskin](https://raskin.house.gov/)’s letter said Maxwell has received customized meals personally delivered to her cell, after-hours time in a private exercise area and access to a service puppy.

[Raskin](https://raskin.house.gov/) said Maxwell was also afforded private meetings with visitors arranged by the warden, complete with snacks. The guests were allowed to bring computers, which [Raskin](https://raskin.house.gov/) described as “an unprecedented action” that risked Maxwell having “unmonitored communications with the outside world.”

When the phone lines went down for other inmates at the camp, [Raskin](https://raskin.house.gov/) said, Maxwell had friends and relatives call prison employees, who then could help her speak to them.

“These luxuries and amenities … mark Ms. Maxwell more as a guest at a [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) hotel than a federal prisoner and child sex offender,” [Raskin](https://raskin.house.gov/) wrote.

While prison officials “cater to her every need,” [Raskin](https://raskin.house.gov/) wrote, Maxwell has also been preparing a written request that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) commute her sentence.

“The Warden herself is directly helping Ms. Maxwell copy, print, and send documents related to this application,” [Raskin](https://raskin.house.gov/) wrote.

[Raskin](https://raskin.house.gov/) said [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) have been told that “any inmate or staff who questions or blows the whistle on the institution’s grotesque pampering of a serial sexual abuser and human trafficker at taxpayer expense is being punished and retaliated against” by the warden, Tanisha Hall.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) should not grant Maxwell clemency, [Raskin](https://raskin.house.gov/) wrote.

“Maxwell was convicted by a jury of her peers for some of the most harrowing conduct criminalized by our laws: conduct for which she reportedly showed an ‘utter lack of remorse.’”

He pointed out that the trial judge declared that Maxwell “directly and repeatedly and over the course of many years participated in a horrific scheme to entice, transport, and traffic underage girls, some as young as 14, for sexual abuse by and with Jeffrey Epstein.”

[Raskin](https://raskin.house.gov/) concludes the letter by asking [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) whether he has discussed clemency for Maxwell with anyone, and whether Maxwell is offering [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) anything in return.

The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
