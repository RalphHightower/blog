*The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) staved off financial disaster with an infusion of cash. Now what?*

Oct. 31, 2025, 12:41 PM EDT
By Joseph Zeballos-Roig

When you default on your car loan, creditors seize your car. [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/)’s credit is so bad that it once had [a military vessel seized](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-20743016) by a foreign hedge fund.

Since 2000, the [South American country](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/) has defaulted three times, developing a financial reputation so abysmal that few were surprised when a subsidiary of a U.S. hedge fund impounded the ARA Libertad during a stop in a [Ghanian](https://www.ghana.gov.gh/) port in 2012 in an effort to compel back payments.

With [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/) staring down another full-blown financial crisis, [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) swooped in with \$40 billion in U.S. assistance, helping flamboyant libertarian [President](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/presidencia) [Javier Milei](https://www.casarosada.gob.ar/el-presidente/)’s party [win midterm elections](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gw8qpyvqdo) and continue his [DOGE](https://doge.gov/)-style agenda of radical spending cuts to the [Argentine government](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/). It’s a short-term win for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), who previously threatened to pull the plug on the entire bailout if [Milei](https://www.casarosada.gob.ar/el-presidente/) lost. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was quick to claim credit for his ally’s unexpectedly strong showing a day later.

“He had a lot of help from us,” the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) said on Monday. “We’re getting a real strong handle on South America.”

> *The quick fix doesn’t begin to address the serious, long-term problems of an underdeveloped economy.*

But the quick financial fix doesn’t begin to address the serious, long-term problems of an underdeveloped economy stuck in an endless cycle of default. And the bailout means [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has waded into a financial quagmire with little sign of an exit strategy beyond personal whim, ushering in a new era of freewheeling U.S. intervention in Latin America.

[Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/) is famously in a category of its own among emerging countries. Once a wealthy nation on par with [Britain](https://www.gov.uk/) or [France](https://www.info.gouv.fr/) in the early 20th century, it eventually fell victim to soaring inflation, currency crashes and bungled reforms. [Buenos Aires](https://buenosaires.gob.ar/inicio/) most recently defaulted in May 2020 [when it failed](https://www.wsj.com/articles/argentina-moves-closer-to-sovereign-debt-default-amid-coronavirus-crisis-11590160035?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqdIfZQXMg-ns-4_veL41lQXQQiEEIgY1OuhdlM7FQA-6Sc7rGSo9ETnk_WYa3g%3D&gaa_ts=6902dc5b&gaa_sig=5b4NKefl1aYIwSRGKLHAnwhQd2YpLn2AmIJWoLdHgP7GpUzN-y7_D8sGq3zkQ0kSdMIWB3AdLqc1w-pBVLeIkQ%3D%3D) to make an interest payment on foreign debt during the pandemic.

[Monica de Bolle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/monica-baumgarten-de-bolle-76574067/), a former economist for the [International Monetary Fund](https://www.imf.org/) I spoke with, compared [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/)’s economy to a sphinx that routinely devours policymakers. No one has succeeded in cracking the riddle so far. Not [Argentinian](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/) leaders, and certainly not the [IMF](https://www.imf.org/).

The [IMF](https://www.imf.org/) has assembled 23 loan packages since the late 1950s. Those back-to-back loans haven’t put the country on a path to regain its privileged status as an advanced economy. Its latest \$20 billion loan [was issued](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2025/04/12/pr25101-argentina-imf-executive-board-approves-48-month-usd20-billion-extended-arrangement) in April, and [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/) still owes the [IMF about \$42 billion](https://www.imf.org/external/np/fin/tad/balmov2.aspx?type=TOTAL). Talk about a huge sum. The amount is quadruple of what war-torn Ukraine is on the hook for with the [IMF](https://www.imf.org/).

During annual meetings of the [IMF](https://www.imf.org/) and [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/) earlier this month, I noticed [IMF](https://www.imf.org/) officials were careful not to step on [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s toes about a bailout that’s only grown since then. “We think the support from the [U.S. Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/) is helping to stabilize markets and will complement the fund’s support program,” [IMF](https://www.imf.org/) [West Hemisphere Director Nigel Chalk](https://www.imf.org/en/About/senior-officials/Bios/nigel-chalk) said at a press conference. He didn’t answer a flurry of questions from reporters pressing for specifics about [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/)’s future.

[Milei](https://www.casarosada.gob.ar/el-president)e/) succeeded in restoring budget surpluses and curbing inflation through his almost two-year austerity crusade. But the reforms came at sizable cost, with stalling growth and a cascade of job losses.

There is still a mighty challenge ahead: Taming an unruly currency that most analysts consider overvalued. The [Argentinian](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/) peso is traded within a currency band helmed by its [central bank](https://www.bcra.gob.ar/), meaning the peso-dollar exchange rate is kept within a specific range. By comparison, the U.S. dollar floats freely in a sign of its strength among investors.

Panicked traders went on a spree selling off the peso leading up to the election, fearing [Milei](https://www.casarosada.gob.ar/el-president)e/) was about to lose the ability to carry out his libertarian reforms. [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/)’s [central bank](https://www.bcra.gob.ar/) then stepped in to defend a weakening peso by spending scarce dollar reserves, and the financial cavalry arrived from the north. [Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/) [Secretary Scott Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) [declared](https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2025-09-22/us-announces-it-will-do-whatever-is-necessary-to-support-argentina.html) that the U.S. will “do what is necessary” to shore up [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/). It’s nothing short of an open-ended promise.

> *The pesos’s post-election surge faded fast.*

The pesos’s post-election surge, though, [faded fast](https://www.ft.com/content/6cc3cfb5-7935-4ab2-8a34-933fcfef3ed6). Most observers believe the peso must be allowed to float since it will be unsustainable to keep in a band that requires constant intervention. However, taking that step will probably mean a drop in its value, at least at the outset. For example, the 9,000 pesos I have left over in cash — a modest amount now totaling \$6.30 — shed 16% of their value since January. Now scale that amount to the billions of dollars at stake through the [U.S. Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/)’s limited purchases so far. It doesn’t take years of trading expertise to spot a risky bet.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) will have decisions to make if his [Argentinian](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/) gamble goes south. He could deepen the U.S. footprint in the country’s markets, which already surpasses the 1995 [Mexican](https://www.gob.mx/) bailout because the U.S. directly bought [Argentinian](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/) pesos this time instead of providing a loan with strings attached. That could stir rare criticism from [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) and further [upset cattle producers](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-beef-prices-argentina-ranchers-rcna239566) already angry about [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s plan to import more beef from [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/).

Or he could pull strings behind the scenes, similar to when former [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Bill Clinton](https://clintonwhitehouse2.archives.gov/) [helped fast-track](https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/06/26/russian-election-interference-meddling/) an [IMF](https://www.imf.org/) bailout of [Russia](http://government.ru/) ahead of a 1996 election. There are signs that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is already pursuing this route by reportedly working in tandem with major banks like [JPMorgan Chase](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/) and [Bank of America](https://www.bankofamerica.com/) to assemble a parallel aid measure. [JPMorgan Chase](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/) [CEO Jamie Dimon](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/about/leadership/jamie-dimon) [met with Milei](https://x.com/OPRArgentina/status/1981866806303396271) during a visit to [Buenos Aires](https://buenosaires.gob.ar/inicio/) just before the election.

For the time being, [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/) sails on. The ARA Libertad recently [pulled into](https://www.wbaltv.com/article/argentinian-naval-ship-fells-point-free-tours-deck/68991542) [Baltimore](https://www.baltimorecity.gov/)’s harbor, following stops in [Costa Rica](https://puravidadigital.gob.go.cr/) and [Portugal](https://www.portugal.gov.pt/pt/gc25). I could hardly tell it was the same [Argentine](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/) naval ship caught up in an African port standoff over a decade ago. Sailors invited the public aboard to survey its towering old-school masts and vintage cannons. Now rough seas are ahead for [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/) with no way of knowing how the country may get through them. With or without U.S. help, this chapter won’t end well unless [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/) can chart its own path ahead.

| [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/) Gamblers|
|---|
| [Discovery Capital Management / Global Macro Hedge Fund / Rob Citrone / $2.6B AUM](https://www.discoverycp.com/) (Rob Citrone) Citrone has made large bets on [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/)’s sovereign debt and equities tied to Milei’s economic program. He increased his positions just before the bailout announcement and reportedly earned returns above 20% this year. |
| [Investment Management & Financial Services / BlackRock](https://www.blackrock.com/) One of the largest asset managers globally, [BlackRock](https://www.blackrock.com/) holds substantial [Argentine](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/) bond positions. Their exposure makes them a direct beneficiary of the bailout’s stabilizing effect. |
| [Fidelity Investments](https://www.fidelity.com/) [Fidelity](https://www.fidelity.com/) is also heavily invested in [Argentine](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/) debt. Their holdings are part of the broader private ownership of [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/)’s upcoming $8.5 billion in bond payments. |
| [Pimco (Pacific Investment Management Company)](https://www.pimco.com/) [Pimco](https://www.pimco.com/), known for its bond strategies, has significant exposure to [Argentine](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/) sovereign debt. The bailout helps protect their returns. |
| Stanley Druckenmiller Another billionaire investor with ties to [Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) and [Soros Fund Management](https://sorosfundmgmt.com/), Druckenmiller reportedly holds [Argentine](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/) assets and benefits from the bailout’s timing. |
| [Senda Digital Assets](https://www.senda.fund/) ([Tania Reif](https://www.linkedin.com/in/taniareif/)) Though smaller, this fund is notable because its founder, [Tania Reif](https://www.linkedin.com/in/taniareif/), is partnered with [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/)’s Deputy Economy Minister José Luis Daza. [Reif](https://www.linkedin.com/in/taniareif/) previously worked under [Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) at [Soros Fund Management](https://sorosfundmgmt.com/), specializing in emerging market strategies. |
