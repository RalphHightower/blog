Instead of helping one individual, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) should restore funding to the [National Institutes of Health (HIH)](https://www.nih.gov/) that [Elon Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk), with his script kiddies in [Department if Government Efficiency (DOGE)](https://doge.gov/) and [Robert F Kennedy Jr](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html ) slashed and burned.

## [Cancer is bigger than cartoonist Scott Adams. President Trump ought to act like it.](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/dilbert-cartoonist-cancer-kaiser-trump-rcna241914)

*[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) told [Scott Adams](https://scottadams.locals.com/) he was 'On it!' But what about all the other cancer patients he's disregarded with cuts to medical research funding?*

Nov. 4, 2025, 5:25 PM EST
By [Jarvis DeBerry](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jarvis-deberry-ncpn1277413)

The latest proof that [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) sees himself as more of a king than a [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)? [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) leaped to the aid of a celebrity supporter who couldn’t get a cancer treatment scheduled, but he has to be forced to fund the program that helps more than 40 million people eat — and is willing to do that only partially. A king, of course, dispenses favors to whomever he chooses. A [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is supposed to faithfully execute the laws of the United States, but a federal judge said last week that [the Trump administration’s plan to not fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program was “unlawful.”](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/federal-judge-orders-trump-administration-pay-snap-benefits-contingenc-rcna241187)

On a weekend when so many people were wondering when they’d next be able to eat, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) world reacted like it was an emergency when [“Dilbert” cartoonist Scott Adams](https://scottadams.locals.com/) posted about his inability to get [Kaiser Permanente of Northern California](https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/northern-california/) to immediately schedule him for a cancer treatment. “[Going to make sure that my dad sees this](https://x.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1984975595365655004),” [Donald Trump Jr.n](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donald-trump-jr-4454b862/) responded on X to [Adams](https://scottadams.locals.com/)’ request for the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s help. Next came a reply from [Health and Human Services Secretary](https://www.hhs.gov/) [Robert F. Kennedy Jr.](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html): “[Scott](https://scottadams.locals.com/). How do I reach you? [The President wants to help.](https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1985016350549385684)” Then the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) himself wrote on social media, “On it!”

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) world reacted like it was an emergency when [“Dilbert” cartoonist Scott Adams](https://scottadams.locals.com/) posted about his inability to get [Kaiser Permanente of Northern California](https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/northern-california/) to immediately schedule him for a cancer treatment.

[Adams](https://scottadams.locals.com/), who says he has prostate cancer that has metastasized to his bones, posted Monday that he was scheduled to have his treatment today. “For context,” he wrote, “I waited months for the drug, like everyone else. But I think my files got misplaced or something and that glitch just got corrected. Not sure.”

[Kaiser](https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/northern-california/) [said in a statement](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/11/03/nx-s1-5596478/dilbert-trump-cancer-drug-rfk-jr), “[Mr. Adams](https://scottadams.locals.com/)’ oncology team is working closely with him on the next steps in his cancer care, which are already underway.”

There’s a long list of reasons to dislike [Adams](https://scottadams.locals.com/) — including [past racist](https://www.npr.org/2023/02/26/1159580425/newspapers-have-dropped-the-dilbert-comic-strip-after-a-racist-rant-by-its-creat) and [misogynistic comments](https://web.archive.org/web/20220822171610/https:/www.scottadamssays.com/selling-past-the-close/) — but his using every tool at his disposal to try to extend his life is not among them. The problem lies with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s priorities. Although he moved to help [Adams](https://scottadams.locals.com/), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s other actions suggest he sees money for cancer research as wasteful. As [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) reported last month, not only has the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) “canceled hundreds of millions of dollars in cancer-related research grants and contracts,” the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s proposed budget for next year “calls for [a more-than-37-percent cut to the National Cancer Institute](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/14/magazine/cancer-research-grants-funds-trump.html?login=smartlock&auth=login-smartlock) — the [N.I.H.](https://www.nih.gov/) agency that leads most of the nation’s cancer research — reducing it to \$4.5 billion from \$7.2 billion.”

A [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) doesn’t show a commitment to fighting cancer by singling out one fan who has a scheduling difficulty. (“On it!”) A [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) shows a commitment to fighting cancer by funding the medical research that will help the country as a whole.

If the fight against cancer is to be won, it will require a systematic approach. It won’t be won by doling out favors.
