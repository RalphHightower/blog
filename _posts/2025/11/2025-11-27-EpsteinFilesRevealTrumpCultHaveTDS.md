## [Epstein’s emails reveal the true definition of ‘Trump derangement syndrome’](https://www.ms.now/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-jeffrey-epstein-emails-bill-maher-venezuela-war-rcna244036)

*The real “[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) derangement syndrome” is looking at the Epstein emails, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s graft and U.S. warships in the Caribbean and saying, “There’s nothing there.”*

Nov. 16, 2025, 6:00 AM EST
By Anthony L. Fisher

[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s reflexive defenders lazily rely on the phrase “[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) derangement syndrome” (TDS) as both a schoolyard taunt and a blanket pardon for any fact-based criticism of the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). But the level of mass denial many of them exhibited this week is actually deranged.

A number of the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s die-hard supporters, as well as some [non-MAGA fellow travelers](https://www.ms.now/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-politically-tribeless-maga-centrists-yada-rcna174109) and contrarian apologists, demonstrated an uncanny ability to use a “Jedi mind trick” on themselves. Just as in the original “Star Wars” film, when Obi-Wan Kenobi befuddles an imperial storm trooper by waving his fingers and saying, “These aren’t the droids you’re looking for,” these folks saw real-life evidence [of corruption](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/dont-know-trump-struggles-defend-one-scandalous-pardons-rcna241547) and [warmongering](https://www.ms.now/news/exclusive-dozens-killed-us-boat-strikes-remain-unidentified-rcna242339), as well as [potentially incriminating emails released by the Jeffrey Epstein estate](https://www.ms.now/news/epstein-emails-trump-conspiracy-theories-rcna243722), and collectively told themselves, “There’s nothing there.”

> **It’s not just members of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s far-right tinfoil hat base who see one thing and decide the opposite is true.**

Upon the release this week of emails from the late convicted sex offender Epstein to his co-conspirator, the convicted child sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell, including one that made curious references to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) — such as “that dog that hasn’t barked is trump” — several highly influential conspiracy theorists from the “Pizzagate” wing of MAGA world declared the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) completely vindicated.

As my colleague [Brandy Zadrozny reported](https://www.ms.now/msnbc/news/epstein-emails-trump-conspiracy-theories-rcna243722): “It’s not the first time in recent months that newly unearthed writings have suggested [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and Epstein shared closer ties than the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has acknowledged. [In July,](https://www.wsj.com/politics/trump-jeffrey-epstein-birthday-letter-we-have-certain-things-in-common-f918d796?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqc2bk52ZF5Z6l7M5uqcpgUovdchiiPAoi6hQZLy7a7kY4tS3szkjRWos-TFerg%3D&gaa_ts=6915d304&gaa_sig=A9aGDxiGmgw0ZCwBmkcShmjmkwPirKXpyyh6LYg-HkiZCI0JXFe_ZFnmvKElAubI_bavIIz5LO-vVQ2yGJL3XA%3D%3D), The [Wall Street Journal](https;//www.wsj.com/) reported on a 2003 [birthday card](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/09/08/us/trump-news#epstein-trump-birthday-book) from [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to Epstein. The card contained a cryptic message wrapped in an illustration of a naked woman, drawn in bold black marker, about having ‘certain things in common,’ which offered in closing, ‘may every day be another wonderful secret.’ [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) denies authoring the note and has sued the Journal over the story.”

It’s not just members of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s far-right tinfoil hat base who see one thing and decide the opposite is true.

The [Trump-curious liberal comic Bill Maher](https://www.ms.now/opinion/msnbc-opinion/bill-maher-larry-david-op-ed-satire-hitler-rcna203573), on his podcast “Club Random” this week, gushed to actress and MAHA queen Cheryl Hines that he appreciates that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) “really, really does not like war.” In [a viral clip from the interview](https://x.com/JasonJournoDC/status/1987906828252901640), Maher talks about how, during his [infamous White House dinner with the president](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bill-maher-dinner-trump_n_69124939e4b0b840aac1615a) with the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) told him how affected he was by seeing raw footage of war carnage in [Ukraine](https://www.kmu.gov.ua/). Despite [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s absurd and untrue boasts about stopping several wars, [Maher](https://billmaher.com/) insisted, “It’s still good that we’re solving them and not starting them.”

[Maher](https://billmaher.com/)’s not a dumb guy, so maybe he’s too busy hosting his [HBO](https://www.hbo.com/) show or [possibly getting drunk](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPtu9LMDT8E/) and [stoned on his podcast](https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/bill-maher-rejected-steve-o-interview-pot-smoking-1236007910/) (as is his wont) to notice that in addition to ordering extralegal killings of suspected narcotics traffickers, the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has sent [the world’s largest warship](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/12/trump-caribbean-warships-venezuela-conflict) to the Caribbean [as senior officials mull a U.S. military attack on Venezuela](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-venezuela-military-options/). And as my colleague [Steve Benen)(https://www.ms.now/author/steve-benen) noted last month, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) in his second term has also already “launched [preemptive military strikes](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/one-day-strikes-iran-trumps-totally-obliterated-claims-come-question-rcna214448) on targets in [Iran](https://irangov.ir/); initiated [a bombing campaign in Yemen;](https://apnews.com/article/trump-houthis-end-of-bombing-yemen-israel-e2f08ac04024ef3d6409b4ce97092489); announced his desire to annex [Canada, Greenland, the Panama Canal and the Gaza Strip;](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/multiple-fronts-trump-ups-ante-territorial-ambitions-rcna196403); and spoken publicly about possibly [returning U.S. troops to Afghanistan](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-saber-rattles-two-countries-apparently-giving-nobel-peace-prize-rcna232935).”

And then there’s the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s shameless, enormous level of graft during his second term, including but hardly limited to accepting a \$400 million jet from the [government of Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) as a personal gift and [the billions of dollars his family has acquired](https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/trump-family-amasses-6-billion-fortune-after-crypto-launch-567faec5?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqdpDB4Ee_oYucPkeUyp3-_JrByHCwelx6rUjf-f81OvDPXsvxessO0bO3U_FH0%3D&gaa_ts=69179191&gaa_sig=f0ByhlVcDeHXkoDKH_m5ycggHtwazNYHXxFjypVYACdpoj3eaXAqW_XUazDVFWnOqIFh7iwjPUwYPOxoBu6PQQ%3D%3D) from launching its own cryptocurrency — all while [he dismantles government watchdog and anti-corruption units](https://www.reuters.com/investigations/how-trump-defanged-justice-departments-political-corruption-watchdogs-2025-06-09/?).

> **[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has always relied on the gullibility of strangers, but this week showed how committed [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s supporters and sympathetic whataboutists are to not admitting what they see.**

The [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/)’s opinion page — [recently rechristened](https://x.com/JeffBezos/status/1894757287052362088?s=20) as a bastion of “pro-America” and pro-free-market orthodoxy — featured an op-ed by Zachary Karabell this week which [essentially argued](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/11/13/trump-graft-democracy-chester-arthur/) that because there was rampant corruption in the federal government in the late 1800s and American democracy survived, there’s no reason to believe that the increasingly lawless [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) “is an existential threat to democracy.” Karabell writes, “It may be distasteful, possibly even illegal. But there is a wide chasm between illegal, immoral or corrupt and the end of freedom, civil society and democracy as we know it. There is a massive gulf between the thought-control of Pyongyang and [TrumpCoin](https://gettrumpmemes.com/).”

In a case of missing the forest for the trees, the egregious personal enrichment of the billionaire [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and his family isn’t necessarily an existential threat to democracy. But because he has already attempted a self-coup after losing an election, and because he has allied himself with [democracy skeptics](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/18/magazine/curtis-yarvin-interview.html) and some of the richest people in the world — enriching their businesses with government contracts along the way — [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s self-dealing could certainly be included in the basket of threats to the future of the republic.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has always relied on the gullibility of strangers (e.g., the glossy TV sheen of the “The Apprentice” convincing many Americans that a real estate magnate best known for his extravagant failures is actually a business genius), but this week showed how committed [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s supporters and sympathetic whataboutists are to not admitting what they see. With the confidence of Obi-Wan Kenobi, they tell themselves that the scandals staring them in their face aren’t scandals at all — and that everyone else is deranged to think they are.
