## [The disturbing precursor to Team Trump’s offensive against Sen. Mark Kelly](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/the-disturbing-precursor-to-team-trumps-offensive-against-sen-mark-kelly)

*The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) appears to have revived his first-term impulse to recall veteran critics to active duty for courts-martial.*

Nov. 25, 2025, 8:58 AM EST
By [Steve Benen](https://www.ms.now/author/steve-benen)

Initially, the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) was content to target the [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [military](https://www.jcs.mil/) [veterans](https://www.va.gov/) who urged service members to [reject illegal orders](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-house-targets-democratic-veterans-told-troops-refuse-illegal-ord-rcna244954) with [vituperative rhetoric](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/old-days-was-death-trump-rages-democratic-military-veterans-rcna245165). Indeed, [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) personally helped lead the charge, insisting that the [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)ic veterans had engaged in “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”

On Monday, however, the campaign took on a new dimension when [Defense](https://www.defense.gov/) [Secretary Pete Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) [announced an investigation](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/pete-hegseth-investigationmark-kelly) into [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Mark Kelly of Arizona](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/), a decorated [Navy](https://www.navy.mil/) [veteran](https://www.va.gov/), with the [Pentagon](https://www.defense.gov/) claiming in a statement that it had “received serious allegations of misconduct” against the lawmaker.

There may be “allegations,” but characterizing them as “serious” was a stretch. All [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/) did was remind service members to follow the law and the [Uniform Code of Military Justice](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCODE-2024-title10/USCODE-2024-title10-subtitleA-partII-chap47). (It led [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/)’s [Rex Huppke](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/6878775001/rex-huppke/) to note [in his latest column](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2025/11/24/pentagon-mark-kelly-sedition-trump-troops/87454436007/?tbref=hp), “Telling people to obey the law is a crime in the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/).”)

What’s more, the [Defense Department](https://www.defense.gov/)’s statement warned that its investigation “may include recall to active duty for court-martial proceedings,” a point [Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) [reemphasized via social media](https://x.com/PeteHegseth/status/1993295993321009570) on Tuesday morning [in an unfortunate missive](https://bsky.app/profile/brendannyhan.bsky.social/post/3m6hgraowac2m).

And that reminded me of a story.

Gen. Stanley McChrystal retired as a four-star general [in 2010](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/24/us/24mcchrystal.html), following a lengthy and decorated military career. At that point, McChrystal was free to speak his mind as a private citizen, and he became tangentially involved in [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) politics.

Four years later, Adm. William McRaven, perhaps best known to Americans as the [Navy](https://www.navy.mil/) [SEAL](https://www.navy.com/careers-benefits/careers/special-operations/navy-seal) who oversaw the 2011 raid that killed Osama bin Laden, also retired after a similarly celebrated military career. He, too, became free to share his political perspective, and despite his conservative ideology, McRaven became one of the nation’s [most eloquent Trump](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/admiral-bin-laden-raid-endorses-biden-dramatic-fashion-n1243990).

According to a book by former [Defense](https://www.defense.gov/) Secretary Mark Esper, as [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) became aware of their attitudes, he privately condemned the men as “[disloyal](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/esper-trump-wanted-to-activate-retired-four-stars-to-court-martial-them-for-disloyalty).” More to the point, the Republican [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) also said he said [he wanted to court-martial McChrystal and McRaven](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/05/11/esper-book-trump-mchrystal-mcraven/) because they said things about him that hurt his feelings.

In other words, in the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s first term, he wanted to court-martial retired military heroes for saying things he didn’t like, and in his second term, [Team Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has raised the possibility of court-martialing another retired military hero for saying things [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) didn’t like.

For its part, the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has publicly endorsed [Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/)’s campaign against [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/), with press secretary [Karoline Leavitt telling reporters](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3m6fogasckn2t) on Monday that she believes the Arizonan was “actually trying” to “intimidate” active-duty troops. Why the troops would be intimidated by a senator urging them to follow the law is unclear.

Leavitt went on to describe the [Uniform Code of Military Justice](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCODE-2024-title10/USCODE-2024-title10-subtitleA-partII-chap47) in ways [that were the opposite of the truth](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3m6fnz6xcc32z).

As for [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/), the senator sat down with [Rachel Maddow](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/rachel-maddow-biography-n1157621) on Monday night, described the message he delivered in last week’s video as “pretty simple and noncontroversial” and made clear that the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s efforts to silence him are not going to work.
