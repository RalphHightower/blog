## [Frustration mounts in FBI over thwarted ‘potential’ terror plot](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/fbi-terror-plot-detroit-rcna241148)

*Senior officials believe [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Director Kash Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) acted hastily in attempt to grab credit.*

Oct. 31, 2025, 1:32 PM EDT
By Ken Dilanian and Carol Leonnig

Senior [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) and [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) officials expressed frustration Friday that [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Director Kash Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) publicly disclosed an investigation into what he called a “potential” Halloween weekend terrorist plot near [Detroit](https://www.heredetroitmi.com/government/) — before investigators had a chance to flesh out key details, including whether the attack actually was imminent, two people familiar with the matter told [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/).

At 7:32 am Friday, [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) posted on X: “This morning the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) thwarted a potential terrorist attack and arrested multiple subjects in [Michigan](https://www.michigan.gov/) who were allegedly plotting a violent attack over Halloween weekend. More details to come.”

[Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) officials registered concern that [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) appeared to have acted hastily on the probe without [Main Justice](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/)’s approval, with the apparent goal of seeking some credit for the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/), but in a way that could interfere with the investigation, according to the sources. [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) has not named them as they fear retaliation.

The alleged plot involved a group of young people, some of whom are minors, who had been engaging online with Islamic extremist content. But the sources said the investigation was in its early stages, with no criminal charges prepared and no clear understanding of what exactly the suspects planned to do and where.

In the hours since [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s tweet, the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) has not revealed any further details about the case, and no public documents have been filed.

[Michigan](https://www.michigan.gov/)’s [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [Attorney General](https://www.michigan.gov/ag), [Dana Nessel](https://www.michigan.gov/ag/team-listing-page/attorney-general-dana-nessel), said during a public appearance that she is “very grateful for the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) work in protecting the community.”

Today’s public declaration by [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) harkened to posts on X in September when he hailed that law enforcement had arrested a subject in the [Charlie Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/) assassination; hours later it was found to be a premature claim, with law enforcement realizing after questioning the person that they had no link to the case.

[Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s announcement also came as he has been under fire for his use of the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) jet for personal trips, including what flight records showed was a flight by an [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Gulfstream](https://www.gulfstream.com/en/) jet last week to State College, [Pennsylvania](https://www.pa.gov/), where his country singer girlfriend, [Alexis Wilkins](https://www.alexiswilkins.com/), was performing, and then to Nashville, where she lives.

Ken Dilanian is the justice and intelligence correspondent for [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/).

Carol Leonnig is a senior investigative reporter with [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/). Previously an investigative reporter with the Washington Post, she is a four-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize.
