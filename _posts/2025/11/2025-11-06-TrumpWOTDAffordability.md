title: "Trump’s WOTD (Word Of The Day): “Affordability”"
---

Today's "Word of the Day" comes, not from [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/), but from [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). All during his third campaign, he promised to lower the price of "the grocery"[sic].

@RalphHightower: The correct use should be "lower the price of groceries".

## [Trump makes an overdue discovery: ‘They have this new word called 'affordability'](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-makes-overdue-discovery-new-word-called-affordability-rcna242345)

*After [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) scored election victories, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) started talking about “affordability.” Unfortunately, his assessment is rooted in nonsense.*

Nov. 6, 2025, 10:58 AM EST
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

[Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) spent years publishing assorted messages to the social media platform formerly known as [Twitter](https://x.com/), but he [literally never](https://x.com/search?q=from%3A%40realDonaldTrump%20affordability&src=typed_query&f=live) wrote a tweet that included the word “affordability.”

On his own platform, however, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has taken a sudden interest in the term.

On Tuesday morning, as Election Day 2025 got underway, he [wrote online](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115491996994152487), “If affordability is you [sic] issue, VOTE [REPUBLICAN](https://www.gop.com/)! Energy costs, as and [sic] example, are plummeting.” (In reality, [energy costs are climbing](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/energy-prices-trump-expects-voters-fall-foolish-lie-twice-rcna239369), not sinking.)

The day after [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)ic election victories, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [assured the public](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115497796099239673), “Affordability is our goal.” That was followed by a related [online rant](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115503140217634129): “2025 Thanksgiving dinner under [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is 25% lower than 2024 Thanksgiving dinner under [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/), according to [Walmart](https://www.wakmart.com/). My cost [sic] are lower than the [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) on everything, especially oil and gas! So the [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) [sic] ‘affordability’ issue is DEAD! STOP LYING!!!”

Whether the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) understands this or not, [Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/) [lowered the cost](https://meidasnews.com/news/community-note-roasts-trumps-walmart-thanksgiving-inflation-spin) of its Thanksgiving dinner by reducing the number of items included in the package and replacing brand-name products with value products. It was not, in other words, the result of the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s awesomeness.

@RalphHightower: "Shrinkflation" (def): the practice of reducing a product's amount or volume per unit while continuing to offer it at the same price.

As for the idea that the underlying issue is “dead,” the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) seems to know better. Consider his exchange with [Bret Baier](https://www.foxnews.com/person/b/bret-baier) during the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)’s [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) interview Wednesday night.

Assessing the broader political and economic landscape, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said he’s succeeded in bringing energy costs “way down.” ([That’s the opposite of the truth.](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/energy-prices-trump-expects-voters-fall-foolish-lie-twice-rcna239369)) He added that the cost of groceries is also “way down.” ([That, too, was a lie.](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-weird-claims-grocery-prices-are-self-defeating-lies-rcna239338)) As part of the harangue, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) insisted that inflation rates during [Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/)’s term were “the highest ... in the history of our country.” ([That’s ridiculous](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/04/us/trump-speech-congress/as-you-know-we-inherited-from-the-last-administration-an-economic-catastrophe-and-an-inflation-nightmare?smid=url-share.))

But perhaps the most striking part of the interview was [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) saying, “You know, they have this new word called ‘affordability’ and [[Republicans](https://www.gop.com/)] don’t talk about it enough. The [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) did.”

For now, let’s not dwell on the fact that “affordability” [is not a “new word.”](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/affordability) Instead, let’s consider the merit of the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s analysis.

By [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s reasoning, [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) officials and candidates have struggled because they haven’t talked about the cost-of-living challenges facing American consumers. That might make him feel better, but the underlying issue isn’t rhetorical, it’s practical.

[Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) can use “this new word” all the time and it won’t change the fact the party, with total control over federal policymaking, has failed spectacularly to address one of the key issues that elevated them to power in the first place.

[Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) scored election victories, not by mentioning “affordability,” but by shining a light on the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/)’s substantive failures on the issue and offering an alternative.

The longer [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) fails to understand this, the more often he and his party will suffer political and electoral consequences.
