Black Hawk helicopters. Agents rappelling from helicopters. Kicking down doors. Trashing apartments. Apartment residents separated by doing color. Children separated from their parents.

## [Attorney General Alan Wilson leads defense of Trump’s deployment of National Guard to Chicago - South Carolina Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/news/attorney-general-alan-wilson-leads-defense-of-trump-s-deployment-of-national-guard-to-chicago/)

NOV 12, 2025

([COLUMBIA](https://www.columbiasc.gov/), [S.C.](https://www.sc.gov/)) - [South Carolina](https://www.sc.gov/) [Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/) [Alan Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general) co-led a [coalition of state attorneys general](https://republicanags.com/) in filing an emergency legal brief backing [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s lawful deployment of the [National Guard](https://www.nationalguard.mil/) to [Chicago](https://www.chicago.gov/) to protect federal officers and federal property. The [22 states](https://republicanags.com/) filed a friend-of-the-court brief with the [Supreme Court of the United States](https://www.suprrmecourt.gov/), asking it to lift a stay by the [U.S. District Court for Northern Illinois](https://www.ilnd.uscourts.gov/), which blocked the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) from sending the [National Guard](https://www.nationalguard.mil/) there.

[Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/) [Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general) says it’s in [South Carolina](https://www.sc.gov/)’s interest to support [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s efforts to enforce immigration policy because our state has been flooded with illegal drugs and violent gang members from other countries who come into the U.S. across our southern border.

“[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is simply enforcing federal immigration law that [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) passed,” [Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/) [Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general) said. “But activists have gathered in [Chicago](https://www.chicago.gov/) to protest, sometimes violently, and have threatened federal officers and harmed federal property. [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s order to send in a small number of [National Guard](https://www.nationalguard.mil/) members to defend against this lawlessness is responsible, constitutional, and authorized by law.”

In their brief, the attorneys general note that [Immigration and Customs Enforcement](https://www.ice.gov/)’s Broadview Processing Center in [Chicago](https://www.chicago.gov/) has faced violence and unlawful activity by rioters. “More than one hundred people have surrounded the Center and ‘assaulted law enforcement, threw tear gas cans, slashed tires of cars, blocked the entrance of the building, and trespassed on private property,’” they write. But the threat that [ICE agents](https://www.ice.gov/) face in [Chicago](https://www.chicago.gov/) is not limited to that one location, as [ICE agents](https://www.ice.gov/) were attacked and rammed by vehicles while on patrol 15 miles from the Broadview Center.

[Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/) [Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general) co-led the amicus brief with the attorneys general of [Iowa](https://www.iowaattorneygeneral.gov/), [Montana](https://ago.mo.gov/), and [Oklahoma](https://oklahoma.gov/oag.html). Joining them were the states of [Alabama](https://www.alabamaag.gov/), [Alaska](https://law.alaska.gov/), [Arkansas](https://arkansasag.gov/), [Florida](https://www.myfloridalegal.com/), [Georgia](https://law.georgia.gov/), [Idaho](https://www.ag.idaho.gov/), [Indiana](https://www.in.gov/attorneygeneral/), [Kansas](https://www.ag.ks.gov/home), [Kentucky](https://ag.ky.gov/Pages/default.aspx), [Louisiana](https://ag.louisiana.gov/), [Mississippi](https://attorneygenerallynnfitch.com/), [Missouri](https://ago.mo.gov/), [Nebraska](https://ago.nebraska.gov/), [North Dakota](https://attorneygeneral.nd.gov/), [Ohio](https://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/), [South Dakota](https://atg.sd.gov/#gsc.tab=0), [Texas](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/), and [West Virginia](https://ago.wv.gov/).
