## [‘The stupidity is unbelievable’: Nicolle Wallace slams Lindsey Halligan over leaked texts](https://www.ms.now/top-stories/latest/lindsey-halligan-trump-jeaopardy-text-lawfare-rcna239210)

*The ["Deadline: White House"](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house) host said [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/)'s reported behavior could be enough to get her "called into the principal’s office."*

By [Allison Detzel](https://www.ms.now/author/allison-detzel)

[Donald Trump’](https://www.ms.now/donald-trump)’s handpicked U.S. attorneys appear to be under threat. On Monday, a federal appeals court considered whether [Alina Habba](https://www.ms.now/top-stories/latest/alina-habba-us-attorney-new-jersey-ruling-rcna226441), the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s former personal lawyer, is unlawfully serving as the acting [U.S. attorney in New Jersey](https://www.justice.gov/usao-nj).

A ruling against the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) could have huge implications for several of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s appointments across the country, including in the [Eastern District of Virginia](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/), where he named [Lindsey Halligan](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/comey-lindsey-halligan-doj-expedited-ruling-rejected-rcna238954) as top prosecutor.

Since taking the job late last month, [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/), who also served as a former personal lawyer for the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), has filed high-profile cases against former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Director](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) [James Comey](https://www.ms.now/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-doj-comey-james-bolton-indictments-rcna238195) and [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) [Attorney General](https://ag.ny.gov/) [Letitia James.](https://www.ms.now/opinion/msnbc-opinion/letitia-james-indictment-jury-trump-enemies-rcna236932).

On Tuesday’s [“Deadline: White House”](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house), [Nicolle Wallace](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/nicolle-wallace-biography-n1157571) reacted to the [Habbe](https://www.justice.gov/usao-nj/meet-us-attorney) hearing and the possible domino effect it could have on [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s retribution efforts. [Wallace](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/nicolle-wallace-biography-n1157571) said the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s “reckless campaign to wreck the rule of law” was now “wobbling a bit like a Jenga tower that got a little too tall.”

[Wallace](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/nicolle-wallace-biography-n1157571) said that the “two pillars of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s retribution campaign,” the cases against [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) and [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james), are on the verge of collapsing because the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) “hastily put inexperienced loyalists in the positions of U.S. attorneys without any regard for the law.”

However, as [Wallace](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/nicolle-wallace-biography-n1157571) noted, the [Habbe](https://www.justice.gov/usao-nj/meet-us-attorney) appeal [isn’t the only threat](https://www.ms.now/katy-tur/watch/u-s-attorney-lindsey-halligan-sent-journalist-texts-about-letitia-james-indictment-lawfare-250320965935) to [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/)’s appointment, which she argued “might be in danger even before any court rules.” The [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) host pointed to a new report from [Anna Bower at Lawfare](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/anna--lindsey-halligan-here), who shared a [Signal](https://signal.org/) exchange she had with [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) regarding the grand jury in the New York attorney general’s case.

According to Bower, [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) had contacted her to complain about an X post, in which the [Lawfare](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/) reporter posted a summary of recent reporting from [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/us/politics/letitia-james-indictment-house.html) on the case. During their exchange, Bower said [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) sent messages that “touched on grand jury matters, even as she insisted that she could not reveal such information, which is protected from disclosure by prosecutors under federal law.”

“I don’t know whether to deal with the legal issues or the stupidity first,” [Wallace](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/nicolle-wallace-biography-n1157571) said. “But the stupidity is just unbelievable here.” The [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) host said that while [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) may “legitimately not understand” on-the-record versus off-the-record conversations with a journalist, discussing grand jury matters with anyone outside of the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) was unacceptable.

“Sharing grand jury information, to me, seems like something that even in this bizarre [Earth 2 world](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/watch/nicolle-gap-between-earth-1-and-earth-2-on-full-display-as-garland-defends-doj-in-hearing-193401413841) could get [Lindsey Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) called into the principal’s office,” she said.
