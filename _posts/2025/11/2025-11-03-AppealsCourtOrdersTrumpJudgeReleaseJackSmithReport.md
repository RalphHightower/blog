## [Appeals court finds ‘undue delay’ in Cannon’s handling of litigation over Jack Smith report](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/judge-cannon-jack-smith-report-trump-undue-delay-rcna241707)

*A [judicial panel](https://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/node/5791) gave the [Florida judge](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/content/judge-aileen-m-cannon), who presided over [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s classified documents case, 60 more days to rule on long-pending release motions.*

Nov. 3, 2025, 6:04 PM EST
By [Jordan Rubin](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jordan-rubin-ncpn1301611)

Delay was [one of the features](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/judge-cannon-trump-classified-documents-trial-delay-rcna153453) of [U.S. District](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/) [Judge Aileen Cannon](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/content/judge-aileen-m-cannon)’s handling of the [classified documents case](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/jack-smith-classified-documents-florida-aileen-cannon-rcna240017) in [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/). That theme continues even after she [dismissed the case](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/cannon-nixon-trump-case-dismissed-rcna161936) last year, because she hasn’t ruled on long-pending motions seeking the release of [special counsel Jack Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith)’s report on the matter, [which she blocked in January](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/-judge-cannon-blocks-trump-classified-documents-report-congress-rcna188534).

On Monday, the [federal appeals court](https://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/node/5791) that covers [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/) issued an order putting [Cannon](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/content/judge-aileen-m-cannon) on a two-month clock to rule. In a [one-page order](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca11.93247/gov.uscourts.ca11.93247.11.0.pdf), a [three-judge panel](https://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/node/5791) noted that the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-[appointed trial judge](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/content/judge-aileen-m-cannon) has had release motions pending before her months, but that she “has not ruled or conducted any other further proceedings on the pending motions.”

The [panel](https://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/node/5791) said that amounted to “undue delay” and gave the [judge](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/content/judge-aileen-m-cannon) 60 more days to rule.

[American Oversight](https://americanoversight.org/american-oversight-petitions-court-to-vacate-judge-cannons-gag-order-blocking-release-of-special-counsel-report-on-trump/) and the [Knight First Amendment Institute](https://knightcolumbia.org/content/knight-institute-seeks-immediate-release-of-special-counsels-report-on-trumps-mishandling-of-classified-documents) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/content/) have been pressing for release of [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith)’s report.

Depending on what [Cannon](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/content/judge-aileen-m-cannon) eventually decides, the issue could wind up back on appeal at the circuit court that had [previously reversed](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/judge-aileen-cannon-trump-classified-documents-case-rcna140020) her handling of the documents litigation before [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was charged. After [Cannon](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/content/judge-aileen-m-cannon) dismissed the case last year [on the grounds](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/aileen-cannon-dismisses-trump-classified-documents-case-rcna161879) that [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) was unlawfully appointed, he appealed to the circuit court but, before the court ruled on [Cannon](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/content/judge-aileen-m-cannon)’s dismissal, he [withdrew the appeal](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/jack-smith-drops-appeal-trump-classified-docs-case-rcna181687) after [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) won the 2024 election, citing the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/)’s policy against prosecuting sitting presidents.
