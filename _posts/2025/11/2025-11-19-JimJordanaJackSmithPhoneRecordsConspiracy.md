## [Jim Jordan demands telecom records in effort to prop up a Jack Smith conspiracy theory](https://www.ms.now/top-stories/latest/jim-jordan-jan-6-verizon-att-toll-records-rcna242167)

*The [Ohio Republican](https://jordan.house.gov/) is demanding documents from phone companies to support debunked allegations that the special counsel spied on [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/).*

Nov. 5, 2025, 2:51 PM EST
By [Ja'han Jones](https://www.ms.now/author/jahan-jones)

[Republicans](https://www.gop.com/)’ probe into bogus allegations of anti-conservative “spying” during the [Biden administration](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) advanced Tuesday as [House Judiciary](https://judiciary.house.gov/) [Chair](http://judiciary.house.gov/the-committee/the-chairman) [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Jim Jordan (T-OH4)](https://jordan.house.gov/), is demanding answers from phone companies [Verizon](https://www.verizon.com/) and [AT&T](https://www.att.com/).

The allegations center on [former special counsel Jack Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith)’s investigation of [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his allies’ attempt to unlawfully overturn his [2020 election loss](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf). Specifically, the claims concern [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith)’s choice to subpoena some [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/)’ phone toll records — data that crucially does not include the actual substance of any conversations. My colleague [Steve Benen](https://www.ms.now/author/steve-benen) [wrote an excellent explainer](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/january-6-fbi-republican-conspiracy-theory-rcna236367) last month about how the claims have already unraveled, both because there’s no evidence [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) or his team did snoop on those conversations and because the idea of [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) lawmakers’ communications coming up in an investigation into a [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s attempts to overturn his election loss is hardly a stretch in the first place. [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) has [denied allegations of spying](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/us/politics/jack-smith-phone-records-republicans.html) and seems [quite eager to testify](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-seek-jack-smiths-testimony-former-special-counsel-plenty-s-rcna237737) about all of this in a public hearing.

And yet the effort to scrape together something to prop up the conspiracy theory continues apace.

[Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/) sent letters to executives at [Verizon](https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2025-11-04-jdj-to-verizon-schulman-re-phone-records.pdf) and [AT&T](https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2025-11-04-jdj-to-at-t-stankey-re-phone-records.pdf) on Tuesday in which he claims that by complying with [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith)’s subpoenas and with a gag order from [federal Judge James Boasberg](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/chief-judge-james-e-boasberg) that barred them from notifying lawmakers that their toll records had been acquired, the companies “raise concerns about potential statutory and constitutional violations, including violations of the Speech or Debate clause.”

[Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/)’s letter demands documents from both companies related to [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith)’s subpoenas, any other documents concerning the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/)’s subpoenas and requests for information related to the [Jan. 6 investigation]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}), and any documents that outline employees’ conversations with [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith)’s office.

Given abundant [examples](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/fbi-agents-tied-trump-investigations-are-fired-rcna241731) of [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) targeting anyone who has played a role in holding [Jan. 6 insurrectionists]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}) accountable, this obvious fishing expedition seems designed to relitigate the events of that day and portray as victims the members of the [pro-insurrectionist party](https://www.gop.com/).
