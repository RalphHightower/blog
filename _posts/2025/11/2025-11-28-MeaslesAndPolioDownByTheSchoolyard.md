This may not be one of Paul Simon’s most successful songs, but it was a fun vibe to work up at the start of a new school year – getting instruments out for the first time since a summer holiday. The original was the second single from the album “Paul Simon” (released 1972) and the inscrutable story in the lyrics is set in the Queens neighbourhood where he grew up. By coincidence, it was apparently performed with Stephen Colbert in 2015 on The Late Show – the programme that this week tore into Robert F. Kennedy Jr.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donald-trump-jr-4454b862/)’s record and showed some of his fiery testimony in the Senate, an episode which also made it into European news coverage (story here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c....

Needless to say, the world is watching with alarm the compromising of America’s public health systems, including the dismantling of the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) – which has now lost its chief medical officer, director of immunisation, and director of emerging diseases (among many others) - while misinformation spreads, rates of vaccine uptake plummet, new outbreaks of measles kill again, and some states gallop headlong towards removing mandates that had the overwhelming backing of the scientific and medical communities.

LYRICS:

There’s more melodrama rolling ahead
As a man without qualification
Shared a couple of doubts, put some bunkum out
Now he’s undermining vaccination!

RFK is sure
He used to work in law
With a hem and haw
He’s gonna end the cure

The medics looked round, saw the shit going down
And resigned or faced termination
The panel destroyed by conspiracy boy
Now they’re restricting who gets immunisation!

Hell, it’s RFK
He don’t know what he’s doing!
It’s RFK
He’s faking the science, so you’d best beware
Cos heaven knows: it’s not only Corona
We’ll see measles and polio down in the schoolyard
We’ll see measles and polio down in the schoolyard

WHOA!
Lots of roadkill affairs – like the thing with the bear
Had a heroin drug conviction
Got a worm in his brain
Hope the poor thing escaped
Cos it’s not a place you’d want to be trapped in

There’s a couple of ways, that when you hear what he says,
That you’d guess he’s more ‘quack’ than ‘geek’
First of the Health Secretaries who’s abetting disease
MMR’s now the lowest it has been

And you know who’ll pay?
The folk whose shots are going
As state by state
They’re claiming their ‘right’ to infection-share
Cos heaven knows: it’s not only Corona

We’ll see measles and polio down in the schoolyard
We’ll see flu and rubella down in the schoolyard
We’ll see varicella, down in the schoolyard
We’ll see hepatitis, down in the schoolyard
We’ll see parotitis, down in the schoolyard
