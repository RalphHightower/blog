## [As Pete Hegseth advances retaliatory investigation, Mark Kelly picks up GOP backing](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/as-pete-hegseth-advances-retaliatory-investigation-mark-kelly-picks-up-gop-backing)

*The [Pentagon](https://www.defense.gov/)’s meritless scrutiny of the [Arizona Democrat](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/) is moving forward. Even some [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) agree this is a misguided mistake.*

Nov. 26, 2025, 12:01 PM EST
By [Steve Benen](https://www.ms.now/author/steve-benen)

Nearly a week after several [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [military](https://www.jcs.mil/) [veterans](https://www.va.gov/) urged service members to [reject illegal orders](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-house-targets-democratic-veterans-told-troops-refuse-illegal-ord-rcna244954), [Defense](https://www.defense.gov/) [Secretary Pete Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) [announced an investigation](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/pete-hegseth-investigationmark-kelly), but only into one of the six members. [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Mark Kelly (D-AZ)](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/), a decorated [Navy](https://www.navy.mil/) [veteran](https://www.va.gov/), was the only member of the group who retired as a [captain](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/) and served long enough to receive a pension.

As a result, the [senator](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/) is not only still required to follow the [Uniform Code of Military Justice](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCODE-2024-title10/USCODE-2024-title10-subtitleA-partII-chap47), but he can also be punished in a variety of ways: The [Pentagon](https://www.defense.gov/) could lower his rank, target his pension or, as [Hegseth emphasized](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/the-disturbing-precursor-to-team-trumps-offensive-against-sen-mark-kelly) earlier this week, recall [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/) to active service in order to face a court-martial.

Of course, any of these steps would be ridiculous given the circumstances — all [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/) did was remind service members to follow the law and the [UCMJ](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCODE-2024-title10/USCODE-2024-title10-subtitleA-partII-chap47) — but the [Pentagon](https://www.defense.gov/)’s investigation is moving ahead anyway. The [defense secretary](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) on Tuesday gave the [Navy](https://www.navy.mil/) [secretary](https://www.navy.mil/Leadership/Flag-Officer-Biographies/BioDisplay/Article/4136042/the-honorable-john-phelan/) a [Dec. 10 deadline](https://x.com/DeptofWar/status/1993436056008507865) on the outcome of the review.

Over the course of the next two weeks, common sense suggests the matter will evaporate, in part because the senator didn’t do anything wrong, in part because building any kind of credible case against [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/) [would be practically impossible](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/trumps-case-against-senator-mark-kelly-faces-steep-hurdles-under-military-law-2025-11-26/) and in part because the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) likely knows that any effort to take the investigation to a more serious level would inevitably fail.

In the meantime, however, the [Arizonan](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/) is picking up some political support from unexpected sources: [congressional](https://www.congress.gov=) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/). [The Hill](https://thehill.com/) reported:

> *[Sens.](https://www.senate.gov/) [John Curtis (T-CO)](https://www.curtis.senate.gov/) and [Lisa Murkowski (T-AK)](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/) backed fellow [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Mark Kelly (D-AZ)](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/), amid a [Pentagon](https://www.defense.gov/) probe into ‘serious allegations of misconduct’ against the senator after he and five other [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) lawmakers told service members to disobey illegal orders from the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/).*

[Murkowski](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/), in particular, said in a statement, “To accuse him [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/) and other lawmakers of treason and sedition for rightfully pointing out that servicemembers can refuse illegal orders is reckless and flat-out wrong. … The [Department of Defense](https://www.defense.gov/) and [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) surely have more important priorities than this frivolous investigation.”

[Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Don Bacon (T-NE2)](https://bacon.house.gov/), an [Air Force](https://www.af.mil/) [veteran](https://www.va.gov/), offered mild criticisms of the [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/)ic [veteran](https://www.va.gov/)s’ video from last week — he called it “unnecessary” — but he went on to characterize the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s allegations as “crazy.”

Specifically referencing [Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/), [Bacon added](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5621596-don-bacon-pete-hegseth-mark-kelly-threats/?tbref=hp): “Amateur hour once again at the [Department of Defense](https://www.defense.gov/).”

As for the broader political implications, [Punchbowl News reported](https://punchbowl.news/article/senate/kelly-political-dod/) this week that [Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/)’s offensive against [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/) might ultimately prove to be a “political gift” for the Arizona [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/).

“A fundraising juggernaut, [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/) raised \$86.2 million for his 2022 reelection bid,” the report noted. “But a high-profile clash with the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) is sure to further juice contributions from a [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) base hungry for politicians more aggressively standing up to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).”
