title: "My Dumb State, South Carolina: Attorney General Alan Wilson Wants To Convict Federal Reserve Governor, Lisa Cook, Without a Trial"
---

In [Trump’s](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) America, one is presumed guilty until proven innocent. 

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is severely lacking in business acumen. 
1. He has bankrupted his [Trump Company](https://www.trump.com/)
2. Lost two casinos. How? When the house always wins?
3. Lost an airline. 
4. Lost a football team. 
5. Trump University was a scam.
6. Trump Foundation was a self-dealing sham charity.

[South Carolina](https://www.sc.gov) [Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/) [Alan Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general) ought to know better.

## [Attorney General Alan Wilson supports President Trump’s authority to remove bureaucrats - [South Carolina Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/news/attorney-general-alan-wilson-supports-president-trump-s-authority-to-remove-bureaucrats/)

NOV 03, 2025

(COLUMBIA, S.C.) – [South Carolina](https://www.sc.gov/) [Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/) [Alan Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general) joined [22 other states](https://republicanags.com/) in filing a friend-of-the-court brief supporting [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s authority to fire [Lisa Cook](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/cook.htm), [Governor of the Federal Reserve Board](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed.htm).

“I’m proud to stand with [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) in this case. I think the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/) and federal law give him the authority to fire her in these circumstances, and he is on solid ground in attempting to fire her for cause. At the end of the day, the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) gets to exercise executive power—not unelected bureaucrats,” [Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/) [Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general) said.

In October, the [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) ruled that [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) could not remove [Cook](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/cook.htm) from the [Board](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed.htm) immediately, saying the [Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) would hear arguments in January. The brief, signed by the [attorneys general of 22 states](https://republicanags.com/) and the [Arizona Legislature](https://www.azleg.gov/), asks the [Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) to allow the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) to remove her.

[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) says he can fire her for cause because he alleges [Cook](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/cook.htm) falsified records so she could get better mortgage terms before joining the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) in 2022.

The [states](https://republicanags.com/) argue in their brief that [Cook](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/cook.htm) is challenging a part of the [Federal Reserve Act](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/fract.htm) that allows the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) to remove her for cause. “Any such restriction on the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s authority to remove should be construed as narrowly as possible to avoid the constitutional doubts raised by interference with the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s presumptive power to remove executive officers under [Article II](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/article-2/), particularly principal officers. On top of that, the history of how courts, including this [Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/), have understood ‘for cause’ removal restrictions counsels strongly against the judiciary’s second-guessing the decision of the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) to remove [Cook](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/cook.htm),” they write in their brief.

Joining [Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/) [Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general) in the brief are the [attorneys general](https://republicanags.com/) of [Alabama](https://www.alabamaag.gov/), [Alaska](https://law.alaska.gov/), [Arkansas](https://arkansasag.gov/), [Florida](https://www.myfloridalegal.com/), [Georgia](https://law.georgia.gov/), [Idaho](https://www.ag.idaho.gov/), [Indiana](https://www.in.gov/attorneygeneral/), [Iowa](https://www.iowaattorneygeneral.gov/), [Kansas](https://www.ag.ks.gov/home), [Kentucky](https://ag.ky.gov/Pages/default.aspx), [Louisiana](https://ag.louisiana.gov/), [Mississippi](https://attorneygenerallynnfitch.com/), [Missouri](https://ago.mo.gov/), [Montana](https://ago.mo.gov/), [Nebraska](https://ago.nebraska.gov/), [North Dakota](https://attorneygeneral.nd.gov/), [Oklahoma](https://oklahoma.gov/oag.html), [South Dakota](https://atg.sd.gov/#gsc.tab=0), [Tennessee](https://www.tn.gov/attorneygeneral.html), [Texas](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/), and [West Virginia](https://ago.wv.gov/), and the [Arizona Legislature](https://www.azleg.gov/).
