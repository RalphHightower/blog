## [Trump struggles to explain why a bailout for Argentina meets his ‘America First’ standards](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-struggles-explain-bailout-argentina-meets-america-first-standard-rcna237806)

*The [American president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) admitted that his \$20 billion bailout for a South American ally probably won’t benefit the United States very much.*

Oct. 15, 2025, 12:17 PM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

As [Donald Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-corruption-egypt-qatar-argentina-strongman-rcna237585) greeted [Argentinian](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/) [President](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/argentina-bailout-trump-milei-bessent-maga-rcna234502) at the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), a reporter shouted out a question about the [American president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s message to the people of [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/).

“We love them,” [Trump replied](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3m36bn7p5oh2b). “We’ll be there for them.”

The latter point was clearly true. In fact, the United States will “be there” for [Argentinians](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/) to the tune of \$20 billion: That’s the figure of the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s recently announced bailout, intended to help bolster the South American country’s economy as it confronts a possible crisis.

As Tuesday afternoon progressed, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) celebrated his likeminded ally — [Milei](https://www.casarosada.gob.ar/el-presidente/) is “[MAGA](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) all the way,” the [American president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) said — though he struggled with a question he should’ve seen coming. [The Washington Post reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/):

> *President [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) on Tuesday touted a \$20 billion foreign bailout that he acknowledged would not primarily serve American interests, testing his leeway with his own ‘America First’ motto and in particular the patience of domestic farmers who have yet to receive their own relief from [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s trade war.*

In response to questions about the expensive U.S. bailout, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) conceded, “It’s not going to make a big difference for our country.” In other words, American taxpayers will be on the hook for \$20 billion, but they shouldn’t expect to see much in the way of returns on the investment.

He went on to say that the money is intended to “help a good financial philosophy,” adding that if [Argentinian](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/) voters turned against [Milei](https://www.casarosada.gob.ar/el-presidente/), the Republican [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) would abandon the bailout package and allow the South American country to move closer to a possible crisis.

For decades, U.S. bailouts of other countries have been wildly unpopular, and it’s not hard to understand why: For many Americans, especially those struggling, it’s difficult to understand why federal officials would send their tax dollars to bolster a different country’s economy.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), ostensibly a champion of an “America First” philosophy, not only appears indifferent to those concerns, he didn’t exactly bring persuasive talking points to sell his idea on the merits. On the contrary, the [American president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) made it sound as if he’s using a whole lot of taxpayer dollars to bolster a struggling foreign ally who’s facing an uncertain electoral future.

It’s worth emphasizing that, under the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s policy, [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/) will be expected to eventually repay the funds. That said, the [International Monetary Fund](https://www.imf.org/) has [has had to bail out Argentina 23 times](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-corruption-egypt-qatar-argentina-strongman-rcna237585), and the country owes the [IMF](https://www.imf.org/) more money than any other country on the planet.

Indeed, the most recent [IMF](https://www.imf.org/) bailout was just [in April](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2025/04/12/pr25101-argentina-imf-executive-board-approves-48-month-usd20-billion-extended-arrangement), and even that wasn’t enough to keep [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/)’s economy and its peso from continuing to tank.

Or put another way, Americans probably shouldn’t hold their breath waiting for a return on [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s lucrative loan.
