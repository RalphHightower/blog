*When the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) signed an executive order in March asserting radical powers over elections, he invited lawsuits. He’s now losing the court fights.*

Nov. 3, 2025, 9:20 AM EST
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

When [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) signed an executive order in March asserting radical powers over federal elections, it was widely assumed that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s power grab would spark lawsuits he was likely to lose. Those assumptions, unsurprisingly, were correct. [The New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/us/politics/trump-proof-citizenship-voter-registration.html):

> *A federal judge in [Washington](https://wldc.gov/) permanently barred the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) on Friday from requiring proof of citizenship on federal voter registration forms, a change dictated in an executive order [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) signed in March. The ruling definitively halted the effort to compel the [Elections Assistance Commission](http://www.eac.gov/), an independent body, to adopt nationwide changes to voting procedures.*

[Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/senior-judge-colleen-kollar-kotelly), who was first appointed to the bench by [Ronald Reagan](https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/), explained in her [81-page ruling](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.279032/gov.uscourts.dcd.279032.218.0_1.pdf) that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was claiming a power to which he is not entitled.

“[Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) has never assigned any responsibility for the content of the federal form to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) or to any other individual in the executive branch with the power to act unilaterally,” she wrote. “The power to alter the federal form is — and always has been — delegated solely to a bipartisan, independent commission.”

The [Times](https://www.nytimes.com/)’ report noted that the opinion “traced American history back to the country’s founding, repeatedly noting that besides the small role of the [Elections Assistance Commission](https://www.eac.gov/), which was created by [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) in 2002 to assist with elections, the Elections Clause of the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/) grants authority over elections to the states.”

[Kollar-Kotelly](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/senior-judge-colleen-kollar-kotelly) added, “The Court pauses to note a conspicuous absence from the legal and historical context thus far provided. The states have initial authority to regulate elections. [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) has supervisory authority over those regulations. The [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) does not feature at all.”

For those who might benefit from a recap, let’s review [how we arrived at this point](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/elections-executive-order-trump-claims-powers-not-rcna198163).

Last year, congressional [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s [tried to advance legislation](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-advance-act-solution-search-problem-rcna161316) called the [Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act (or SAVE Act)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/128), to require proof of citizenship to register to vote. The bill did not, however, pass the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) or become law.

This year, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) apparently decided that he [could just create the policy anyway](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/elections-executive-order-trump-claims-powers-not-rcna198163) through [presidential](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) fiat. It was an approach rooted in a fundamentally ridiculous governing vision: When [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) fails to pass a bill, [presidents](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) can simply implement the policy anyway, without legislative authorization.

“[Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) has never assigned any responsibility for the content of the federal form to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) or to any other individual in the executive branch with the power to act unilaterally,” she wrote. “The power to alter the federal form is — and always has been — delegated solely to a bipartisan, independent commission.”

[Kollar-Kotelly](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/senior-judge-colleen-kollar-kotelly) added, “The Court pauses to note a conspicuous absence from the legal and historical context thus far provided. The states have initial authority to regulate elections. [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) has supervisory authority over those regulations.

Last year, congressional [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) tried to advance legislation called the [Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act (or SAVE Act)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/128), to require proof of citizenship to register to vote. The bill did not, however, pass the Senate or become law.

This year, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) apparently decided that he could just create the policy anyway through [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)ial fiat. It was an approach rooted in a fundamentally ridiculous governing vision: When [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) fails to pass a bill, [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)s can simply implement the policy anyway, without legislative authorization.

What’s more, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s executive order on this didn’t stop with new requirements that would force Americans to prove their citizenship when registering to vote. It also imposed a variety of other election “reforms” — touching on everything from mail-in ballot deadlines to election equipment — that [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/trump-signs-executive-order-requiring-proof-citizenship-register-vote-rcna198094) “could risk disenfranchising tens of millions of Americans.”

The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) did all of this by exercising a legal authority he decided to bestow on himself. The judiciary has now reminded him, [more than once](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/judge-halts-trumps-power-grab-federal-elections-voter-registrations-rcna212824), that this is not an option.

If recent history is any guide, the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) will appeal the ruling, and House [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) will consider impeaching the judge in this case. Watch this space.
