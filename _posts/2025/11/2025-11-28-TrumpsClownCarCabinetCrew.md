## [Trump’s clown car Cabinet keeps humiliating him](https://www.ms.now/news/trumps-clown-car-cabinet-keeps-humiliating-him)

*The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) said he assembled the “most talented and impressive [Administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) in history.” But a series of recent embarrassments from Trump officials suggests otherwise.*

Nov. 28, 2025, 6:00 AM EST
By Jen Psaki

This is an adapted excerpt from the [Nov. 25](https://www.ms.now/jen-psaki) episode of [“The Briefing with Jen Psaki.”](https://www.ms.now/jen-psaki)

[Donald Trump](https://www.ms.now/white-house) has been humiliated a lot lately. And while most of the time that’s because of his own behavior, it’s also because of the people he surrounds himself with.

Just consider how two of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s top law enforcement officials have been spending their time lately. Last weekend, [Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/) [Secretary](https://www.dhs.gov/kristi-noem) [Kristi Noem](https://www.ms.now/morning-joe/kristi-noem-unlawful-deportation-flights-emil-bove-cautionary-tale) and [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Director](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) [Kash Patel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wRn1ppeUbs) were in [Las Vegas](https://www.lasvegasnevada.gov/), hanging out in a [pink Lego race car](https://www.thedailybeast.com/keystone-kash-and-ice-barbie-jet-off-to-races-amid-security-perk-scandal/) while attending a [Formula 1](https://www.formula1.com/en/) [race](https://www.formula1.com/en/racing/2025/las-vegas).

Now, if this were a one-off incident, you might forgive them for having a little fun after the rigors of their very important day jobs. But for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Cabinet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/), living like a C-list celebrity is the job.

I know from experience that when a [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) statement contains any version of “The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has confidence in,” or “This [Cabinet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/) member is a part of a great team,” it isn’t typically a good sign.

No one seems to do that job better than [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel). Over the past few months, the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director has repeatedly used a government jet for [recreational travel](https://www.thedailybeast.com/keystone-kash-facing-axe-over-misuse-of-government-jet/), including for a golf trip with friends at a private resort in [Scotland](https://www.mygov.scot/organisations/scottish-government) and attending a wrestling event in [Pennsylvania](https://www.pa.gov/), as well as a getaway to a [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) [hunting resort](https://boondoggleranch.com/) called the [“Boondoggle Ranch.”](https://www.thedailybeast.com/keystone-kash-patel-caught-out-for-private-jet-jaunt-to-maga-ranch/)

On top of all that, [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) [reportedly has also](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/23/us/politics/kash-patel-girlfriend-fbi-protection.html) redirected [SWAT](https://www.fbi.gov/news/gallery/swat) team agents from critical duties, presumably such as responding to actual emergencies, to serve as the personal security detail for his [27-year-old girlfriend](https://www.alexiswilkins.com/).

That’s reportedly causing his headline-obsessed boss, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), to have second thoughts about choosing him to lead the country’s top law enforcement agency. On Tuesday, [MS NOW reported](https://www.ms.now/news/trump-kash-patel-replacing-fbi-director-planes-girlfriend): “[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is considering removing [Kash Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) as [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director in the coming months, as he and his top aides have grown increasingly frustrated by the unflattering headlines [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) has recently generated, according to three people with knowledge of the situation.”

If that were to happen, [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) would have had the shortest tenure of any confirmed [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director in history, making it through only about a year of what is supposed to be a 10-year term.

Now, the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) quickly tried to push back on that reporting. A spokesperson told [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/) that “[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has assembled the most talented and impressive [Administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) in history and they are doing an excellent job carrying out the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s agenda,” adding that [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) “is a critical member of the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s team and he is working tirelessly to restore integrity to the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/).”

> **I know from experience that when a [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) statement contains any version of “The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has confidence in,” or “This [Cabinet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/) member is a part of a great team,” it isn’t typically a good sign.**

But the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) really left us an opening there with that statement, and it got us wondering: What are the other members of the “most talented and impressive [Administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) in history” up to these days?

Well, let’s start with the other member of [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s pit crew, [Noem](https://www.dhs.gov/kristi-noem). When she isn’t spending her days [playing cowgirl dress-up]({% link _posts/2025/02/2025-02-11-KristiNoemCosplay.md %}) or riding around in [Lego](https://www.lego.com/en-us) cars, the former [South Dakota](https://www.sd.gov/) governor has been facing considerable scrutiny over a [report from ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/kristi-noem-dhs-ad-campaign-strategy-group) that her agency funneled hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars to a firm with ties to [Noem](https://www.dhs.gov/kristi-noem) herself. A group of lawmakers has now called for an investigation into how that firm ended up getting all that taxpayer money.

Then there’s the former reality TV star [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) put in charge of our nation’s travel infrastructure, [Transportation](https://www.transportation.gov/) [Secretary](https://www.transportation.gov/meet-secretary/us-transportation-secretary-sean-duffy) [Sean Duffy](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/faa-sean-duffy-air-travel-rcna206529). Right now, [Duffy](https://www.transportation.gov/meet-secretary/us-transportation-secretary-sean-duffy) has a lot on his plate: Americans are preparing for the busiest travel season of the year, and the recent government shutdown has led to a wave of flight cancellations that continue even after the government reopened.

But Americans shouldn’t worry — [Duffy](https://www.transportation.gov/meet-secretary/us-transportation-secretary-sean-duffy) has an idea that is going to fix this country’s air travel once and for all. This week, the transportation secretary encouraged Thanksgiving travelers to [“dress a little better,”](https://thehill.com/regulation/transportation/5622004-duffy-thanksgiving-travel/) which he argued could help people “behave a little better.”

Remember, this is the same man who just [scrapped a Biden-era proposal](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/travel/trump-biden-delayed-flights-payments.html) to compensate travelers for flight disruptions.

But I’ve got to say, compared with some of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s other [Cabinet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/) secretaries, [Duffy](https://www.transportation.gov/meet-secretary/us-transportation-secretary-sean-duffy) almost seems like a problem-solver.

Just consider [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/) [secretary](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent), [Scott Bessent](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/treasurys-bessent-concedes-parts-economy-are-already-recession-rcna241671). Right now, he also has a lot on his plate: [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s tariff policy is a disaster, all those deals the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) promised haven’t come to fruition, prices are up, housing costs are up and health care costs are about to go way up for a lot of people.

But don’t worry, because Bessent also has a plan. This week, [told Americans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSI7TpNg3Kw) that the “best way” to bring down inflation was to “move from a blue state to a red state.”

Then there’s [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [secretary](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) of [health and human services](https://www.hhs.gov/), [Robert F. Kennedy Jr.](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/former-cdc-directors-rfk-jr-anything-country-ever-experienced-rcna228574). The man in charge of our nation’s health has been hard at work recently, making the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/) [update its website with new warnings](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/cdc-vaccine-safety-webpage-changed-to-contradict-scientific-conclusion-that-vaccines-dont-cause-autism). The agency’s “vaccine safety” webpage now says that “the statement ‘Vaccines do not cause autism’ is not an evidence-based claim.”

[Defense](https://www.defense.gov/) [Secretary](https://www.war.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) [Pete Hegseth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78UgeIKSklA), the man in charge of the world’s largest military, is currently spending his working days ordering an investigation into [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Mark Kelly (D-AZ)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6A3kC2h2Bu8) over the [Arizona Democrat](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/)’s participation in a social media video reminding members of the armed forces that they [do not have to follow illegal orders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1FdAKL3kjU) .

[Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/) responded to the news of this investigation by [posting on X](https://x.com/SenMarkKelly/status/1993025671757807746/photo/1) a photo of the numerous medals he was awarded for his service in the [Navy](https://www.navy.mil%). Which, in turn, prompted the defense secretary to [launch a new attack](https://x.com/PeteHegseth/status/1993295993321009570) over, of all things, whether [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/) displayed his medals in the right order.

Even some [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) are admitting this whole thing is ridiculous. On Tuesday, [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Lisa Murkowski (T-AK)](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/) [posted on X](https://x.com/lisamurkowski/status/1993458701601014111): “The [Department of Defense](https://www.defense.gov/) and [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) surely have more important priorities than this frivolous investigation.”

Now, it’s clear none of the people [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) chose to be part of his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) are exactly killing it these days. But there is perhaps nowhere in [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) suffering more embarrassment than the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/).

In just the past week, we learned that [Lindsey Halligan](https://www.ms.now/opinion/msnbc-opinion/lindsey-halligan-james-comey-prosecution-grand-jury-rcna244873), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s handpicked prosecutor leading the investigations into two of his rivals, made critical mistakes that jeopardized their entire case against former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Director](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) [James Comey](https://www.ms.now/the-beat-with-ari/watch/2025-election-loser-trump-rocked-by-comey-loss-james-loss-halligan-loss-epstein-loss-2470348867935).

Then, on Monday, a judge ruled that the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) never properly appointed Halligan in the first place, meaning the cases she brought against [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) and [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) [Attorney General](https://ag.ny.gov/) [Letitia James](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-house-slams-judge-as-trumps-cases-against-james-comey-and-tish-james-collapse) have now been dismissed.

At the same time, we learned that the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) is [investigating two Trump officials](https://abcnews.go.com/US/doj-fbi-probing-top-trump-administration-officials-investigations/story?id=127602305) for potentially violating the law during [their investigation into another of Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s political rivals, [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Adam Schiff (D-CA)](https://www.ms.now/news/grand-jury-trump-critics-ed-martin-bill-pulte-rcna244980) of California.

There is perhaps nothing more important to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) in his second term than his [revenge tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z90k25vTiYk) against his rivals. But somehow, those prosecutions have become the biggest example of incompetence from an [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) staffed by some of the most inept lackeys this country has ever seen.
