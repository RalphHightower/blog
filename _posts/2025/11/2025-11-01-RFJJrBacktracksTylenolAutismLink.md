*Despite [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s rants, the [health secretary](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) conceded there’s “not sufficient” evidence to prove a connection between [Tylenol](https://www.tylenol.com/) and autism.*

Oct. 31, 2025, 1:29 PM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

As the summer neared its end, [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) did his best to hype a scheduled [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) event on autism. The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [assured the public](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3lz7sbm63wg2q) that he was poised to deliver an announcement that was “very, very big.” A day later, he [added](https://x.com/Acyn/status/1969570225948672154) that the information he was ready to share was “so big.”

As is too often the case, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s results couldn’t match his rhetoric. When the event happened, Americans saw a [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) spend an hour peddling [outlandish claims about Tylenol](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/-much-liquid-trump-pretends-s-qualified-give-medical-advice-s-not-rcna233159). Making matters worse, the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) conceded his conclusions were rooted in his “[feelings](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5516749-trump-vaccine-suggestions-autism-links/)” — as opposed to those who base their findings on, you know, “[studies](https://bsky.app/profile/thebulwark.com/post/3lzhid6h3i32v).”

[Paul Offit](https://www.chop.edu/doctors/offit-paul-a), a pediatrician and vaccine researcher at [Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia](https://www.chop.edu/), [told The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/09/23/trump-vaccines-autism-mmr-schedule/), “That was the most dangerously irresponsible press conference in the realm of public health in American history.”

A month later, [Reuters reported](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-health-chief-says-not-enough-data-show-tylenol-causes-autism-still-advises-2025-10-29/) on more recent comments from [Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html):

> *[Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s top health official on Wednesday said evidence does not show that [Kenvue](https://www.kenvue.com/)’s pain medicine [Tylenol](https://www.tylenol.com/) definitively causes autism but that it should still be used cautiously, a month after the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) said U.S. health officials would recommend limiting its use. ‘The causative association ... between [Tylenol](https://www.tylenol.com/) given in pregnancy and the perinatal periods is not sufficient to say it definitely cause autism. But it is very suggestive,’ [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) told reporters, citing animal, blood and observational studies.*

It’s hard not to wonder whether [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) took note of the comments.

Indeed, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has been quite animated about acetaminophen lately. In the aftermath of his ridiculous [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) event in mid-September, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [continued to push](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trump-unproven-medical-advice-tylenol-vaccines-rcna233911) hysterical rhetoric about [Tylenol](https://www.tylenol.com/), [online](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115271135823530018) and [on camera](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3m2rmxnepyc2b), claiming that he’s “[studied this a long time](https://bsky.app/profile/factpostnews.bsky.social/post/3m2ro4nr2ox2v).” (He has no background in science or medicine and has a track record of [promoting unscientific nonsense](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/despite-reality-trump-says-disinfectant-comments-were-sarcastic-n1192051).)

In the following weeks, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) kept going, even interrupting his Asia trip this week to publish [an anti-Tylenol screed](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115442316583935494) to his social media platform. “Pregnant Women, DON’T USE [TYLENOL](https://www.tylenol.com/) UNLESS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY, DON’T GIVE [TYLENOL](https://www.tylenol.com/) TO YOUR YOUNG CHILD FOR VIRTUALLY ANY REASON,” he wrote for reasons unknown.

Around the same time, [Ken Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office), [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/)’ scandal-plagued [attorney general](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/), followed the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s cues and [sued the current and former makers of Tylenol](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/texas-sues-tylenol-makers-disproven-claims-autism-rcna240259), echoing debunked [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) claims related to autism.

One day after the [Texas](https://www.texas.gov%) [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)’s case was filed, [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) (who was cited repeatedly [in Paxton’s court filing](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/images/press/Lawsuit.pdf)) conceded that there’s “not sufficient” evidence to prove a connection between [Tylenol](https://www.tylenol.com/) and vaccines.

Whether he realizes this or not, the [Cabinet](https://www.hhs.gov=) [secretary](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) has created overlapping messes. On the one hand, [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) made a public concession that cut off his allies at the knees. On the other, the longtime conspiracy theorist nevertheless claimed there’s a “suggestive” link between the painkiller and autism, [which isn’t supported by the science](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2025/10/30/rfk-jr-tylenol-autism-texas-lawsuit/86989978007/?tbref=hp).

The result is a dynamic in which the American mainstream will continue to struggle when it comes to trusting federal public health officials.
