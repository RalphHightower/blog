## [Pentagon reportedly prepping thousands of National Guard for nationwide crackdown](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/pentagon-national-guard-quick-reaction-force-rcna240966)

*Multiple outlets reported on internal documents outlining plans to prepare more than 20,000 troops from all 50 states to respond to “civil unrest.”*

Oct. 31, 2025, 11:59 AM EDT
By [Ja'han Jones](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jahan-jones-ncpn371241)

Following massive anti-[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) demonstrations at [this month’s No Kings protests](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/no-kings-protests-trump-successful-anti-authoritarian-movements-rcna238949) and [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s recent threats to send “[more than the National Guard](https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/trump-warns-he-will-send-more-than-national-guard-to-some-u-s-cities-if-we-need/3844549/)” and to use “[“dangerous cities as training grounds for our military National Guard,”](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-directs-generals-defend-us-war/story?id=126087035)” newly unearthed [Pentagon](https://www.defense.gov/) documents show the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) is training more than 20,000 [National Guard](https://www.nationalguard.mil/) troops as a “quick reaction force” with “civil unrest training,” ready to deploy by April 1.

The documents — which have been reviewed by [The Washington Post,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/10/30/pentagon-national-guard-quick-reaction-force/) The [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/pentagon-orders-national-guard-to-establish-quick-reaction-forces-for-civil-unrest-riots-f602b193?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqehX9dIVJ-naD6dbheLpc9dK50poZzLKP43fH2oveM7GSnkaYUNBDlIYifqXuM%3D&gaa_ts=6904c311&gaa_sig=1Js2yaH5PfkV_FjmiVenR4B9oYIbcMXpntUtO5UJfC4W6ZWdaNihuePKn66y_87gxgQfUAcFDpOhmCkPDBZvxQ%3D%3D) and [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/29/pentagon-memo-quick-reaction-forces), but have not been independently reviewed by [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) — detail plans for a significant expansion of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s plan to send [National Guard](https://www.nationalguard.mil/) troops into American streets.

According to the [Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/):

> *The [Defense Department](https://www.jcs.mil/)’s newly established ‘quick reaction force’ within the [National Guard](https://www.nationalguard.mil/) must be trained, equipped with riot-control gear and ready for deployment by Jan. 1, according to internal documents reviewed by [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/). The 200 troops will be drawn from [National Guard](https://www.nationalguard.mil/) personnel whose primary focus is responding to disasters like nuclear accidents and terrorist attacks, the documents said.*

The [Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) goes on to detail plans to expand that number by April:

> *An existing separate but similar structure, the [National Guard](https://www.nationalguard.mil/) Reaction Force, is expected to complete civil unrest training and be fully operational by April 1. The total size of the force will be 23,500 troops across all 50 states and three territories, excluding the [District of Columbia](https://dc.gov/), the documents say. Most states will supply 500 personnel for the reaction force, with the rest falling between 250 and 450. Those forces are typically used for emergencies like disaster relief, not on call troops for civil unrest.*

Aside from the fact there is no evidence of any actual “insurrection” in a single American city, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) officials in recent weeks have baselessly [referred](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/stephen-millers-weird-vision-vast-left-wing-conspiracy-matters-rcna236217) to liberals and protesters as [“terrorists.”](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/10/17/trump-spokeswoman-hamas-crime-illegal-immigration/86744479007/) During his speech to military leaders in September, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said these groups were being created to target the “enemy within,” referring to other Americans with a phrase with fascist echoes.

The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) continues to weaponize federal agencies and the [U.S. military](https://www.jcs.mil/) to target his opposition. He’s [tapped far-right election deniers](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/us/politics/election-deniers-trump-administration.html) for top positions in his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/), and for next week’s elections, his [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) has said it will [deploy election monitors](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-election-monitors-california-new-jersey-legal-rcna240313) to polling sites in [New Jersey](https://www.nj.gov/) and [California](https://www.ca.gov/), where the state is set to vote on whether to authorize a new, [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/)-friendly congressional redistricting. Now the [Pentagon](https://www.defense.gov/) (led by [scandal-plagued](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/pete-hegseth-signal-scandal-texts-portland-rcna235885) former [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) host [Pete Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/)) seems intent on repurposing the [National Guard](https://www.nationalguard.mil/) for what is shaping up to be a nationwide show of force against the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s critics.

Numerous [polls](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/polls-show-unpopularity-trumps-militarization-campaign-dictator-claims-rcna227745) throughout the year have shown [broad majorities](https://www.axios.com/2025/10/08/trump-military-deployment-criticism-polls-october) of Americans oppose the deployment of [National Guard](https://www.nationalguard.mil/) into American cities.

Evidence suggests that even some members of the [National Guard](https://www.nationalguard.mil/) aren’t on board with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s plans. The [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/16/us/trump-national-guard-california.html) earlier this year on troops deployed to [California](https://www.ca.gov/) who “spoke of low morale and deep concern that the deployment may hurt recruitment.” Two [Illinois National Guard](https://www.il.ngb.army.mil/) members recently [told CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/illinois-national-guard-members-speak-out-i-wont-turn-against-my-neighbors/) they would refuse to obey orders to turn on fellow residents as part of the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) crackdown in [Chicago](https://www.chicago.gov/), accusing the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) of using public safety claims as a pretext to weaponize the military against civilians.
