## [Judge says DOJ failed to give full transcripts of Halligan’s Comey grand jury proceedings](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/james-comey-grand-jury-transcript-lindsey-halligan-rcna241879)

*A federal judge considering the legality of [Lindsey Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/)’s appointment gave the government until Wednesday at 5 p.m. to comply with her order.*

Nov. 4, 2025, 3:42 PM EST
By [Jordan Rubin](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jordan-rubin-ncpn1301611)

The federal judge considering whether [Lindsey Halligan](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/comey-james-lindsey-halligan-grand-jury-ask-jordan-rcna241100) was unlawfully installed by the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) had ordered the [Department of Justice](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to provide the “complete grand jury transcripts” in [James Comey’s case](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/james-comey-case-selective-vindictive-prosecution-rcna241620) for the judge to review. The [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) failed to do so, and now it has a deadline of 5 p.m. Wednesday to comply.

On Oct. 28, [U.S. District](https://www.scd.uscourts.gov/) [Judge Cameron McGowan Currie](https://www.scd.uscourts.gov/Judges/distjudge.asp) issued [an order](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.582136/gov.uscourts.vaed.582136.95.0.pdf) that said she needs to “determine the extent of the indictment signer’s involvement in the grand jury proceedings.” [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/), a former personal lawyer for [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) who lacks prior prosecutorial experience, presented the [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) case [to the grand jury herself](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/trump-james-comey-indictment-us-attorney-lindsey-halligan-rcna233853), over the objection of career prosecutors.

[Currie](https://www.scd.uscourts.gov/Judges/distjudge.asp) had ordered that by Monday, Nov. 3, the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) was to provide her with “all documents relating to the indictment signer’s participation in the grand jury proceedings, along with complete grand jury transcripts.”

But on Tuesday, [Currie](https://www.scd.uscourts.gov/Judges/distjudge.asp) issued a [new order](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.582135/gov.uscourts.vaed.582135.148.0.pdf) that said the material she received “fails to include remarks made by the indictment signer both before and after the testimony of the sole witness, which remarks were referenced by the indictment signer during the witness’s testimony.” The judge gave the government until Wednesday to comply.

[Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) [was indicted](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/james-comey-pleads-not-guilty-trump-halligan-rcna236313) in the [Eastern District of Virginia](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/), where [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) purports to lead the [U.S. Attorney’s Office](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) after the previous head was [forced out](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-forces-uncooperative-us-attorney-virginia-touching-new-scandal-rcna232515) for refusing to prosecute [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s political opponents. [Currie](https://www.scd.uscourts.gov/Judges/distjudge.asp), a [Bill Clinton]() appointee, is a [South Carolina federal judge](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/), but she is handling this issue because it requires an out-of-district judge to oversee. (Federal district judges are potentially involved in the appointment of a replacement U.S. attorney for their district when there is a vacancy.)

[Currie](https://www.scd.uscourts.gov/Judges/distjudge.asp) is simultaneously overseeing the challenge against [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/)’s appointment brought by [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) [Attorney General](https://ag.ny.gov/) [Letitia James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james), another of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s political opponents. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) demanded her prosecution, and it was [secured by Halligan in Virginia](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/letitia-james-not-guilty-plea-fraud-indictment-halligan-comey-trump-rcna239548) in [Virginia](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/). Both [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) and [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james) have pleaded not guilty and are pressing [several motions to dismiss](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/james-comey-indictment-trump-pretrial-motions-rcna236650) their indictments on top of their argument that [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) was [unlawfully appointed](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/comey-cites-samuel-alito-clarence-thomas-arguing-halligans-appointment-rcna238864).

Lawyers temporarily installed by the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) to lead U.S. attorney’s offices across the country have had their tenures [deemed unlawful by federal judges.](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/comey-james-lindsey-halligan-appointment-rcna240482). [Currie](https://www.scd.uscourts.gov/Judges/distjudge.asp) may well deem [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/)’s appointment unlawful, too, but she has yet to rule. The judge had [also ordered](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.583341/gov.uscourts.vaed.583341.28.0.pdf) the government to provide her with grand jury information for [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james)’ proceedings, but as of the time she issued the order for more information in [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey)’s case, she hadn’t issued a similar order in [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james)’ case.
