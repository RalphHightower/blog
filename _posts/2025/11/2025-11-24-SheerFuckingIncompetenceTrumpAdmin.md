## [Amateur hour: The White House keeps tripping over its own incompetence](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/amateur-hour-the-white-house-keeps-tripping-over-its-own-incompetence)

*On multiple fronts, [Donald [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and [his team](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) are failing for the most embarrassing of reasons: They don’t appear to have any idea what they’re doing.*


Nov. 24, 2025, 11:22 AM EST
By [Steve Benen](https://www.ms.now/author/steve-benen)

One of the keys to the [Republican Party](https://www.gop.com/)’s strategy to hold on to its congressional majority is a radical mid-decade redistricting gambit, intended to hand the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) a series of victories long before voters cast any ballots. At the heart of this gerrymandering initiative was a [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) scheme that redrew the state’s district map to deliver five additional seats to the [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/).

Last week, the [Lone Star State](https://www.texas.gov/)’s new map, approved at the insistence of [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his team, was [rejected by a federal three-judge panel](https://www.vox.com/politics/469426/texas-gerrymander-struck-down-race-supreme-court) led by a [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) appointee. That ruling is currently on hold, but if the map is ultimately struck down, the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/)’s odds of holding on to its House majority will fall.

[Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) will have no one to blame but themselves. [Vox’s Ian Millhiser explained](https://www.vox.com/politics/469426/texas-gerrymander-struck-down-race-supreme-court):

> **As [Judge Jeffrey Brown](), a [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) appointee, explains in the court’s opinion, [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) lawmakers initially ‘didn’t have much appetite to redistrict on purely partisan grounds’ — even as [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) urged them to do so. But [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s appear to have changed their mind after the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) sent a letter last July to [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/)’s top officials, which demanded that the state redraw several districts to change their racial makeup. That letter … misread a federal appeals court opinion to mean that the state was required to remake its maps.**

It led [Millhiser]() to conclude that there is “a very real chance that [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/)’s gerrymander will fall entirely because of inept lawyering by [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/).”

Such a development would carry dramatic consequences, but just as notable is the familiarity of the circumstances.

The [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/)’s case against former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) Director [James Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) also appears to be in serious jeopardy of collapsing, in large part because the prosecution was put in the hands of a rookie [who’s made rookie mistakes](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/lindsey-halligans-mistakes-could-sink-the-comey-prosecution.html).

This is just the start of a longer list. The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has seen [a variety](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-latest-failed-nominee-makes-white-house-appear-even-incompetent-rcna239083) of [presidential nominees](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/ej-antonis-failed-nomination-makes-white-house-look-even-incompetent-rcna234896) fail in recent weeks because of the officials’ incompetence. [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Director Kash Patel]() has struggled through a series of embarrassing missteps [resulting from his own incompetence](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/kash-patel-fbi-problems-rcna230812). The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s trade tariffs have been executed in [brazenly incompetent ways](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/restarting-trade-war-trumps-tariffs-add-new-chaos-uncertainty-economy-rcna217479). The Kilmar Abrego Garica case has been [hampered by prosecutorial incompetence](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/kilmar-abrego-garcia-indicted-charges-trump-el-salvador-rcna203850). [Elon Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk)’s [failed DOGE experiment](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/the-white-houses-failed-doge-experiment-ends-with-a-whimper-not-a-bang) was so incompetent that it [repeatedly stepped on its own tail](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/elon-musk-doge-keep-scrambling-correct-many-mistakes-rcna194717).

Over the course of 2025, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his inner circle made a series of decisions to strip the ,[administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) of competent professionals and qualified experts. The results weren’t just predictable, they were also inevitable.
