I wouldn't mind seeing an oil derrick on [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) and on [Trump International Golf Club West Palm Beach](https://www.trumpinternationalpalmbeaches.com/). Also, put up a wind farm in plain view of [Donnie](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).

*Some of the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s most loyal supporters in his home state are not happy about his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s newly announced plans for offshore drilling. But what else did they expect?*

[Florida [Republicans](https://www.ms.now/top-stories/latest/florida-doge-knockoff-bears-blemishes-original-rcna237673) fiercely backed [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s presidential campaign as he was essentially promising to [give the oil industry anything it wanted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/05/09/trump-oil-industry-campaign-money/), yet now they seem taken aback that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is [following through on his vow](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/30/climate/trump-campaign-funding-oil-industry-tax-breaks.html).

[Florida Democrats](https://floridadems.org/) in the state are [broadly opposed](https://floridadems.org/2025/11/florida-democratic-party-responds-to-trump-administration-proposal-to-open-floridas-coasts-to-offshore-drilling/) to the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s plans to drill in an area off the state’s coast. And [Florida Republicans](https://florida.gop/) – perhaps backed by a growing belief that they can oppose the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) without jeopardizing their careers – are speaking out as well.

Gov. [Ron DeSantis](https://www.ms.now/top-stories/latest/desantis-turning-point-usa-florida-partnership-rcna240614) and [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/)’s two senators, [Rick Scott (T-FL)](https://www.rickscott.senate.gov/) and [Ashley Moody (T-FL)](https://www.moody.senate.gov/), are among the loyal [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) allies who have joined a bipartisan coalition of [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/) officials in decrying the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s plan to [reverse decades of precedent](https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/20/climate/trump-oil-drilling-offshore-california-florida) by allowing offshore drilling in coveted regions off the coasts of [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/) [and California](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbmBZR5aoRY). 

During a news conference late last week, [DeSantis](https://www.flgov.com/eog/leadership/people/ron-desantis) publicly opposed the move, saying it would “weaken protections” for environmental preservation and military usage.

Early last month, [Scott](https://www.rickscott.senate.gov/) and [Moody](https://www.moody.senate.gov/) [backed a bill](https://floridapolitics.com/archives/763725-rick-scott-ashley-moody-seek-federal-ban-on-drilling-off-gulf-atlantic-coasts/) that would ban drilling off the Gulf Coast and the Atlantic Coast. Both senators have since expressed dismay over the [Interior Department](https://www.doi.gov/)’s announcement.

| Rick Scott |
| @SenRickScott<br />[Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/)’s beautiful beaches and coastal waters are so important to our state’s economy, environment, and military community, which is why I have fought for years to keep drilling off [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/)’s coasts and worked closely with [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) during his first term to extend the <br />3:54 PM · Nov 20, 2025 |
| Senator Ashley Moody |
| @SenAshleyMoody<br />The new maps released today by @SecretaryBurgum and @Interior outlining potential new offshore oil drilling sites in the Gulf of America are HIGHLY concerning—and we will be engaging directly with the department on this issue. <br /><br />Preserving our state’s natural beauty is deeply <br />3:42 PM · Nov 20, 2025 |

In addition, eight [House](https://www) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) from [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/) sent the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [a letter](https://patronis.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/patronis.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/preserving-the-eastern-gulf-test-and-training-range-from-drilling-rep-patronis.pdf), saying they are a champion of his “America First” agenda but are opposed to the drilling plans. The list includes Rep. [Byron Donalds (T-FL19)](https://donalds.house.gov/), a [Trump](https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/5205876-byron-donalds-flo-governor-race/), and [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Jimmy Patronis (T-FL1)](https://patronis.house.gov/), whom the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [endorsed in the race](https://floridapolitics.com/archives/717691-donald-trump-doubles-down-on-jimmy-patronis-endorsement/) for former Rep. Matt Gaetz’s seat. 

The fact that [MAGA](https://www.donaldjtrump.com%) loyalists are chirping about [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s oil agenda is both a sign of the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s disturbing deference to his benefactors in the industry — and, arguably, a victory for the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s climate-conscious critics [who warned](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/11/06/trump-win-climate-change-oil-gas/) about the potentially devastating effect of his cozy relationship with Big Oil.
