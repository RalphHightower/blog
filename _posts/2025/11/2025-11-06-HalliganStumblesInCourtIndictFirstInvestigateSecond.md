*In the latest mark against the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-demanded political prosecution, a judge observed an apparent rush to indict before fully investigating the case.*

Nov. 5, 2025, 4:58 PM EST
By [Jordan Rubin](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jordan-rubin-ncpn1301611)

The [Lindsey Halligan](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/james-comey-lindsey-halligan-grand-jury-ask-jordan-rcna236411)-led prosecution of [James Comey](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/james-comey-case-selective-vindictive-prosecution-rcna241620?icid=latestpost_bot) faced its latest rebuke Wednesday, when a federal judge said the government had taken an “indict first, investigate second” approach. It wasn’t the first time a judge has cast doubt on the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/)’s conduct in the case, still in its infancy, and it’s unlikely to be the last.

The critique came from [U.S. Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick](https://www.vaed.uslpcourts.gov/Alexandria) during a hearing in [Virginia](https://www.vaed.uslpcourts.gov/Alexandria) over the handling of evidence in the case brought by [Halligan](https;//www.justice.gov/usao-edva/), whom the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) installed [to secure the indictment](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/james-comey-pleads-not-guilty-trump-halligan-rcna236313) against the former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director over the objection of career prosecutors. The [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) [reported that](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/05/us/politics/judge-trump-prosecutor-comey.html) the judge “seemed exasperated with the government’s approach, described the case as ‘unusual’” and said, “We are in a little bit of a posture of indict first, investigate second.” The judge ordered the prosecution to turn over grand jury materials by Thursday.

That’s not to be confused with a different judge’s order this week for the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) to turn over grand jury transcripts by close of business Wednesday. That came from [U.S. District](https://www.scd.uscourts.gov/) [Judge Cameron McGowan Currie](https://www.scd.uscourts.gov/Judges/distjudge.asp), who is presiding over the litigation regarding [whether Halligan was lawfully appointed](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/comey-cites-samuel-alito-clarence-thomas-arguing-halligans-appointment-rcna238864) to lead the [U.S. Attorney](https://www.justice.gov/)’s [Office in the Eastern District of Virginia](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/). The [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) purported to temporarily install [Halligan](https;//www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) — one of [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s former personal lawyers, who lacked prior prosecutorial experience — after the office’s previous leader resisted charging [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) and [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) [Attorney General](https://ag.ny.gov/) [Letitia James](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/letitia-james-not-guilty-plea-fraud-indictment-halligan-comey-trump-rcna239548).

[Currie](https://www.scd.uscourts.gov/Judges/distjudge.asp) is a [South Carolina judge](https://www.scd.uscourts.gov/Judges/distjudge.asp) who was assigned to preside over the appointment issue because it requires a judge from outside of the [Virginia district](https://www.vaed.uslpcourts.gov/Alexandria) to handle. She previously ordered the government to produce the [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) grand jury materials for her review by Monday, but she [said in an order Tuesday](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/james-comey-grand-jury-transcript-lindsey-halligan-rcna241879) that what prosecutors gave her was incomplete.

Last month, the main jurist presiding over the [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) case in [Virginia, U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff](https://www.vaed.uslpcourts.gov/Alexandria), [rejected the DOJ’s motion](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/comey-indictment-trump-doj-discovery-ruling-rcna237506) for a protective order that, he wrote, “would unnecessarily hinder and delay Defendant’s ability to adequately prepare for trial.”

It’s unclear if a trial will be necessary to resolve the case, which was prompted by [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s explicit demand. [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey)’s challenge to the legality of [Halligan](https;//www.justice.gov/usao-edva/)’s appointment could lead to the case’s dismissal pretrial, as could his motion to dismiss based on [vindictive prosecution and other issues](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/james-comey-grand-jury-motion-lindsey-halligan-trump-rcna240838). While rulings on those big issues are still pending — and we should learn more later this month on how they might fare — these initial stumbles don’t bode well for the prosecution.
