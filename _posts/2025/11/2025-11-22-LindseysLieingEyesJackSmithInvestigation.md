## January 6, 2021. Senator Lindsey Graham (T-SC). Congressional Record – After Order Was Restored

Trump and I have had a hell of a journey. I hate it being this way. Oh, my God, I hate it. From my point of view, he has been a consequential President. But today, the first thing you will see, all I can say is, count me out. Enough is enough. I tried to be helpful. But when the Wisconsin supreme court ruled 4 to 3 that they didn’t violate the Constitution of Wisconsin, I agreed with the three, but I accept the four. If Al Gore can accept 5 to 4 he is not President, I can accept Wisconsin 4 to 3. Pennsylvania went to the Second Circuit. So much for all the judges being in Trump’s pocket. They said: No, you are wrong. I accept the Pennsylvania Second Circuit that Trump’s lawsuit wasn’t right. Georgia, they said the secretary of state took the law in his own hands, and he changed the election laws unlawfully. A Federal judge said no. I accept the Federal judge, even though I don’t agree with it. Fraud. They say there is 66,000 people in Georgia under 18 voting. How many people believe that? I asked: Give me 10. I haven’t had one. They said 8,000 felons in prison in Arizona voted. Give me 10. I haven’t gotten one. Does that say there are problems in every election? I don’t buy this. Enough is enough. We got to end it. -- 

## January 6 Amnesia

[Senator Lindsey Graham (T-SC)](https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/) has completely forgotten about what happened when [Trump](supporters stormed the Capitol to halt the transfer of power to the next administration. 

[Lindsey Graham (T-SC)](https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/) claims that he intends to sue the hell out of government for *"wiretapping"* his cellphones. The subpoenas were issued in 2022 by [Special Counsel Jack Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) in the 2020 election interference and January 6, 2022 insurrection to stop the certification of the Electoral College votes.

[Senator Lindsey Graham (T-SC)](https,://www.lgraham.senate.gov/) contacted [Georgia Secretary of State](https://sos.ga.gov/) asking him to throw out [Georgia](https://www.georgia.gov/) mail-in votes.[^171]

With apologies to Don Henly and Glenn Frye of The Eagles:

You can’t hide your Senate cries,<br />And your smile is just disguise.<br />Thought you’d cash in on the law,<br />But the House saw through it all.

Acting tough with Emmy flair,<br />Phones were seized, you shout unfair.<br />Bravo echoes through the hall,<br />But it’s taxpayers who foot it all.

### Ex Post Facto 

[Sec. 213. (a) In general.—Section 10 of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2005 (2 U.S.C. 6628) is amended—](https://ralphhightower.github.io/blog/2025/11/LindseysLieingEyesJackSmithInvestigation.html#sec-213-a-in-generalsection-10-of-the-legislative-branch-appropriations-act-2005-2-usc-6628-is-amended) of [H. R. 5371](https://www.congress.gov/119/bills/hr5371/BILLS-119hr5371enr.xml) is in direct violation of the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution_) [Article I. Section 9. Clause 3](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/article-1/#article-1-section-9-clause-3)
No Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed.

#### "Back To The Future" Paradox

Here is a simple explanation of ex post facto and why retroactive laws violate the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/) and why it is impossible to legislate the past.

In 2022, you drove 55 MPH on a highway where the posted speed limit is 55 MPH. In 2025, the speed limit is changed to 45 MPH with the speed limit change retroactive to 2022. The government cannot write you a speeding ticket in 2025 when it was legal in 2022.

Streamed live on Jan 6, 2021
Protesters pressed past police and broke into the U.S. Capitol as Congress met in a joint session on Jan. 6 to count each state’s electoral votes and confirm President-elect Joe Biden as the winner. As many as three dozen congressional Republicans were expected to launch a final challenge to the results of the 2020 presidential election.

It has become routine after recent elections for House lawmakers on the losing side to put up a symbolic fight over the results, which they can do under an 1880s law governing the process. It has been less common for senators to join them, but this time a dozen will. Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) will lead the challenge of the votes and call for an “emergency audit” to investigate baseless fraud allegations.

The Post’s Libby Casey will anchor live coverage, featuring reporters Aaron Blake, Rhonda Colvin, James Hohmann and Amber Phillips. Read more: https://wapo.st/3ohQZCg. Read more: https://wapo.st/3ohQZCg. Subscribe to The Washington Post on YouTube: https://wapo.st/2QOdcqK

The Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol was perhaps the most widely documented act of political violence in history. The New York Times obtained, analyzed and mapped out thousands of cellphone videos, police bodycam recordings and internal police audio to provide the most complete picture to date of what happened — and why. Our Oscar-shortlisted documentary “Day of Rage” charts in chilling detail how the peaceful transition of power was disrupted by rioters who stormed a seemingly impenetrable seat of government.

The team behind “Day of Rage” will release scenes and other reporting that were left on the cutting room floor on the film’s Twitter account, @dayofrage.
