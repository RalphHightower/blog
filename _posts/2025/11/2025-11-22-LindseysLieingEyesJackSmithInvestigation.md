With apologies to Don Henly and Glenn Frye of The Eagles:

You can’t hide your Senate cries,<br />And your smile is just disguise.<br />Thought you’d cash in on the law,<br />But the House saw through it all.

Acting tough with Emmy flair,<br />Phones were seized, you shout unfair.<br />Bravo echoes through the hall,<br />But it’s taxpayers who foot it all.
