*A sticking point between the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) and [James Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey)’s defense team is whether the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s animus can be imputed to [Lindsey Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/).*

By [Jordan Rubin](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jordan-rubin-ncpn1301611)

Is [Lindsey Halligan](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/comey-james-lindsey-halligan-grand-jury-ask-jordan-rcna241100) a “stalking horse” for [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s revenge against [James Comey](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/james-comey-grand-jury-motion-lindsey-halligan-trump-rcna240838)? The answer could doom the prosecution against the former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) demanded.

The term “stalking horse” has come up in previous cases in which defendants have claimed vindictive prosecution, as [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) does [in a pending motion to dismiss his charges](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/james-comey-vindictive-selective-prosecution-rcna238735) his charges. To establish that hard-to-win claim, defendants must show 1) that the prosecutor acted with genuine animus, and 2) that the defendant wouldn’t have been charged without that animus.

The [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) wants to limit the analysis to Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/)’s motives, while [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey)’s team says the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s ill will against the defendant should be imputed to the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-installed prosecutor, who was previously the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s personal lawyer, lacked prior prosecutorial experience and secured the indictment [over the objection of career prosecutors](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/trump-james-comey-indictment-us-attorney-lindsey-halligan-rcna233853).

In support of their position that imputing [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s animus to [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) is appropriate, [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey)’s lawyers cite case law for the proposition that one way to prove ill intent is by showing that the prosecutor “was prevailed upon to bring the charges by another with animus such that the prosecutor could be considered a ‘stalking horse.’” The [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) argues that the federal appellate circuit covering Virginia, where [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) was indicted, has never endorsed that imputed-animus theory, and the prosecution denies that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has displayed sufficient animus in any event.

Replying to the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/)’s argument on Monday, [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey)’s lawyers [quote from](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.582136/gov.uscourts.vaed.582136.174.0_2.pdf) the [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/)’s [Trump immunity ruling](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf), writing that tracing the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s motives to [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) “is particularly warranted because the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has ‘exclusive authority over the investigative and prosecutorial functions of the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) and its officials.’” They go on to note that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) “has exercised an unprecedented and extraordinary degree of control over the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/), installing his personal allies to key positions and inserting himself into prosecutorial decisions that, in previous Administrations, would have been left to the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/)’s independent judgment.”

Thus, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s extraordinary approach to controlling the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) in general, combined with his extraordinarily specific call for the prosecution of his political opponents, including [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey), could help the defense win this motion, which otherwise would be hard to do.

Lawyers for [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) [Attorney General](https://ag.ny.gov/) [Letitia James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james), whose [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-backed indictment [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) [also secured](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/letitia-james-not-guilty-plea-fraud-indictment-halligan-comey-trump-rcna239548), have made the same “stalking horse” point [in their motion to dismiss](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.583341/gov.uscourts.vaed.583341.53.0.pdf) her charges. [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey)’s litigation on that front is farther along because he was indicted first.

A judge is also considering their motions to dismiss based on the argument that [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) was [unlawfully appointed](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/comey-james-lindsey-halligan-appointment-rcna240482), a distinct legal claim that could get both of their cases dismissed, [regardless of their success on their vindictive prosecution claims](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/james-comey-case-selective-vindictive-prosecution-rcna241620).
