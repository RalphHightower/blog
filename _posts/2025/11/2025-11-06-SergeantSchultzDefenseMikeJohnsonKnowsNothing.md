"Hogan's Heroes" was a [CBS](https://www.cbs.com/) sitcom set in a prisoner-of-war (POW) camp in Nazi Germany during World War II, and centers around a group of Allied prisoners who use the POW camp as an operations base for sabotage and espionage activities directed against Nazi Germany. It ran for 168 episodes (six seasons) from September 17, 1965, to April 4, 1971,

*Confronted with questions he should know how to answer, the [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) leader has proven to be surprisingly ignorant about current events.*

By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

It’s been nearly two weeks since [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) signed one of the most scandalous pardons of his presidency, extending clemency [to Changpeng Zhao](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-house-struggles-defend-trumps-pardon-founder-binance-crypto-exch-rcna239435), founder of the crypto exchange [Binance](https://www.binance.com/), who helped finance the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s stablecoin and put money in the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [family](https://www.trump.com=)’s pockets. The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has since had multiple opportunities to explain why he took such a step, and [he’s failed in humiliating fashion](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/-dont-know-trump-struggles-defend-one-scandalous-pardons-rcna241547).

What does [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Speaker](https://dpesker.house.gov) [Mike Johnson (T-LA4)](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) think about this intensifying controversy, brought to the fore during a [“60 Minutes”](https://www.cbsnews.com/60-minutes/) interview that aired on Sunday night? “I don’t know anything about it,” the [Louisiana Republican](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) said on Monday morning in response to a reporter’s question.

Days earlier, a reporter asked [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) about the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s personnel purge at [Immigration and Customs Enforcement](https://www.ice.gov/) and whether congressional oversight might be in order. The [House](https://www.house.gov/) speaker said [he didn’t know](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3m4b632yykk2i) about that, either.

Five days before that, amid widespread reports about the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) seeking [a \$230 million payment](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-eyes-230-million-payout-justice-dept-repayment-earlier-investiga-rcna238987) from the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/), [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) was asked for comment. [He was again stumped](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3m3ullw6kum2f). A day earlier, he was asked about the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) importing [Argentinian](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/) beef, and the [Louisiana congressman](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) said [he wasn’t up to speed](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3m3s3ojohfu2i) on that, either.

As [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/)’s [Jen Psaki noted in a segment](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/mike-johnson-excuses-trump-investigations-congress-rcna239144) a couple of weeks ago, the [House](https://www.house.gov/) [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) leader has claimed ignorance in recent weeks on everything from [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s crypto dealings to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s reported relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, U.S. citizens being detained by federal immigration agents to a would-be assassin plotting to kill [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Minority Leader](http://democraticleader.house.gov/) [Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY8)](https://jeffries.house.gov/).

In politics, there’s a phrase for Americans who struggle to keep up with day-to-day news and current events and who tend to be ill informed about key issues. They’re known as “low-information voters.”

In 2025, the nation appears to have a low-information [House](https://www.house.gov/) speaker. As this clip from “The Daily Show” helped capture, [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/)’s ignorance has not gone unnoticed.

In fairness, it’s worth emphasizing that there’s an alternate explanation for the frequency of [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/)’s “I don’t know” answers: Maybe the [House](https://www.house.gov/) speaker is actually well informed, and he’s simply pretending to be clueless to avoid answering politically difficult questions.

Or put another way, perhaps [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) is dishonest, not oblivious.

If this is the better explanation, the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) leader is welcome to pitch this defense to the public, though I have a hunch he won’t.
