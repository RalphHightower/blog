[Dr. Annie Andrews](https://drannieandrews.com/), a pediatrician from [Charleston](https://www.charlestonsc.gov/), recently launched her [South Carolina](https://www.sc.gov/) [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) bid with a viral campaign video hitting against her opponent, [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Lindsey Graham (T-SC)](https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/). Even though a [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) has not won a [U.S. Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) seat in [South Carolina](https://www.sc.gov/) in decades, [Dr. Andrews](https://drannieandrews.com/) says her campaign is “about inspiring hope for the folks of [South Carolina](https://www.sc.gov/) who are tired of being left behind.”
