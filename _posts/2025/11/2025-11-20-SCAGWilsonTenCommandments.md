title: "My Dumb State, South Carolina: We've Been Down This Path Before. There Is No State Sponsored Religion"
---

We've been down this path before. The [First Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/) guarantees freedom of religion. There is no state sponsored religion. This opens the floodgates for other religions in public schools, Muslim, Buddhism, …

[Alabama](https://www.alabama.gov/) [Supreme Court](https://judicial.alabama.gov/) Chief Justice Roy Moore installed a statue of the Ten Commandments under the dead of night. He lost in the US Court of Appeals. 

## [Attorney General Alan Wilson supports Louisiana law requiring Ten Commandments to be displayed in public schools - South Carolina Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/news/attorney-general-alan-wilson-supports-louisiana-law-requiring-ten-commandments-to-be-displayed-in-public-schools/)

NOV 13, 2025

([COLUMBIA](https://www.columbiasc.gov/), [S.C.](https://www.sc.gov/)) – ,[South Carolina](https://www.sc.gov/) [Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/) [Alan [Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general/) joined an [18-state coalition](https://republicanags.com/) supporting [Louisiana](https://www.louisiana.gov/)’s law that requires the Ten Commandments to be displayed in public schools in that state. The [attorneys general](https://republicanags.com/) filed a friend-of-the-court brief with the [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit](https://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/), which is hearing an appeal after that court ruled [Louisiana](https://www.louisiana.gov/)’s law is unconstitutional.

“The Ten Commandments are displayed at the [U.S. Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) and on other prominent buildings in [Washington, D.C.](https://dc.gov/), because they have historical significance as one of the foundations of our legal system, and it’s important for our children to learn about them,” [Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/) [Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general/) said. “Our society is healthier and stronger when we have more religion in public life—not less. It is time to end the left’s war on religion.”

The [attorneys general](https://republicanags.com/) point out in their brief that the [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) has “instructed that the Establishment Clause must be interpreted by ‘reference to historical practices and understandings,’” which they argue means [Louisiana](https://www.louisiana.gov/)’s law is constitutional.

“A ‘close look’ at our Nation’s history reveals that ‘no one at the time of the founding was recorded as arguing that the use of religious symbols in public contexts was a form of religious establishment,’” they write in their brief.

Joining [Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/) [Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general/) in the brief are [Kentucky](https://ag.ky.gov/Pages/default.aspx), [Alabama](https://www.alabamaag.gov/), [Alaska](https://law.alaska.gov/), [Arkansas](https://arkansasag.gov/), [Florida](https://www.myfloridalegal.com/), [Idaho](https://www.ag.idaho.gov/), [Indiana](https://www.in.gov/attorneygeneral/), [Iowa](https://www.iowaattorneygeneral.gov/), [Kansas](https://ag.ky.gov/Pages/default.aspx), [Mississippi](https://attorneygenerallynnfitch.com/), [Missouri](https://ago.mo.gov/), [Nebraska](https://ago.nebraska.gov/), [Ohio](https://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/), [South Dakota](https://atg.sd.gov/#gsc.tab=0), [Tennessee](https://www.tn.gov/attorneygeneral.html), [Utah](https://attorneygeneral.utah.gov/), and [West Virginia](https://ago.wv.gov/).
