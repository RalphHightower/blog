## [Lawrence O’Donnell: Epstein scandal poses a serious threat to Trump’s power over his base](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/epstein-scandal-threat-trump-power-rcna225042)

*According to O’Donnell, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is acutely aware of how a fallout over the investigation could “challenge his ability to retain political power.”*

The American public isn’t happy with how [President Donald Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/donald-trump) is handling the [Jeffrey Epstein investigation,](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/lawsuit-epstein-files-foia-trump-administration-rcna224254), that’s according to a new poll shared by Lawrence O’Donnell on Wednesday’s [“The Last Word.”](https://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word)

“The verdict in the court of public opinion is in, and it is not good for [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/),” O’Donnell said, flashing the results of an [Economist/YouGov poll](https://d3nkl3psvxxpe9.cloudfront.net/documents/econtoplines_V8D6b4L.pdf) released this week. According to the survey, 59% of Americans disapprove of the way [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is handling the investigations into Epstein — and just 20% of respondents approved.

O’Donnell said that with dismal numbers like that, “everything [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) does now is an attempt to get 59% of Americans to look the other way.”

The [“The Last Word.”](https://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word) host told viewers to “think about how important this story is to [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s presidency.” According to O’Donnell, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is acutely aware of how a [fallout](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/epstein-files-maxwell-victims-sex-trafficking-rcna223916) over the investigation could “challenge his ability to retain political power.”

“[Republican](https;//www.gop.com/) in Congress have never been afraid of [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/),” O’Donnell continued. “They know he’s a clown who knows nothing. They know he’s a child prone to uncontrollable temper-tantrums. They know he doesn’t belong in the White House. They know he doesn’t belong anywhere in government. They have never been afraid of [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). But [Republican](https;//www.gop.com/) politicians have been very afraid since [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) won the [Republican](https;//www.gop.com/) nomination for president in 2016 — that is when every [Republican](https;//www.gop.com/) politician began living in abject fear of not [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), but [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) voters.”

O’Donnell put it more succinctly: “[Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is nothing without [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) voters.”

The [“The Last Word.”](https://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word) host warned that the controversy over the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s handling of the Epstein investigation risks [fracturing](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/watch/why-maga-turned-on-trump-over-the-epstein-files-243844677747) that usually unwavering support. “[Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s power is completely dependent on support from [Republican](https;//www.gop.com/) voters,” O’Donnell said. “And nothing, nothing has separated [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) from his voters more than the man who has risen from the dead to remind us [he] was ‘[Donald’s closest friend for 10 years,](https://www.thedailybeast.com/now-trump-is-really-scared-by-epstein-biographer/),’ Jeffrey Epstein.”
