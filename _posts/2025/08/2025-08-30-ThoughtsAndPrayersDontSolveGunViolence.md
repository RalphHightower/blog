title: "The Trumpian Trope “Thoughts and Prayers” Doesn’t Solve Gun Violence"
---

Jen Psaki is right. "Thoughts and Prayers" doesn't solve gun violence. Gun laws, background checks. If you want to shoot assault weapons, join the military.

*The ex-[Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) [WH](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) press secretary called Karoline Leavitt’s comments a “waste of time” and said she wouldn't remain silent as those in power refuse to act.*

### Psaki: Action on America's gun problem is NOT HOPELESS

> Jen Psaki addresses the horrific shooting at a Catholic school in Minneapolis and the shocking gun statistics in the United States that "should make everyone angry." Psaki points to new gun legislation that passed under the Biden administration after a mass shooting at a supermarket, and reminds viewers that anger can turn into activism, activism can turn into pressure, and pressure can change laws.

Shortly after news broke of [the shooting at Annunciation Catholic School](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/annunciation-catholic-school-shooting-minneapolis-rcna227514) that left two children dead and 17 other people injured, Psaki [posted on X,](https://x.com/jrpsaki/status/1960730977472237739), “Prayer is not freaking enough. Prayers does not end school shootings. prayers do not make parents feel safe sending their kids to school. Prayer does not bring these kids back. Enough with the thoughts and prayers.”

On Thursday, Leavitt was asked about Psaki’s comments, which the press secretary [called](https://x.com/atrupar/status/1961119537572528432) “incredibly insensitive and disrespectful to the tens of millions of Americans of faith across this country who believe in the power of prayer, who believe that prayer works.”

### Karoline Leavitt calls out Jen Psaki for 'disrespectful' comments on Minneapolis shooting

“It’s utterly disrespectful to deride the power of prayer in this country,” Leavitt added.

> Jen's Version: Jen Psaki answers questions posed in today's White House press briefing, without the Trump administration's spin, and doubles down on her criticism of the Trump White House for taking no action to prevent gun violence and instead wasting time on "bad faith back-and-forth."

Jen Psaki hit back at Karoline Leavitt after the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) press secretary accused her at Thursday’s press briefing of being “disrespectful” to Americans of faith for her comments taking Republicans to task for their inaction on gun violence.

Hours later, during a recurring segment on [“The Briefing”](https://www.msnbc.com/jen-psaki) called “Jen’s Version” — in which the former press secretary responds to questions from that day’s [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) press briefing — Psaki defended her comments and accused the administration of wasting time on “bad-faith back-and-forth.”

“Prayer is a powerful source of comfort for so many people around the world during difficult times, including me,” Psaki said. “I completely feel that way. And what I said yesterday and will say again now, though, is that prayer alone is not enough to prevent and end the crisis of gun violence in America. It’s not.”

The former [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) administration official called Leavitt’s response a “waste of time” and said she would not remain silent as those in power refuse to act. “So the issue I raised yesterday — and I will raise again today, and I will not stop raising — is that people in power like, say, people in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), are using their platforms to do anything other than call for action for sensible [gun safety measures](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/gun-policy-repu).”

Psaki continued, “They’re doing anything but saying what should be done to help prevent tragedies like the shooting in Minneapolis. And because they’re not doing that, frankly, they’re not doing enough, and people shouldn’t accept they’re doing enough.”

The [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) host said that “instead of focusing on the bad-faith back-and-forth,” she hoped that questions for Leavitt’s next briefing would include why the administration doesn’t support popular gun control measures such as [universal background checks or an assault weapons ban.](https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-voters-favor-gun-limits-arming-citizens-reduce-gun-violence).

“To solve this long epidemic of violence requires action,” Psaki said, before quoting a statement from the Catholic group [Sisters of Mercy](https://sistersofmercy.org/news/sisters-of-mercy-statement-on-minnesota-catholic-school-shooting/) on the Minneapolis shooting, which read in part, “Our response can no longer be ‘thoughts and prayers’ alone.”

“Even [Pope Leo](https://www.vatican.va/content/vatican/en.html) (then a cardinal, I will note) retweeted [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Chris Murphy (D-CT)](https://www.murphy.senate.gov/) in 2017, saying, ‘Your cowardice to act cannot be whitewashed by thoughts and prayers,’” Psaki added.
