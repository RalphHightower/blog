## [Why Rupert Murdoch won’t be deposed in Trump’s Epstein defamation lawsuit just yet](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/rupert-murdoch-trump-defamation-lawsuit-epstein-wall-street-journal-rcna223466)

*Per a joint agreement, Murdoch is due to provide health updates to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), who is suing him and others over a Jeffrey Epstein-related story.*

Aug. 6, 2025, 5:12 PM EDT
By [Jordan Rubin](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jordan-rubin-ncpn1301611)

[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s defamation lawsuit against [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/) over a Jeffrey Epstein-related story [seemed like a long shot](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/wall-street-journal-trump-epstein-lawsuit-rcna219968) from the moment it was filed last month. But the suit quickly raised an interesting prospect when [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s lawyers moved to speedily depose [Rupert Murdoch](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/fox-news-dominion-trial-sanctions-rcna79341), whose company publishes the [Journal](https://www.wsj.com/).

Yet, a [joint stipulation](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.693830/gov.uscourts.flsd.693830.27.0_1.pdf) from the parties this week shows that it won’t be happening immediately.

Among the reasons the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s lawyers had cited in seeking the quick deposition was the 94-year-old civil defendant’s health.

“Murdoch recently turned 94 years old and has suffered, but thankfully overcome, multiple health issues throughout his life. Moreover, upon information and belief, Murdoch resides in [New York](https://www.nyc.gov/), [New York](https://www.ny.gov/), which is well over 100 miles from this District,” [they wrote](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.693830/gov.uscourts.flsd.693830.23.0_2.pdf) in the motion, referring to the federal court district in Florida in which they filed [the complaint](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.693830/gov.uscourts.flsd.693830.1.0_3.pdf).

“Thus, it is presumable, both because of his age and health and/or his distance from this Court, that Murdoch will be unavailable for trial,” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s lawyers added.

> *Among the reasons the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s lawyers had cited in seeking the quick deposition was the 94-year-old civil defendant’s health.*

The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s civil complaint was filed in Florida federal court against [Dow Jones & Company Inc.](https://www.dowjones.com/), which publishes the [Journal](https://www.wsj.com/); [News Corp.](http://newscorp.com/), which owns [Dow Jones](https://www.dowjones.com/); Murdoch, director and majority owner of [News Corp.](http://newscorp.com/); [News Corp.](http://newscorp.com/) CEO Robert Thomson; and the [Journal](https://www.wsj.com/) reporters on the story, Khadeeja Safdar and Joseph Palazzolo.

[That story](https://www.wsj.com/politics/trump-jeffrey-epstein-birthday-letter-we-have-certain-things-in-common-f918d796?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAg3zXc0PZ6R159c8B_Nk7NTjlUZYGu-eTJcCLYaRnU2q9pZEjHGCtqe&gaa_ts=687e43cd&gaa_sig=DxKiAsWEZrzyxHAnioY4JWjIpd989E3g29tR4vGxEqiIZ6tYjjqjm7u0unOhPHk3eJgmHf1PoNbFRv78SkcGXQ%3D%3D), published last month, described what the paper called a “bawdy” letter bearing [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s name that was part of a collection of letters given to Epstein by friends of the now-deceased financier for his 50th birthday in 2003 (before his first arrest in 2006). Epstein ded in 2019 while being held on [sex trafficking charges](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/jeffrey-epstein-charged-manhattan-federal-court-sex-trafficking-minors), in what the medical examiner [ruled a suicide](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/medical-examiner-dismisses-doubts-about-epstein-autopsy).

The civil case proceeds against the backdrop of rare political backlash from [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) supporters, over his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s refusal to release all Epstein-related information as promised, [as speculation mounts](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/jeffrey-epstein-ghislaine-maxwell-grand-jury-transcripts-rcna223103) over what sort of deal, if any, his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) might strike with convicted Epstein associate [Ghislaine Maxwell](https://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/watch/lawrence-did-trump-lie-when-he-said-he-didn-t-know-about-ghislaine-maxwell-s-prison-transfer-244423237906).

Getting back to the [joint stipulation](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.693830/gov.uscourts.flsd.693830.27.0_1.pdf) that avoids a quick Murdoch deposition, it says he will give [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) “a sworn declaration describing his current health condition,” as well as regular updates regarding his health, “including a mechanism for him to alert the Plaintiff if there is a material change in his health.”

So even if [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s lawsuit is ultimately unsuccessful in securing the billions of dollars he’s after, as appears likely from the face of the complaint and the known facts to date, the case now serves, if nothing else, as an unlikely forum for the media mogul to update the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) about his health.
