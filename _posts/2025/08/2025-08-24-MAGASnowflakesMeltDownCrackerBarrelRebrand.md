## [Cracker Barrel's new logo sparks a familiar MAGA outrage](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/cracker-barrels-new-logo-sparks-familiar-maga-outrage-rcna226752)

*The Southern-themed restaurant chain has become the latest battleground in an increasingly unpredictable culture war over American identity ‚Äî and who gets to define it.*

This week, American chain restaurant [Cracker Barrel](https://www.crackerbarrel.com/) unveiled a new, streamlined logo, and the internet is in a free fall. The chain, a Southern-themed restaurant found off highways across the country, has become the latest battleground in an increasingly unpredictable culture war over American identity ‚Äî and who gets to define it.

The previous logo, introduced in 1977, featured the outline of an older gentleman wearing overalls, sitting in a chair and leaning his elbow on the eponymous barrel. The new logo strips away ornamentation, leaving only the restaurant‚Äôs name in dark type inside a vaguely barrel-shaped blob.

> *While some on the left seem to be criticizing the aesthetic change, many MAGA enthusiasts and armchair pundits on the far right have read far more into the change.*

I‚Äôve been to a [Cracker Barrel](https://www.crackerbarrel.com/) just once, while on a road trip with a friend from northern [New Jersey](https://www.nj.gov/) to [Austin](https://www.austintexas.gov/government), [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/), when we stopped at a location just off the highway somewhere in northern [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/). The brand, honestly, means very little to me, but I appreciate that it had a personality and a logo that was creative enough to be loved or hated.

In the wake of the new logo reveal, it seems there is [bipartisan](https://x.com/MattWalshBlog/status/1958291424530612365) and widespread outrage over the rebrand. While some on the left seem to be criticizing the aesthetic change, many MAGA enthusiasts and armchair pundits on the far right have read far more into the change. They are not lamenting a design failure; rather, they‚Äôve cast [Cracker Barrel](https://www.crackerbarrel.com/)‚Äôs rebrand as a capitulation to woke liberalism, an erasure of the so-called American ideology that [Cracker Barrel](https://www.crackerbarrel.com/) apparently represents.

Over the past few years, many brands, regardless of industry, have embraced the minimalist block-letter look popularized by Silicon Valley startups in the early 2000s. From luxury fashion brand [Yves Saint Laurent](https://www.forbes.com/sites/onmarketing/2012/07/09/yves-saint-laurent-re-branding-an-icon/) to coffee and doughnut chain [Dunkin‚Äô](https://news.dunkindonuts.com/news/releases-20180925) to financial services company [Mastercard](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/1/7/18172577/mastercard-logo-change-no-words), this strip-down has been everywhere for the past few years. Allegedly, the reason for the prominence of boring and soulless block type is that it simply looks more legible when shrunk down to fit on your phone‚Äôs home screen.

Founded in 1969, [Cracker Barrel](https://www.crackerbarrel.com/) embodies a very specific story of American capitalist success, one tied to postwar growth. If you haven‚Äôt been to a [Cracker Barrel](https://www.crackerbarrel.com/) ever, or recently, it is something of a faux general store. The food is Southern-style and affordable. Interestingly, the knickknacks that famously adorn its walls [are genuine antiques](https://blog.crackerbarrel.com/inside-the-cracker-barrel-decor-warehouse/). Not to be mistaken with nostalgia for the early 2000s and 2010s that is currently proliferating across American culture, [Cracker Barrel](https://www.crackerbarrel.com/)‚Äôs entire ethos is early-1900s nostalgia, steeped in Southern Americana. It is a relic of a bygone era in both origin story and brand aesthetic.

That Southern brand identity is at the root of the outrage. The claim being that the rebrand is the latest nail in the coffin burying American tradition. One conservative consultant [lamented on X](https://x.com/alexbruesewitz/status/1958270205466952033?), ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt stand for this! Return to tradition!‚Äù Another conservative activist [posted](https://x.com/realchrisrufo/status/1958629455125258479?), ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about this particular restaurant chain ‚Äî who cares ‚Äî but about creating massive pressure against companies that are considering any move that might appear to be ‚Äòwokification.‚Äô‚Äù

This is not the first time [Cracker Barrel](https://www.crackerbarrel.com/) has been the subject of far-right ire over the past few years. In 2022, almost three years ago to the day, the chain sparked outrage after adding a breakfast sandwich with [plant-based sausage](https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/cracker-barrel-post-plant-based-sausage-ignites-comment-culture-war-rcna41443) to its morning menu. One user reacted to the company‚Äôs announcement on [Facebook](https://www.facebook com/), writing, ‚ÄúI just lost respect for a once great [Tennessee](https://www.tn.gov/) company.‚Äù Then in June the following year, [Cracker Barrel](https://www.crackerbarrel.com/) incensed half the internet again after posting in support of Pride month and debuting rainbow-colored rocking chairs. Then, [Cracker Barrel](https://www.crackerbarrel.com/) was [derided](https://x.com/FamilyProjectTX/status/1666884627384918017?) for ‚Äúfalling‚Äù to the ‚Äúwoke mob.‚Äù

The far-right outrage over this logo rebrand feels ironic, when, just weeks ago, the same voices now incensed about a new logo derided far-left criticism of an advertisement that was, in my opinion, far more provocative. [My column](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/sydney-sweeney-american-eagle-ad-whiteness-rcna221630) on the now-infamous [Sydney Sweeney advertisement](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/watch/trump-praises-sydney-sweeney-american-eagle-ad-244348997786) advertisement garnered days of rude and pointed emails and social media posts asserting that I was digging up an issue and making an ideological leap where there wasn‚Äôt one to be made.

One person emailed me, including their full legal name and telephone number, in response to what I had written and said, ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt anything be superficial and frivolous? Like simple math. ‚Ä¶ Stop reading so deep into it.‚Äù

I have to say I agree. Sometimes a rebrand really is just a rebrand.
