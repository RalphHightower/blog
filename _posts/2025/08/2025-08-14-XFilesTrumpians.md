There's some weird shit happening at the nation’s capitol: alien abduction, body snatchers, zombies.

## [‘Interdimensional beings’: Some congressional Trumpians head down weird paths](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/interdimensional-beings-congressional-republicans-head-weird-paths-rcna225068)

*[Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Anna Paulina Luna](https://luna.house.gov/) claimed that lawmakers have seen evidence of “interdimensional beings.” She didn't appear to be kidding.*

By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

Thanks to a [radical offensive](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-house-review-smithsonian-exhibits-ensure-trumps-views-are-reflec-rcna224589) from the [White House](https://www.house.gov/), the [Smithsonian](https://www.smithsonian.edu/) has generated far more [political headlines](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-house-review-smithsonian-exhibits-ensure-trumps-views-are-reflec-rcna224589) lately than it’s accustomed to, but it’s a safe bet the institution isn’t accustomed to the kind of criticisms it recently received from [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Eric Burlison](https://burlison.house.gov/).

In an interview that was [published online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpQCbrObsbw) two weeks ago, the [Missouri [Trumpian congressman](https://burlison.house.gov/) appeared on a conservative media outlet and referenced his belief that giant humans once existed. As [Meidas Touch News reported](https://meidasnews.com/news/gop-oversight-member-suggests-smithsonian-hiding-bones-of-giants), [Burlison](https://burlison.house.gov/) specifically said he would appear at “a conference focused on fringe topics including the biblical Nephilim — figures in Genesis that some interpret as the giant offspring of angels and human women.”

After an exchange about angels and [“interdimensional travel,”](https://www.rawstory.com/eric-burlison-2673871421/) [Burlison](https://burlison.house.gov/) added that he believed the [Smithsonian](http://www.si.edu/) might be hiding skeletal evidence that would prove the existence of past giants — and he hoped to use his role on the [House Oversight Committee](https://oversight.house.gov/) to investigate this further.

This week, one of the GOP congressman’s colleagues made some related comments. [The Hill reported](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5451464-luna-lawmakers-evidence-interdimensional-beings/?tbref=hp):

> *[Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Anna Paulina Luna (T-FL13)](https://luna.house.gov/) said during a Wednesday podcast episode with Joe Rogan that lawmakers have seen evidence of ‘interdimensional beings.’ ... ‘I think that they can actually operate through the time spaces that we currently have,’ [Luna](https://luna.house.gov/) said during the podcast.*

Unlike [Burlison](https://burlison.house.gov/), who largely emphasized his personal beliefs, the [Florida [Trumpian](https://luna.house.gov/) suggested on the air that she’s aware of evidence.

“And that’s not something that I came up with on my own. That’s based on stuff that we’ve seen. That’s based on information that we’ve been told,” [Luna](https://luna.house.gov/) told Rogan.

[She added](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/maga-lawmaker-anna-paulina-luna-142715205.html), “What I can tell you without getting into classified conversations is that there have been incidences that I believe were very credible people have reported that there have been movements outside of time and space. Based on the photos that I’ve seen, I’m very confident that there’s things out there that have not been created by mankind.”

Last year, [Minnesota](https://www.mn.gov/) [Gov.](https://mn.gov/governor/) [Tim Walz](https://mn.gov/governor/about-gov/timwalz/) [gained national notoriety](https://apnews.com/article/kamala-walz-vp-weird-trump-gen-z-f9d718890c3ca907f42dba5934075382) when he started telling the public that [Trumpians](https://www.gop.com/) are “just weird.” Occasionally, the Democrat’s comments come to mind.
