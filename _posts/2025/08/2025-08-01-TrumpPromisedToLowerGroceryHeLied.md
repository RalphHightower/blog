## [Trump is bragging about raising prices for American consumers](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-tariffs-trade-war-american-consumers-rcna222278)

*Beneath the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s monthslong roller coaster of tariff threats and walk-backs, Americans are paying the price.*

July 31, 2025, 4:08 PM EDT
By Chris Hayes

This is an adapted excerpt from the July 30 episode of “All In with Chris Hayes.”

On Wednesday, [Donald Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/donald-trump) issued another all-caps trade declaration on social media. “THE AUGUST FIRST DEADLINE IS THE AUGUST FIRST DEADLINE — IT STANDS STRONG, AND WILL NOT BE EXTENDED. A BIG DAY FOR AMERICA!!!” the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) wrote on [Truth Social](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)/posts/114942005076829557).

We are already seeing higher prices on goods people buy every day, from ground beef to coffee to bacon to bananas.

Just over 24 hours later, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) made [another post](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)/posts/114948452793702817), announcing that the [U.S.](https://www.usa.gov/) and [Mexico](https://www.gob.mx/) had agreed to delay the deadline for a trade deal between the two countries by another 90 days.

Now, I follow and report on the news for a living, but I have to come clean and admit that I have really lost the thread on [Trump’s tariffs](https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/-go-to-congress-trump-can-t-impose-tariffs-on-his-own-says-attorney-244127813621). A reason it has been so hard to follow this story is because of the wild, sometimes daily or hourly, back-and-forth we’ve gone through over the past four months.

Do you remember [“Liberation Day?”](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-liberation-day-tariffs-us-economy-rcna198940) It was this huge, ridiculous disaster in the [Rose Garden](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) with [prop tariff boards](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-tariff-chart-taxes-rcna199524). The numbers made no sense at all, with the administration slapping a 10% tariff on the penguins living on otherwise uninhabited islands and 10% on an island group where the only humans are [U.S. military personnel](https://www.jcs.mil/). The tariffs also included a 47% tax on [Madagascar](), our main supplier of the vanilla you might pick up at the grocery store.

It was just too stupid to go forward. The markets [started tanking](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/watch/trump-s-tariffs-drive-historic-stock-market-drop-236597829818) the next day and continued to drop, so just a week later, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) cried “uncle” and [paused nearly all of the tariffs](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/trump-tariffs-president-announces-90-day-pause-what-to-know-rcna200463) he had announced. All except the ones on [China](https://www.gov.cn/). He decided [China](https://www.gov.cn/) had retaliated, and he [increased tariffs on Chinese goods](https://www.msnbc.com/chris-jansing-reports/watch/breaking-trump-orders-90-day-pause-on-some-tariffs-raises-china-s-to-125-236934725917) to 125%, setting off a huge trade war with the world’s second-largest economy.

You might remember that a short time later, container ships from [China](https://www.gov.cn/) [suddenly stopped showing up at U.S. ports](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/22/busiest-us-ports-see-big-drop-in-chinese-freight-vessel-traffic.html), causing [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his tariff gang to freak out about the repercussions if shelves started emptying. So [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), again, called a truce.

After all that, Wall Street started using an acronym to describe the president’s approach to trade: [“TACO,”](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-taco-trade-tariff-european-union-whiplash-rcna209446) or [“Trump always chickens out.”](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) The markets decided the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) simply does not have the nerve to go through with any of these trade threats, so they spent the summer ignoring the back-and-forth.

But actually, beneath that monthslong roller coaster of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s threats and rage and walk-backs, lo and behold, Americans are paying the price. We are already [seeing higher prices on goods](https://www.bls.gov/regions/mid-atlantic/data/averageretailfoodandenergyprices_usandmidwest_table.htm) — from ground beef to coffee to bacon to bananas — and more companies are [announcing price hikes](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/30/trump-tariffs-adidas-tide-pg-prices) on everyday items like laundry detergent, sneakers and more.

The No. 1 thing [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said on the campaign trail is that he would [bring prices down](https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-december-8-2024-n1311184). But just a little more than six months into his second term, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has accomplished the exact opposite — and he’s bragging about it, boasting that the administration has brought in [\$150 billion in tariffs.](https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1950277441982726220). Paid for by American businesses and consumers.

Chris Hayes hosts [“All In with Chris Hayes”](http://www.msnbc.com/all) at 8 p.m. ET Tuesday through Friday on [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/). He is the editor-at-large at [The Nation](https://www.thenation.com/). A former fellow at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/)’s [Edmond J. Safra Foundation Center for Ethics](https://www.ethics.harvard.edu/home), Hayes was a [Bernard Schwartz Fellow](https://www.bernardlschwartz.com/us-economic-policy) at the [New America Foundation](http://newamerica.org/). His latest book is “[The Sirens’ Call: How Attention Became the World’s Most Endangered Resource](https://www.c-span.org/program/book-tv/the-sirens-call-how-attention-became-the-worlds-most-endangered-resource/655543)” ([Penguin Press](https://www.penguin.com/penguin-press-overview/)).
