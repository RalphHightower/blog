## [The 3 biggest problems with the new and unwarranted investigation into Jack Smith](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/3-biggest-problems-new-unwarranted-investigation-jack-smith-rcna222856)

*For years, [Team Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) treated the [Hatch Act](https://osc.gov/Services/Pages/HatchAct.aspx) like a joke. To target [former special counsel Jack Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith), they’ve apparently changed their mind.*

By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

It’s a serious enough problem when [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) publicly endorses investigations into his perceived political foes. But when the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s targets actually become the subject of investigations, it’s far worse. [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/office-special-counsel-launches-investigation-ex-trump-prosecutor-jack-rcna222625):

> *Federal officials are investigating [former special counsel Jack Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) after [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and other prominent [Republicans](https;//www.gop.com/) have alleged that his investigations into then-candidate [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) amounted to illegal political activity. The U.S. [Office of Special Counsel](https://osc.gov/), an independent federal agency, confirmed to NBC News on Saturday that it’s investigating [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) for alleged violations of the [Hatch Act](https://osc.gov/Services/Pages/HatchAct.aspx), a law that prohibits certain political activities by government officials.*

Right off the bat, let’s not overlook the most glaring problem with these developments: There’s literally no evidence whatsoever of [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) engaging in any kind of wrongdoing. Then-[Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Merrick Garland](https://www.justice.gov/ag/bio/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland) tapped [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) to serve as a special counsel in November 2022 — two years before the 2024 presidenial election — at which point he oversaw the federal investigations into [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).

The prosecutor proceeded to collect voluminous evidence, secure indictments and charge [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) with a great many felonies, but at no point did [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) engage in any partisan political activities, making the basis for such an investigation from the U.S. [Office of Special Counsel](https://osc.gov/) absurd.

Just as notably, it seems rather obvious that this move against [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) is part of a larger partisan vendetta from a party that’s eager to retaliate against those who dared to try to hold [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) accountable for his alleged crimes. Indeed, it was [Republican] [Sen.]() [Tom Cotton of Arkansas, a close [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) ally, who [requested](https://x.com/SenTomCotton/status/1950616831397642291) that the [OSC](https://osc.gov/) investigate Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) for “unprecedented interference in the 2024 election,” despite the complete lack of evidence pointing to any interference.

But even if we put these relevant angles aside, there’s a broader point that’s hanging overhead: Since when does the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https;//www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) care about alleged [Hatch Act](https://osc.gov/Services/Pages/HatchAct.aspx) violations? I’m reminded of [this New York Times report](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/09/us/politics/trump-officials-illegal-campaigning.html) report from nearly four years ago:

> *Thirteen of [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald J. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s most senior aides — including his son-in-law and his chief of staff — campaigned illegally for Mr. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s re-election in violation of a law designed to prevent federal employees from abusing the power of their offices on behalf of candidates, a government watchdog agency said Tuesday. Henry Kerner, who heads the [Office of Special Counsel](https://osc.gov/), made the assertion in a withering report that followed a nearly yearlong investigation into ‘myriad’ violations of the law, known as the [Hatch Act](https://osc.gov/Services/Pages/HatchAct.aspx).*

In a [63-page report](https://osc.gov/Documents/Hatch%20Act/Reports/Investigation%20of%20Political%20Activities%20by%20Senior%20Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)%20Administration%20Officials%20During%20the%202020%20President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)ial%20Election.pdf), the [Office of Special Counsel](https://osc.gov/) [concluded](https://osc.gov/News/Pages/21-02-Hatch-Act-Report-RNC.aspx), “[Senior Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https;//www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) officials chose to use their official authority not for the legitimate functions of the government, but to promote the re-election of [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) in violation of the law.”

Richard Painter, who served as the chief [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) ethics lawyer in the [Bush/Cheney White House](https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/), [described](https://twitter.com/RWPUSA/status/1458186787189309444) [Team Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s routine transgressions at the time as “disgusting” and “unprecedented in the history of the [Hatch Act](https://osc.gov/Services/Pages/HatchAct.aspx).” Painter added that the entire [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https;//www.whitehouse.gov/administration/), at the most senior levels, was “devoted to illegally using federal offices to promote the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s political campaign.”

As [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) scandals go, this one was relatively easy to overlook, but what was striking about the [Hatch Act](https://osc.gov/Services/Pages/HatchAct.aspx) controversies was the degree to which the [Republican]() [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s operation broke the rules knowingly and shamelessly, expressing indifference to the ethics law and at times treating it as [the punch-line to a joke](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/kellyanne-conway-reflects-ethics-law-blah-blah-blah-msna1236646).

The rules exist for a reason: The idea of taxpayer-funded political operations is at odds with the basic principles of good government. It’s why walls are supposed to exist between official and political duties — walls that have existed for decades to prevent abuses in [administration](https;//www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)s of both parties.

In [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s first term, those walls were torn down, and members of his [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) team decided that rules and limits just didn’t apply to them. In [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s second term, as the former special counsel finds himself on a partisan enemies list, the public is apparently supposed to believe that [Republicans](https;//www.gop.com/) have suddenly rediscovered their interest in ethics laws, while they target a former special counsel who was always careful to play by the rules.

No one should be fooled.
