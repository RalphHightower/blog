## [Instead of imposing sanctions, Trump finds new ways to give Putin what he wants](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/instead-imposing-sanctions-trump-finds-new-ways-give-putin-wants-rcna224235)

*Despite all of the recent chatter about [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s alleged frustrations with [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/), the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) continues to deliver for the Kremlin.*

Aug. 11, 2025, 8:00 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

In late January, just two days after his second presidential inaugural, [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) told [Russia](http://government.ru/) that if it failed to end its war in [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/) quickly, the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) “[would have no other choice](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)/113872782548137314)” but to impose new economic sanctions. [Vladimir Putin](http://kremlin.ru/) proceeded to ignore the threat, and the [American president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) failed to follow through on his threat.

In early March, [it happened again](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)/114121576367163341): [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) gave [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/) a choice — sanctions or a ceasefire — and the [Russian](http://government.ru/) leader again ignored his American counterpart. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) again failed to follow through. The same thing happened [in late March](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/russia-putin-sanctions-watch-trump-not-says-rcna198900). And [early May](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)/114474136794655068). And [late May](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-major-announcement-russia-sounds-familiar-falls-far-short-rcna218677).

In mid-July, the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) decided to give [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/) more time to resolve a conflict that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) had [promised to end within 24 hours](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/years-late-trump-discovers-russias-war-ukraine-difficult-resolve-rcna215270) of his inauguration. Nearly two weeks ago, on July 29, the [American president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [brought new specificity to his threat](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-starmer-tariffs-china-trade-immigration-israel-gaza-live-updates-rcna221282/rcrd85575?canonicalCard=true), telling reporters that [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/)’s regime had just 10 days to reach a ceasefire agreement with [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/) — the neighboring country it invaded three years ago — or the United States would impose new economic penalties on [Russia](http://government.ru/).

That declaration created a new deadline of Friday, Aug. 8.

Those who predicted that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was serious — this time would be different from all of those other times; this time [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/) had gone too far and earned the [American president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s contempt — were predictably wrong. [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/russia/trump-putin-meeting-ukraine-war-ceasefire-zelenskyy-rcna223589):

> *Just when [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/) and its European allies thought [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was coming round to their view of the war, he appeared to give a huge win to his [Russian](http://government.ru/) counterpart, [Vladimir Putin](http://kremlin.ru/). For [Kyiv](https://kyivcity.gov.ua/), this was [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s deadline to [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/): stop the fighting by Friday or face tough new economic sanctions. Instead, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has handed [Moscow](http://kremlin.ru/) a diplomatic coup by agreeing to meet [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/) face-to-face in a matter of days, their first encounter since the invasion of [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/).*

Complicating matters further, [the [Republican announced](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114995403653615328) that he was welcoming [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/) to American soil — the two are now scheduled to meet in [Alaska](https://www.alaska.gov/) on Friday — handing [Moscow](http://kremlin.ru/) a related diplomatic coup. (Because the [International Criminal Court](https://web.prod.icc-cpi.int/) issued an [arrest warrant for Putin](https://apnews.com/article/icc-putin-war-crimes-ukraine-9857eb68d827340394960eccf0589253), accusing him of war crimes involving the [abduction of Ukrainian children](https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/ukraine-missing-children-taken-by-russia-kherson/index.html), the [Russian](http://government.ru/) dictator generally hasn’t been able to travel outside of his own country. The [American president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) nevertheless invited him to the U.S.)

Just days earlier, [the official [White House line](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/08/08/trump-presidency-news/#link-DMJWT62PLJBP3JA66VIVZP5KJA) was that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was willing to meet with the [Russian](http://government.ru/) leader, but only if [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/) agreed to meet with [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://www.president.gov.ua/). [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) soon after changed the administration’s position.

But wait, there’s more. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) not only abandoned his own sanctions deadline (again), not only invited [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/) onto American soil in exchange for nothing, and not only gave an international pariah the legitimacy he craves, he also [took some time](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3lvw3keufdd2g) at a [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) event on Friday to [assure the world](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-trilateral-agreement-armenia-azerbaijan-august-8-2025/) that [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/) “wants to see peace.”

[Russia](http://government.ru/)’s war — [which has intensified during Trump’s second term](https://x.com/ianbremmer/status/1953451197802619038) — clearly proves otherwise, and [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) himself has [repeatedly suggested](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-insists-wasnt-fooled-russias-putin-record-suggests-otherwise-rcna219081) in recent weeks that [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/) [most certainly does not](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3lthphlgoa42v) want peace.

But the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) vouched for the [Russian](http://government.ru/) leader anyway.

At the same [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) event on Friday afternoon, the [American president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [also suggested](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-trilateral-agreement-armenia-azerbaijan-august-8-2025/) that [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/) might have to agree to let [Russia](http://government.ru/) keep some of the Ukrainian territory that the [Russian](http://government.ru/) military took by force.

In case all of this weren’t quite enough, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [vice president, JD Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/), [said](https://thehill.com/homenews/5445500-vance-done-funding-ukraine-war-business/) on [Faux News](https://https://www.foxnews.com/) over the weekend that the U.S. is “done with the funding of the [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/) war business.” And around the same time, Matthew Whitaker, the [administration(https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s [unfortunate](https://apnews.com/article/trump-matthew-whitaker-nato-ambassador-foreign-policy-173c814ab755ee39d58e7023ff8242a5) [NATO](https://www.nato.int/) ambassador, suggested on CNN that [Russia](http://government.ru/) would likely be rewarded with Ukrainian territory it “earned on the battlefield.”

About a month ago, after [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) teased a “[major statement](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-tariffs-inflation-hasbro-ukraine-patriot-missiles-nato-russia-rcna218125)” about U.S. policy toward [Russia](http://government.ru/), many observers thought the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) might actually do something meaningful. [When that didn’t happen](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-insists-wasnt-fooled-russias-putin-record-suggests-otherwise-rcna219081), there were sighs of relief in Moscow. In fact, [Russian](http://government.ru/) officials were so concerned that the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) might actually try to punish them, that [the Russian stock market soared](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62g6e8zvd4) after [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [signaled weakness again](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-insists-wasnt-fooled-russias-putin-record-suggests-otherwise-rcna219081).

A month later, after [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) again backed off his threats and invited [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/) to American soil, the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s pitiful position was [greeted with cheers in Russia](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/08/10/putin-trump-russia-ukraine-summit/) once more.

That’s understandable: As an analysis in [The New York Times explained](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/10/world/europe/ukraine-trump-putin-summit.html), the [American president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has given his [Russian](http://government.ru/) counterpart [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/)’s “ideal summit,” without having to do much of anything.

Sam Greene, a professor of [Russian](http://government.ru/) politics at [Kings College](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/index) [London](https://www.london.gov.uk/home-page), told the [Times](https://www.nytimes.com/), “It has been a very good week for [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/).” There’s ample evidence to bolster the point, though I’d add that with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), it’s been a very good seven months for [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/), too.
