## [Trump floats radical new threats against those who say what he doesn’t want to hear](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-floats-radical-new-threats-say-doesnt-want-hear-rcna226936)

*[Wes Moore](https://governor.maryland.gov/leadership/Pages/governor.aspx), [Chris Christie](https://chrischristie.com/) and [Muriel Bowser](https://mayor.dc.gov/biography/muriel-bowser) told the public the truth. Presidential threats soon followed.*

Aug. 25, 2025, 7:55 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

[Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has made no secret of his contempt for crime statistics. Indeed, after the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [militarized the nation’s capital](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-democrats-strategy-washington-dc-police-national-guard-rcna225710), prompting observers to note that crime rates are [down across the board](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trumps-unprecedented-takeover-dc-police-comes-crime-figures-show-rcna224376) in [Washington, D.C.](https://dc.gov/) — violent crime rates, in particular, have reached [a 30-year low](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trumps-unprecedented-takeover-dc-police-comes-crime-figures-show-rcna224376) — [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) didn’t just condemn the data, his [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) [even launched an investigation](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/justice-department-launches-investigation-dc-crime-data-trumps-complai-rcna226085) into the statistics he doesn’t like.

But that, evidently, wasn’t enough. On Friday morning, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) specifically [targeted [Muriel Bowser](https://mayor.dc.gov/biography/muriel-bowser), the [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [mayor](https://mayor.dc.gov/) of the [District of Columbia](https://dc.gov/), for pointing to official data that conflicts with his perceptions. “[Mayor](https://mayor.dc.gov/) [Muriel Bowser](https://mayor.dc.gov/biography/muriel-bowser) must immediately stop giving false and highly inaccurate crime figures, or bad things will happen,” [the Republican wrote](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)/115070876988527695) to his social media platform.

Two days later, after former [New Jersey](https://www.nj.gov/) [Gov.](https://www.nj.gov/governor/) [Chris Christie](https://chrischristie.com/) criticized [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) during an appearance on [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/)’ [“This Week,”](https://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek) this also generated a related [presidential](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) threat. [The New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/25/us/politics/trump-chris-christie-bridgegate.html):

> *[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) on Sunday threatened to investigate former Gov. [Chris Christie](https://chrischristie.com/) of [New Jersey](https://www.nj.gov/) over a 2013 political scandal, days after the [F.B.I.](https://www.fbi.gov/) raided the home and office of another former [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) official turned critic. [Mr. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) made the threat on social media after [Mr. Christie](https://chrischristie.com/) said during an appearance on [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/) that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) ‘doesn’t care’ about maintaining a separation between his office and criminal investigations.*

In case that wasn’t quite enough, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) apparently also saw [Maryland](https://www.maryland.gov/) [Gov.](https://governor.maryland.gov/) [Wes Moore](https://governor.maryland.gov/leadership/Pages/governor.aspx) on [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/)’ [“Face the Nation,”](https://www.cbsnews.com/face-the-nation/) leading [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to pitch yet another threat. [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-threatens-military-baltimore-crime-key-bridge-funding-chicago-rcna226846):

> *The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) on Sunday also threatened to pull federal funding for the replacement of the [Francis Scott Key Bridge](https://www.baltimorecity.gov/sites/default/files/key-bridge-response-0424-en-web.pdf), which collapsed in 2024. The federal government had previously agreed to pay for the bridge’s replacement. ‘I gave Wes [Moore](https://governor.maryland.gov/leadership/Pages/governor.aspx) a lot of money to fix his demolished bridge,’ [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wrote. ‘I will now have to rethink that decision???’*

The published threat was accompanied by [nonsensical claims](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)/115084149454997135) about crime rates in [Baltimore](https://www.baltimorecity.gov/) — a city that’s seen its murder rate drop to [to a 50-year low](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/19/nx-s1-5503390/baltimore-mayor-brandon-scott-low-crime-rates) — and [an attack](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)/115084162750679122) on the [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [governor](https://governor.maryland.gov/)’s military service. ([Moore](https://governor.maryland.gov/leadership/Pages/governor.aspx) is a decorated combat veteran who served in [Afghanistan](https://moi.gov.af/).)

The specific details are obviously relevant. Not only did [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) lie about [Baltimore](https://www.baltimorecity.gov/) and about [Moore](https://governor.maryland.gov/leadership/Pages/governor.aspx)’s service record, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) also claimed he “gave” the governor federal funds to replace the [Francis Scott Key Bridge](https://www.baltimorecity.gov/sites/default/files/key-bridge-response-0424-en-web.pdf), which (a) is not how the appropriations process works in the United States; and (b) is at odds with the simple fact that the funding was approved by [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) and signed into law by [Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) before [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) returned to the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).

But to the hear the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) tell it, he maintains total control over U.S. investments, which he can approve or curtail based on his whims.

The common thread isn’t exactly well hidden: [Bowser](https://mayor.dc.gov/biography/muriel-bowser), [Christie](https://chrischristie.com/) and [Moore](https://governor.maryland.gov/leadership/Pages/governor.aspx) told the public facts that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) didn’t want to hear, and [presidential](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) threats soon followed.

Indeed, hours after targeting the former [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) governor and incumbent [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) governor, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), for good measure, proceeded to [threaten](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)/115086929873163909) [ABC](https://abcnews.go.com/) and [NBC](https://www.nbcnews.com/) ([twice](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)/115087160158530143)) for airing news coverage that he disapproved of.

Brendan Nyhan, a political scientist at [Dartmouth College](https://home.dartmouth.edu/dartmouth), [told The Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/bob-uecker-milwaukee-brewers-mr-baseball-4cbb3ccf166f8eeb1bbf04dc28f6aa90?click=primis) the other day, “The picture is pretty clear for anyone who’s read a history book what kind of [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) we’re dealing with.” The quote resonates for a reason.
