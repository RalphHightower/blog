2025-03-17: [Canada Considers Buying Fighter Jets From Europe Instead Of US Due To Trump’s Instability and Unpredictable Continued Membership In NATO. Lockheed Martin Loses Contract Of F-35 Jets Worth $19 Billion]({% link _posts/2025/03/2025-03-17-TrumpTradeWarWithWorldJustLostDefenseOrderCanada.md %})

## [U.S. allies think twice about buying F-35s in response to Trump’s antics](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/f-35-fighter-jets-us-allies-switzerland-spain-france-rcna224350)

*Why is the list of countries reassessing their [F-35](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/products/f-35.html) purchases still growing? Because of the lack of international confidence in the American [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).*

Aug. 11, 2025, 1:33 PM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

Four years ago, as [Switzerland](https://www.admin.ch/) prepared to make some military investments, [French](https://www.info.gouv.fr/composition-du-gouvernement) [President](https://www.elysee.fr/emmanuel-macron) [Emmanuel Macron](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/frances-macron-fact-checks-trump-real-time-claim-ukraine-rcna193624) urged [Swiss](https://www.admin.ch/) officials to invest in a [French](https://www.info.gouv.fr/composition-du-gouvernement)-made fighter jet called the [Dassault Rafale](https://www.dassault-aviation.com/fr/defense/rafale/). The lobbying didn’t work, and [Switzerland](https://www.admin.ch/) instead opted for the United States’ [F-35s](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/products/f-35.html).

In hindsight, the decision isn’t holding up especially well.

The [Trump administration](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-deploy-national-guard-dc-place-local-police-federal-control-rcna224303) recently let [Swiss](https://www.admin.ch/) officials know that the cost of the planes will be more than previously estimated. The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) soon after hit [Switzerland](https://www.admin.ch/) with harsh trade tariffs. As [Politico reported](https://www.politico.eu/article/switzerland-f-35-deal-donald-trumps-tariff-bombshell-trade-war-eu-us-jets/), the developments are not sitting well in [Bern](https://www.admin.ch/gov/).

> *An order for 36 [F-35 jets](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/products/f-35.html) may become a casualty of [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s trade war against [Switzerland](https://www.admin.ch/) as political opposition to the multibillion-franc defense deal surges in [Bern](https://www.admin.ch/gov/).*

> *The backlash follows the [U.S. president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s decision to hit [Swiss](https://www.admin.ch/) exports with a 39 percent tariff — the highest levied on any developed country and more than double the rate imposed on the [European Union](https://european-union.europa.eu/).*

- In fairness, it’s worth emphasizing that [Switzerland](https://www.admin.ch/) hasn’t canceled its investment, but there is an effort underway in the [Swiss Parliament](https://discoverswiss.ch/federal-assembly-of-switzerland/) to end the order.

Just as notable is the familiarity of the circumstances. A few days before the [Politico](https://www.politico.com/) report was published on developments in the [Swiss](https://www.admin.ch/) capital, [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/) published a related article about a similar issue unfolding roughly 1,000 miles away.

> *[Spain](https://administracion.gob.es/) is no longer considering the option of buying U.S.-made [F-35 fighter jets](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/products/f-35.html) and is choosing between European-made [Eurofighter](https://www.eurofighter.com/) and the so-called [Future Combat Air System (FCAS)](https://www.airbus.com/en/products-services/defence/future-combat-air-system-fcas), a defense ministry spokesperson said on Wednesday.*

> *The spokesperson was confirming an earlier report by [El Pais newspaper](https://elpais.com/) that the government had shelved plans to buy the [F-35](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/products/f-35.html), which is manufactured by U.S. aerospace giant [Lockheed Martin](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/).*

We can keep going. In March, a leading defense official [Denmark](https://regeringen.dk/) acknowledged his country’s [F-35](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/products/f-35.html) purchases, but [expressed regret over the decision](https://www.yahoo.com/news/denmarks-defense-committee-head-said-043056367.html). “[B]uying American weapons is a security risk that we cannot run,” [Rasmus Jarlov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rasmusjarlov/), the chair of [Denmark](https://regeringen.dk/)’s parliamentary defense committee wrote on social media, adding: “We must avoid American weapons if at all possible.”

[Portugal also lost interest](https://www.politico.eu/article/portugal-rules-out-buying-f-35s-because-of-trump/) in [F-35s](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/products/f-35.html), as did [Canada](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/f35-blair-trump-1.7484477).

Usually, when there’s political interest in [F-35s](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/products/f-35.html), it’s related to [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and [his apparent belief that the airplanes are literally invisible](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-genuinely-seems-believe-f-35s-are-literally-invisible-n1131361). But as traditional U.S. allies reassess their willingness to purchase the jets, it’s a lot less funny.

[New York magazine](https://nymag.com/) had a [memorable report](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-f-35-fighter-jet-allies.html) on this in March:

> *Not so long ago, the [F-35 fighter jet](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/products/f-35.html) was the hottest ticket in the international arms market. ... Stealthy, supersonic, and able to both dogfight and strike targets on the ground, it’s arguably the most sophisticated weapon in the U.S. arsenal and undeniably the most sought-after. As nation after nation held competitions to choose their next frontline fighter, the [F-35](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/products/f-35.html) came in and trounced its rivals time and again. ...*

> *But then, earlier this month, something happened. One after another, nations that had signed up for the [F-35](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/products/f-35.html) started voicing qualms. ... Nothing had changed about the plane’s performance. It’s just that, in the eyes of some international customers, the [F-35](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/products/f-35.html) can’t fully be trusted anymore because of who is the [commander-in-chief](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).*

Five months later, the problem appears to have gotten worse, not better.
