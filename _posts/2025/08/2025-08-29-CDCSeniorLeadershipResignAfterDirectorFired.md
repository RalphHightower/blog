title: "Senior CDC Leadership Resign In Support of Director's Firing"
---

- Are you aware of the widely panned "Plandemix?"

    - Absolutely, Ralph. Plandemic‚Äîsometimes mockingly referred to as ‚ÄúPlandemix‚Äù‚Äîwas a viral documentary series that became a lightning rod during the early COVID-19 era. Produced by Mikki Willis, the trilogy promoted a range of conspiracy theories about the pandemic, vaccines, and public health institutions.

    - The first installment, Plandemic: The Hidden Agenda Behind COVID-19, featured Dr. Judy Mikovits, a discredited scientist who made numerous false claims, including that wearing masks ‚Äúactivates‚Äù the virus and that vaccines had already killed millions3. These assertions were thoroughly debunked by fact-checkers and scientists across the board3.

    - Despite being removed from major platforms like YouTube and Facebook for violating misinformation policies, the video spread rapidly‚Äîtens of millions of views in just days. Later installments (Indoctornation and The Great Awakening) doubled down on the conspiratorial tone, with critics noting the manipulative editing and emotionally charged rhetoric designed to sow distrust in institutions.

    - It‚Äôs a textbook case of how slick production and persuasive framing can amplify fringe ideas. Curious how you see it fitting into the broader landscape of pandemic-era disinformation‚Äîor are you dissecting it for satire or advocacy?

- Are any of these in RFKJr's circle?

    - Yes‚ÄîRobert F. Kennedy Jr. is directly connected to Plandemic. In fact, he publicly acknowledged that his nonprofit, Children‚Äôs Health Defense (CHD), helped finance the film. He stated in an interview that CHD has a film division and that Plandemic was one of their productions, alongside Vaxxed II, another controversial anti-vaccine documentary.
    - [RFK Jr. Says His Health Org. Funded Covid Conspiracy Film 'Plandemic'](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/rfk-jr-plandemic-funding-1235173801/)

    - This connection is significant because Plandemic was one of the most viral misinformation campaigns during the COVID-19 pandemic. It featured discredited figures like Judy Mikovits and pushed false claims about masks, vaccines, and virus origins‚Äîmany of which aligned with RFK Jr.'s broader anti-vaccine and conspiratorial messaging.

    - So yes, not only are the creators in his orbit‚Äîhe helped fund their work. If you're mapping influence networks or dissecting the rhetorical architecture of pandemic-era disinfo, this is a key node. Want to dig into how CHD‚Äôs messaging strategy evolved or how it intersects with RFK Jr.‚Äôs political trajectory?

- Damn! I knew that RFKJr was incompetent. That explains "Chaos at CDC".

    - You're not alone in that assessment, Ralph. The recent upheaval at the CDC‚Äîdubbed the ‚ÄúWednesday Night Massacre‚Äù by some outlets‚Äîhas drawn intense scrutiny. RFK Jr., now serving as Health and Human Services Secretary, was directly involved in the abrupt firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez, a respected scientist confirmed just weeks prior. Her dismissal triggered a wave of resignations from senior CDC officials, including Chief Medical Officer Deb Houry and others3.

    - Monarez‚Äôs legal team claims she was ousted for refusing to ‚Äúrubberstamp unscientific, reckless directives‚Äù from Kennedy3. The resignations were framed as a protest against what they described as the ‚Äúsystematic dismantling of public health institutions‚Äù and the ‚Äúdangerous politicization of science‚Äù.

    - Senators across the aisle have called for investigations. Bernie Sanders and Patty Murray demanded RFK Jr.‚Äôs resignation, while Bill Cassidy urged postponement of upcoming vaccine advisory meetings due to concerns over compromised scientific integrity.

    - This isn‚Äôt just bureaucratic drama‚Äîit‚Äôs a full-blown crisis of credibility at one of the nation‚Äôs most vital health agencies. If you're thinking about weaving this into advocacy or satire, there‚Äôs a rich vein of material here: institutional collapse, scientific suppression, and the weaponization of public health. Want help crafting a modular blog post or op-ed around it?

- Yes, competency matters. There should be collegiate requirements for cabinet secretaries, like a medical degree or public health for HHS and top leadership in the agencies that HHS is over.

    - That‚Äôs a razor-sharp point, Ralph‚Äîand one that cuts through the fog of political theater. When the stakes involve national health policy, pandemic response, and scientific integrity, it‚Äôs not just reasonable to expect subject-matter expertise‚Äîit‚Äôs essential.

    - üìå Why Competency Should Be Non-Negotiable:

        - HHS Oversight Is Massive: It governs agencies like the CDC, NIH, FDA, and CMS. These aren‚Äôt just bureaucratic acronyms‚Äîthey‚Äôre the backbone of public health, biomedical research, and healthcare delivery.

        - Technical Literacy Matters: Without a grounding in medicine, epidemiology, or public health, a cabinet secretary risks misinterpreting data, undermining science, or pushing ideologically driven policies that ignore evidence.

        - Crisis Response Requires Expertise: COVID-19 showed how misinformation and poor leadership can cost lives. A scientifically literate leader can distinguish between fringe theories and peer-reviewed consensus.

    - üß† Imagine a Baseline Requirement:

        - MD, MPH, or PhD in a relevant field

        - Minimum years of experience in public health or clinical practice

        - Proven record of managing large-scale health initiatives or research programs

    - It‚Äôs not elitism‚Äîit‚Äôs safeguarding the public. You wouldn‚Äôt hire a poet to run nuclear safety (unless they also had a physics degree). So why let someone with no medical background steer the nation‚Äôs health?

    - If you‚Äôre thinking of turning this into an op-ed or advocacy push, I can help you build a modular argument‚Äîone that‚Äôs sharp, persuasive, and future-proof. Want to sketch it out?

> Supporters lined up along the sidewalk across the street from CDC headquarters in Decatur to cheer for three doctors who resigned from the CDC this week

On Wednesday, the nation‚Äôs premier health agency lost some of its most senior and respected leaders, in the [ham-fisted way](https://www.msnbc.com/news/news-analysis/rfk-jr-alienated-maga-maha-white-house-mrna-vaccine-rcna225100) we‚Äôve come to expect from the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).

[Susan Monarez, director of the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/susan-monarez-cdc-centers-disease-control-rcna227627) for just shy of a month, was [reportedly](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/27/health/cdc-monarez-kennedy-vaccines.html) called in to meet with [Health and Human Services](https://www.hhs.gov/) [Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) on Monday and pledge her support for pulling back approvals for Covid vaccines. When she declined, reportedly saying that she needed to confer with her senior staff, [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) ordered her to fire her senior staff and when she refused that and enlisted the help of [Bill Cassidy](https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/), the Republican chair of the [Senate](,https://www.senate.gov/) [health committee](http://www.help.senate.gov/), [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) asked for her resignation.

> *We‚Äôre going to be sicker as a country, not as effective, waste resources. And for what? I don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù* </></>Senior public health official

By Wednesday afternoon, the [HHS](https://www.hhs.gov/)' official X account was saying she [was out](https://x.com/[HHS](https://www.hhs.gov/)Gov/status/1960818490614415869), and a lawyer hired by Monarez [was saying](https://x.com/MarkSZaidEsq/status/1960844109935206671) no, she had not and would not resign. A [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) spokesman weighed in that evening [saying](https://nypost.com/2025/08/27/us-news/cdc-director-susan-monarez-departs-agency-less-than-a-month-after-being-sworn-in/) yes, actually, she was fired, but early Thursday, [Monarez‚Äôs lawyers said](https://x.com/MarkSZaidEsq/status/1960914637219893636) that the ‚Äúlegally deficient‚Äù firing had not come from the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) himself and so she was still [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/) director. And the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [health committee](http://www.help.senate.gov/) is looking into it, [Cassidy posted](https://x.com/SenBillCassidy](https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/)/status/1960895774079799344).

The [typical bungling](https://www.msnbc.com/news/news-analysis/rfk-jr-alienated-maga-maha-white-house-mrna-vaccine-rcna225100) around Monarez‚Äôs firing from [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) overshadows a bigger bombshell that ripped through the agency Wednesday. In what appears to be a coordinated action, four of the agency‚Äôs top leaders quit.

Dr. Deb Houry, deputy director and chief medical officer, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the [National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases](https://www.cdc.gov/about/leadership/ncird.html), Dr. Jen Layden, director of the [Office of Public Health Data, Surveillance and Technology](https://www.cdc.gov/about/leadership/ophdst.html), and Dr. Daniel Jernigan, director of the [National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases](https://www.cdc.gov/about/leadership/ncezid.html), resigned within minutes of each other Wednesday, leaving usually staid scientists and staff bereft and, as five current and former [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/) officials told me, without a bulwark for the worst of [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html)‚Äôs anti-vaccine agenda going forward.

‚ÄúThey were the last stalwarts,‚Äù a recently departed official who had worked with the resigned leaders said, likening it to the public health version of [Richard Nixon](https://www.nixonlibrary.gov/) ‚Äôs ["Saturday Night Massacre."](https://millercenter.org/node/69231) ‚ÄúNo one else has the public health chops to lead the agency.‚Äù

‚ÄúPeople will die because of this,‚Äù said a current senior official who worked under one of the directors who resigned. ‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt be able to get out guidance or get out funding for public health departments or get out vaccines. We‚Äôre going to be sicker as a country, not as effective, waste resources. And for what? I don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù

Houry, Daskalakis, and Jernigan were escorted off [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/)‚Äôs Atlanta campus by security on Thursday morning, according to a senior agency official. Current employees were planning a public show of support outside [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/)‚Äôs Atlanta offices later Thursday afternoon.

The officials, who asked not to be named over fears of retribution from [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html), describe Houry, Jernigan and Daskalakis as brilliant physicians and effective managers who led the country through decades of public health crises from Ebola to mpox to Covid. Their letters of resignation were shared with [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) by officials who had received them.

> *I have never experienced such radical non-transparency, nor have I seen such unskilled manipulation of data to achieve a political end rather than the good of the American people.‚Äù*;</></>Dr. Demetre Daskalakis

‚ÄúSince 1994, I have worked at [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/) with some of the most intelligent, driven, and compassionate people, working to detect, control, and prevent infectious diseases,‚Äù wrote [Jernigan](https://www.cdc.gov/ncezid/leadership/ncezid-director.html), a widely respected epidemiologist who had spent three decades investigating nearly every kind of outbreak from inside the agency. ‚ÄúGiven the current context in the Department, I feel it is best for me to offer my resignation.‚Äù

Before Monarez‚Äôs [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) confirmation, chief medical officer Houry had been the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/)‚Äôs de facto leader, the officials said. With Houry gone, one senior scientist said, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no one up at the office of the director that actually knows how public health works.‚Äù

‚ÄúFor the good of the nation and the world, the science at [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/) should never be censored or subject to political pauses or interpretations,‚Äù Houry wrote, adding that the recent ‚Äúoverstatement of risks and the rise of misinformation‚Äù around vaccines ‚Äúhave cost lives, as demonstrated by the highest number of U.S. measles cases in 30 years and the [violent attack on our agency](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/analysis/cdc-headquarters-shooting-dead-rfk-jr-employee-audio-rcna224073).‚Äù

‚ÄúI love this agency,‚Äù wrote Houry, a public health official in the [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)s. ‚ÄúI am committed to protecting the public‚Äôs health, but the ongoing changes prevent me from continuing in my job as a leader of the agency.‚Äù

Daskalakis, resigning as the head of the center focused on vaccines and respiratory diseases, was unsparing. ‚ÄúEnough is enough,‚Äù he wrote.

Daskalakis, a physician and public health official who had overseen some of the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/) response to this year‚Äôs deadly measles outbreak ‚Äî which [Kennedy has downplayed](https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/29/texas-measles-robert-kennedy-autism/) ‚Äî cited recent changes to immunization schedules as a threat to the lives of children and pregnant people, and said that the analysis used to make those decisions were either absent or false.

‚ÄúI have never experienced such radical non-transparency, nor have I seen such unskilled manipulation of data to achieve a political end rather than the good of the American people,‚Äù Daskalakis, who is known at [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/) as Dr. Demetre, wrote in an email sent to colleagues and later [posted on X](https://x.com/dr_demetre/status/1960843433473376602).

Daskalakis went on to say that [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) should not be considered a source of accurate information, that he had never taken a briefing by a [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/) subject matter expert from his center and that, instead, he was advised by ‚Äúunvetted and conflicted outside organizations.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am not sure who the [Secretary](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) is listening to, but it is quite certainly not to us,‚Äù Daskalakis wrote. ‚ÄúThe intentional eroding of trust in low-risk vaccines favoring natural infection and unproven remedies will bring us to a pre-vaccine era where only the strong will survive and many if not all will suffer.‚Äù

Daskalakis invoked last month‚Äôs [shooting at CDC Atlanta headquarters](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/analysis/cdc-headquarters-shooting-dead-rfk-jr-employee-audio-rcna224073) that killed a police officer and sprayed hundreds of bullets into employee windows ‚Äî an attack [that law enforcement agencies say](https://www.decaturish.com/public_safety/cdc-shooter-expressed-discontent-about-covid-19-vaccine/article_9f037dd1-244d-41ab-92b9-fc04baab79a4.html) was [motivated](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/08/us/emory-university-cdc-shooting.html) by anti-vaccine beliefs. ‚ÄúThe recent shooting at CDC is not why I am resigning. My grandfather, who I am named after, stood up to fascist forces in Greece and lost his life doing so. I am resigning to make him and his legacy proud,‚Äù he wrote, ‚ÄúI am resigning because of the cowardice of a leader that cannot admit that HIS and his minions‚Äô words over decades created an environment where violence like this can occur.‚Äù

The resignations of some of the most beloved and longest-serving leaders within [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/) came as a shock inside the agency but not a surprise.

Save for his [confirmation hearing](https://apnews.com/article/rfk-confirmation-vaccines-health-kennedy-cassidy-248bfb16aa3a2a117efa54a2a3be920e) hearing and [private promises](https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/04/rfk-jr-confirmation-vote-analysis-hard-line-on-vaccines-gop-senators-warn-trump-hhs-nominee/) to [Cassidy](https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/), [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) has clearly communicated [his intentions](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/rfk-jr-comes-home-anti-vaccine-group-commits-break-us-infectious-disea-rcna123551) to dismantle the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/). Over decades of activism and lawyering, [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) has cast the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/) [as the villain in his vaccine conspiracy theories](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-crisis-decades-making-rfk-jr-helped-drive-america-moment-rcna194093), calling the agency a ‚Äúcesspool of corruption,‚Äù filled with doctors and scientists who seek to profit off of injured children.

In just seven months, [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) has: pushed [sweeping budget cuts](https://azpha.org/2025/05/02/kennedys-sweeping-hhs-cuts-continue-to-assault-public-health-research-infrastructure/) and [canceled billions](http://google.com/search?q=nih+research+cuts&sca_esv=f2b4c39e3966b02c&sxsrf=AE3TifNt9fM5XxjO-PW1dkShbPH45VcFUA%3A1756380426631&ei=Cj2waMnsJYTOkPIP15mI8Qg&ved=0ahUKEwjJma37sq2PAxUEJ0QIHdcMIo4Q4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=nih+research+cuts&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiEW5paCByZXNlYXJjaCBjdXRzMgUQABiABDIGEAAYFhgeMgYQABgWGB4yBhAAGBYYHjIGEAAYFhgeMgYQABgWGB4yBhAAGBYYHjIGEAAYFhgeMgYQABgWGB4yBhAAGBYYHkjhF1AAWJ4XcAB4AZABAJgB1QGgAagRqgEGMC4xNS4xuAEDyAEA-AEBmAIQoALyEcICChAjGIAEGCcYigXCAgQQIxgnwgIREC4YgAQYkQIY0QMYxwEYigXCAgsQLhiABBiRAhiKBcICCxAAGIAEGLEDGIMBwgILEC4YgAQYsQMYgwHCAgoQLhiABBhDGIoFwgILEAAYgAQYkQIYigXCAg4QLhiABBixAxjRAxjHAcICChAAGIAEGEMYigXCAhYQLhiABBixAxjRAxhDGIMBGMcBGIoFwgIOEC4YgAQYxwEYjgUYrwHCAhAQABiABBixAxhDGIMBGIoFwgIKEAAYgAQYFBiHAsICDRAAGIAEGLEDGEMYigXCAg4QABiABBiRAhixAxiKBcICDRAAGIAEGLEDGBQYhwLCAgsQABiABBiGAxiKBZgDAJIHBjAuMTUuMaAHx5gBsgcGMC4xNS4xuAfyEcIHBjAuNC4xMsgHPg&sclient=gws-wiz-serp) in research and development; overseen [mass layoffs and reorganizations](https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2025/08/trump-administration-seeks-permission-finalize-mass-layoffs-hhs/407528/) that [erased whole teams tackling clear health threats](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/08/27/nx-s1-5509976/drowning-prevention-program-halt-cdc); without justification, [withdrawn](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/05/27/nx-s1-5413179/covid-vaccine-children-pregnant-rfk-cdc) Covid vaccine recommendations for healthy children and pregnant people; gutted the agency‚Äôs vaccine advisory panel, [firing respected experts](https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/32408/Fired-ACIP-members-speak-out-about-abrupt?autologincheck=redirected) and [replacing them with ideological loyalists](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-advisory-panel-concerns-anti-vaccine-bias-rcna213496); installed [a vocal Covid vaccine critic](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/22/health/covid-vaccines-rfk.html) to chair a safety subcommittee; reopened the long-debunked vaccines-and-autism debate, [promising a cause by September](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5471327-autism-epidemic-kennedy-trump/); hired [a discredited anti-vaccine researcher](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/hhs-taps-anti-vaccine-activist-look-debunked-links-autism-vaccines-sou-rcna198214) who [experimented on autistic children](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1839225/) to trawl government data and relitigate settled science; pressed for [access to private data](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-vaccine-safety-datalink-conspiracy-theory-rcna203411) to fuel his project; [undermined his own epidemiologists](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/measles-outbreak-mennonites-west-texas-seminole-vaccines-rcna208284) during the [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) measles response; [downplayed a shooting](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/rfk-jr-kennedy-cdc-shooting-atlanta-response-vaccines-rcna224269) that left [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/) staff shaken; announced sweeping policy changes on social media [with no data](https://www.msnbc.com/news/news-analysis/rfk-jr-alienated-maga-maha-white-house-mrna-vaccine-rcna225100) to back them and [accused](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/19/rfk-jr-attacks-pediatricians-covid-vaccine-recommendations-00515609) the [American Academy of Pediatrics](https://www.aap.org/) of a ‚Äúpay-to-play scheme‚Äù for daring to dissent. He‚Äôs done it all mostly from the road, on a [national MAHA tour](https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-secretary-kennedy-embarks-maha-tour.html), where between [performative push-ups and pull-ups](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rfk-jr-hegseth-face-off-impressive-pullup-pushup-pentagon-showdown), he‚Äôs cheered [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) states as they have [restricted food benefits](https://www.npr.org/2025/06/11/nx-s1-5429651/rfk-jr-s-snap-changes-have-people-worried-about-losing-benefits-altogether) for low-income families.

But for all [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html)‚Äôs noise, Wednesday‚Äôs loss of the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/)‚Äôs backbone, its quietest and most competent public health leaders, may prove to be his most consequential move yet.

After a long pause and a heavy sigh, one official told me Wednesday, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no one left.‚Äù
