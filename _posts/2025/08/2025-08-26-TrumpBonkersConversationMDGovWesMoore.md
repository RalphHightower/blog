## [Trump’s made-up conversation about Maryland Gov. Wes Moore is part of a weird pattern](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-made-conversation-maryland-gov-wes-moore-part-weird-pattern-rcna227226)

*As [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) boasts about imaginary conversations and points to unnamed sources who’ve labeled him “the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) of Europe,” there's cause for concern.*

Aug. 26, 2025, 10:51 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

[Gov.](https://governor.maryland.gov/) [Wes Moore](https://governor.maryland.gov/leadership/Pages/governor.aspx) has apparently been on [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s mind quite a bit lately. At an [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) event last week, for example, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) told reporters unprompted that he doesn’t believe the [Maryland](https://www.maryland.gov/) [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) is “[presidential timber](https://www.wsj.com/politics/trump-baltimore-wes-moore-crime-f8973d14?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAisEZReJf_3a9-OQP5FevVDRI2PnQ3BQVHA6YBvW_PE8TX3FMtDOsRL_-d5S_0%3D&gaa_ts=68adc264&gaa_sig=aOc_l4RfGfdhkfNARMTJlP5zjRX3RxYP3Z5YHDLb-5rOo4hX9uuZI596Es5_vSDqkCVH7MAWDvijIpHByygRrQ%3D%3D).”

A few days later, the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) responded to criticisms from [Moore](https://governor.maryland.gov/leadership/Pages/governor.aspx) by [threatening to reassess federal aid](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-floats-radical-new-threats-say-doesnt-want-hear-rcna226936) to a [Maryland](https://www.maryland.gov/) infrastructure project, before [questioning](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115084162750679122) the [governor](https://governor.maryland.gov/)’s military service. [Moore](https://governor.maryland.gov/leadership/Pages/governor.aspx) is a decorated combat veteran who served in [Afghanistan](https://moi.gov.af/).)

As this week got underway, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) once again brought up [Moore](https://governor.maryland.gov/leadership/Pages/governor.aspx) at another White House event to share an odd story.

“I met him at the [Army](https://www.westpoint.edu/)-[Navy](https://www.usna.edu/) game,” [Trump claimed](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-executive-order-crime-august-25-2025/). “They said, ‘Oh, there’s [Gov.](https://governor.maryland.gov/) [Moore](https://governor.maryland.gov/leadership/Pages/governor.aspx), he’d love to see you.’ He came over to me, he hugged me, he shook my hand. ... He said, ‘Sir, you’re the greatest [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) in my lifetime.’ I said, ‘It’s really nice that you say that. I’d love you to say it publicly, but I don’t think you can do that.’”

According to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s version of events, [Moore](https://governor.maryland.gov/leadership/Pages/governor.aspx) also told him he’s doing a “fantastic job,” despite his public criticisms.

At face value, the story is literally unbelievable. Why in the world would a progressive [Democratic](htts://www.democrats.org/) [governor](https://governor.maryland.gov/) and fierce [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) critic tell a [Republican](https://governor.maryland.gov/) [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) with an authoritarian agenda how great he is?

[Moore](https://governor.maryland.gov/leadership/Pages/governor.aspx), not surprisingly, [mocked the strange tale](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5469371-maryland-gov-wes-moore-mocks-trump/?tbref=hp). “I’m a person who takes my integrity very seriously, and I spent the past six months before that election campaigning as to why I did not think that he should be the next [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) of the United States,” the [governor](https://governor.maryland.gov/) told [WBAL Radio](https://www.wbal.com/). “So when I say that conversation never happened, that imaginary conversation never happened, I mean that conversation never happened.”

[The Washington Post](https:www.washingtonpost.com/) [reported soon after](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/08/25/trump-wes-moore-disputes/):

> *Video taken at the game by a crew for a [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) documentary series on Faux Nation — that [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) clipped and aired Monday — shows [Moore](https://governor.maryland.gov/leadership/Pages/governor.aspx) welcoming [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) with a handshake and talking to him briefly about rebuilding the collapsed Key Bridge in [Baltimore](https://www.baltimorecity.gov/). In the footage, [Moore](https://governor.maryland.gov/leadership/Pages/governor.aspx) tells [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) that, with federal funding, [Maryland](https://www.maryland.gov/) could reopen the bridge during the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/). ... [Moore](https://governor.maryland.gov/leadership/Pages/governor.aspx)’s spokesman told [The Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) the exchange captured on video was the only time [Moore](https://governor.maryland.gov/leadership/Pages/governor.aspx) and [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) met that day.*

In other words, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) made up the [Moore](https://governor.maryland.gov/leadership/Pages/governor.aspx) conversation, and he presented fiction as fact to the public. In fact, the [Republican](,https://www.gop.com/) has [repeatedly shared the details](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-house-struggles-defend-trumps-unabomber-anecdote-ridicule-rcna219572) of conversations that [only occurred in his overactive imagination](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/the-unsettling-list-trumps-made-conversations-keeps-growing-msna1180326).

And in case that weren’t enough to raise concerns about the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s cognitive abilities, at the same [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) event in which he talked about the chat with [Moore](https://governor.maryland.gov/leadership/Pages/governor.aspx) that didn’t actually happen, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [also said](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-executive-order-crime-august-25-2025/), “They call me the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) of Europe, which is an honor.” (No one calls him “the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) of Europe.”)

He proceeded to falsely claimed to have “stopped seven wars,” before adding, “Really, the number is actually 10,” based on conflicts that he believes he prevented from happening.

This comes a month after [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [expressed surprise](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-says-was-surprised-jerome-powell-fed-chair-appointed-was-appoint-rcna219162) that [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) [Chairman Jerome Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) was appointed, despite the fact that he was the one who appointed [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) in the first place.

Two weeks earlier, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) participated in a press conference at a detention facility in the [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/) Everglades, known as “Alligator Alcatraz,” and a reporter asked the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) whether there was an “expected time frame” that detainees would be kept at the controversial camp.

“I’m gonna spend a lot of — this is my home state,” [the Republican replied](https://newrepublic.com/post/197492/donald-trump-refuses-answer-alligator-alcatraz-florida-cognitive-decline). “I love it. ... I feel very comfortable in the state — I’ll spend a lot of time here.” He [appeared unfazed](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3lsw6f7huq22t) by the disconnect between the question and the answer.

Incidents like these are not uncommon. Indeed, [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) tried to make them a campaign issue ahead of Election Day 2024. In the race’s closing weeks, for example, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [told a 12-minute story about Arnold Palmer’s genitalia](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/bizarre-profane-rhetoric-trump-proves-harris-right-rcna176353), which came just days after the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) decided to stop taking questions at a town-hall event and [instead sway to music](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/lets-just-listen-music-trumps-townhall-event-gets-weird-rcna175449) for 39 minutes.

Now he’s boasting about imaginary conversations and pointing to unnamed sources who’ve labeled him “the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) of Europe.”

As [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/)’s [Rex Huppke summarized](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2025/08/11/trump-dc-crime-national-guard-putin-us/85614586007/) summarized, after [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) twice suggested he was headed to [Russia](http://government.ru/) when he was actually going to [Alaska](https://www.alaska.gov/), “That’s the sort of thing you hear before having to make a difficult decision about grandpa’s future.” Huppke similarly [recently described](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2025/07/28/trump-rant-windmills-epstein-gaza-eu/85409338007/) the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) as being “in obvious mental decline.”
