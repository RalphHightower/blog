*[Ed Martin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edmartinjr/), who leads [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s “weaponization” group at the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/), has said it would “shame” people it can’t prosecute.*

Aug. 18, 2025, 4:06 PM EDT
By [Ja'han Jones](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jahan-jones-ncpn371241)

[Ed Martin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edmartinjr/) is going fishing. On Sunday, the lawyer and [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) loyalist tapped to lead a [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) “weaponization” group [that’s targeting the president’s perceived enemies](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/28/politics/ed-martin-justice-department) vowed to rummage around in the lives of [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) [Attorney General](https://ag.ny.gov/) [Letitia James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james) and [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Adam Schiff (D-CA)](https://www.schiff.senate.gov/), in search of what he says could be potential fraud — or ... something.

During his 2024 campaign, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) repeatedly targeted people who had been investigated or opposed him with thinly [veiled threats of legal prosecution](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/06/trump-retribution-enemy-list-00187725). Now, [Martin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edmartinjr/), in his capacity as head of the so-called [Weaponization Working Group](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/doj-weaponization-group-will-shame-individuals-cant-charge-crimes-new-rcna206553) at the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/), has been tasked with putting those prosecutions into action. The list of targets [includes James](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/donald-trump-letitia-james-subpoenas-rcna224310), who led a successful mortgage fraud case against the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) organization that resulted in a judgment of hundreds of [millions of dollars](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-lawyers-hoping-make-fraud-case-go-away-make-weak-new-pitch-rcna182057); and [Schiff](https://www.schiff.senate.gov/), who served on the [House Jan. 6 select committee](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jan-6-committee-trump-capitol-attack-history-liz-cheney-rcna186138) that [documented Trum’s role in fomenting insurrection in 2021](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/takeaways-jan-6-hearing-trump-raged-riot-unfolded-unfazed-violence-rcna35552).

Officials at [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) are investigating [both Schiff and James of mortgage fraud;](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/doj-opens-investigation-new-york-ags-office-brought-fraud-case-trump-rcna223731) both deny any wrongdoing and accuse the administration of political retribution. [Martin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edmartinjr/), [a former “Stop the Steal” organizer and attorney for Jan. 6 insurrectionists](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/ed-martin-advocate-jan-6-defendants-interim-chief-us-attorney-dc-rcna188446), has been assigned to oversee the cases. He’s previously [said](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/doj-weaponization-group-will-shame-individuals-cant-charge-crimes-new-rcna206553) his group would be used to “shame” people it can’t charge with crimes.

In comments to [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) this Sunday, [Martin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edmartinjr/) suggested his group intends to use its powers to poke around in other parts of [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james)’ and [Schiff](https://www.schiff.senate.gov/)’s lives in search of things unrelated to the mortgage allegations.

He said, “We’re gonna go to the very bottom of the facts, and if somebody did something wrong, we’re not only gonna hold them accountable, we’re also gonna look at everything else that they’ve been doing. Because when you’re a liar, you lie not just on one thing. When you’re a cheater, you cheat not just on one thing. When you’re doing corruption, you generally don’t just do it on one thing.”

As MSNBC legal analyst Kristy Greenberg noted, [Martin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edmartinjr/) seemed to be claiming carte blanche to pry into his target’s lives based on mere suspicion and a presumption that these people must be up to something.

[Martin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edmartinjr/) personally [showed up outside a property James owns in Brooklyn on Friday](https://nypost.com/2025/08/15/us-news/special-attorney-ed-martin-checks-out-tish-james-mortgage-fraud-home/), telling a neighbor he was just “looking at houses,” according to the New York Post.

[Martin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edmartinjr/) seems eager to follow the tradition of former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, who notoriously [used his powers to stalk and harass civil rights figures like Martin Luther King Jr](https://www.npr.org/2021/01/18/956741992/documentary-exposes-how-the-fbi-tried-to-destroy-mlk-with-wiretaps-blackmail). Or perhaps he’s hoping to take a page out of the [playbook](https://www.politico.eu/article/viktor-orban-vows-crackdown-shadow-army-political-opponents/) of [Russian](http://government.ru/) [President Vladimir Putin](http://kremlin.ru/) and other [dictators Trump admires](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-keeps-adding-long-list-highly-respected-dictators-rcna225581), who haven’t [hesitated](https://freedomhouse.org/article/lukashenkas-revenge-political-imprisonment-belarus) to put their [political opponents](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgly78j5ny8o) in prison or conjure up [“kompromat” that can be used against them](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/01/12/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-russian-art-of-kompromat/).
