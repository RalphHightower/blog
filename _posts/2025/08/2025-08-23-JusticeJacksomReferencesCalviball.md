## [Ketanji Brown Jackson accuses the Supreme Court of playing ‘Calvinball’ for Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/ketanji-brown-jackson-supreme-court-trump-calvinball-rcna226523)

*The [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) appointee is alone again in calling out her high court colleagues.*

By [Jordan Rubin](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jordan-rubin-ncpn1301611)

The newspaper comic strip [“Calvin and Hobbes”](https://ralphhightower.github.io/RalphHightower/RalphHightower/Comics/CalvinAndHobbes) had a fictional game [called “Calvinball,”](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/18/opinion/covid-sports.html) the rules of which are made up and constantly changing. The only [fixed rule](https://calvinandhobbes.fandom.com/wiki/Calvinball) is that you can’t play it the same way twice.

The game appeared in a [Supreme Court](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-mississippi-social-media-law-children-netchoice-rcna222198) opinion Thursday, when [Justice](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) [Ketanji Brown Jackson](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/justice-jackson-dissent-supreme-court-error-rcna124903) accused her colleagues of “[Calvinball](https://screenrant.com/calvin-and-hobbes-explained-calvinball/) jurisprudence with a twist.”

In a [solo opinion](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/25a103_kh7p.pdf#page=16) on the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s quest to [cut National Institutes of Health research grants](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/nih-research-grants-supreme-court-trump-rcna222451), she wrote that in the court’s version of [Calvinball](https://screenrant.com/calvin-and-hobbes-explained-calvinball/), “this [Administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) always wins.”

[Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) wrote that in the [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/)’s version of [Calvinball](https://screenrant.com/calvin-and-hobbes-explained-calvinball/), “this [Administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) always wins.”

It’s a remarkable statement from a sitting [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) justice — she was clear to specify “this” [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) — and [not the first time](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-ketanji-brown-jackson-dissent-deadline-newsletter-rcna214180) that she has struck out on her own to publicly address her colleagues in stark terms.

[Jackson](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) is one of three [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) appointees on the court, along with six [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) appointees. This was the latest example of [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) appointees [Sonia Sotomayor](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) and [Elena Kagan](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) declining to sign on to some of [Jackson](https://www.supremecourt.gov/)’s strongest language. (All three [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) appointees joined [Chief Justice John Roberts](https://www.supremecourt.gov/)’ opinion in the [NIH](https://www.nih.gov/) matter, a case that produced a tangle of separate opinions, including [Jackson](https://www.supremecourt.gov/)’s.)

In her solo effort, [Jackson](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) described the [NIH](https://www.nih.gov/) case as the “newest entry in the [Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/)’s quest to make way for the [Executive Branch](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).” She said it’s one that “has real consequences, for the law and for the public,” and she expressed the hope that “affected grant recipients can find a way to maintain their research studies — and their legal claims — long enough to give the [Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) the chance to change its mind.”

If the court changes course in the future and rules against the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/), that would seem to thwart [Jackson](https://www.supremecourt.gov/)’s [Calvinball](https://screenrant.com/calvin-and-hobbes-explained-calvinball/) theory. But presumably she would be happy about that.

> In a broader sense, however, today’s ruling is of a piece with this [Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/)’s recent tendencies.  “[R]ight when the Judiciary should be hunkering down to do all it can to preserve the law’s constraints,” the [Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) opts instead to make vindicating the rule of law and preventing manifestly injurious Government action as difficult as possible. Id., at ___ (JACKSON, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 21).  This is [Calvinball](https://screenrant.com/calvin-and-hobbes-explained-calvinball/) jurisprudence with a twist. [Calvinball](https://screenrant.com/calvin-and-hobbes-explained-calvinball/) has only one rule: There are no fixed rules.<sup>6</sup>  We seem to have two: that one, and this [Administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) always wins.<sup>7</sup>

> <sup>6</sup>See [Oxford English Dictionary (2025)](https://www.oed.com/), [https://www.oed.com/ dictionary/calvinball_n](https://www.oed.com/ dictionary/calvinball_n). 

> <sup>7</sup> JUSTICE BARRETT’s separate opinion proves the point.  It injects final agency action into the case as an additional potential barrier to relief, suggesting that the only challenge the order leaves open—the one to agency guidance—is in fact foreclosed by a doctrine the Government does not press.  See ante, at 5–6; see also ante, at 4, n. 2 (opinion of GORSUCH, J.) (indicating that plaintiffs lack standing to pursue vacatur of the internal agency guidance).
