## [Trump’s family has made $3.4 billion during his time as president, new report finds](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-family-profit-white-house-billions-rcna225627)

*Once upon a time, Americans worried about politicians being bought. Under [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), the most powerful office in the country is now up for sale.*

Aug. 18, 2025, 3:37 PM EDT
By Ali Velshi

This is an adapted excerpt from the [Aug. 17](https://www.msnbc.com/velshi) episode of “Velshi.”

When [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/)’s David Kirkpatrick set out to determine just how much [Donald Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/donald-trump) and his family [profited from his time as president](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZLYWI_DO8), experts told him the exact figures were unknowable. So Kirkpatrick crunched the numbers himself, and the scale he reported is staggering: Since entering the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) in 2017, Kirkpatrick says the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) family has reportedly reaped an astonishing \$3.4 billion.

According to Kirkpatrick’s [new report in The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/08/18/the-number?_sp=faa5ed2a-c173-4aaf-812e-7ede235a163e.1755530173996), the profits stretch across the entire [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) family network. Much of this wealth would have been unimaginable without the presidency. [\$2 billion Saudi investment](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jared-kushners-money-saudi-arabia-comes-sharper-focus-rcna70367) flowed into Jared Kushner’s firm, [Affinity Partners](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jared-kushner-private-equity-firm-affinity-senate-investigation-rcna172758), while [Emirati](https://u.ae/) and [Qatari](https://www.diwan.gov.qa/) investors contributed billions more, as recently as last year. (Kushner has [denied](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68296877) that investments in his company represent a conflict of interest.)

It’s a fundamental rewiring of what public service means.

As Kirkpatrick notes, after doing the math, it’s reasonable to assume that Kushner could personally pocket between half and two-thirds of Affinity’s fees over the next 10 years.

There’s also the [luxury jet](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-qatar-jet-warren-senate-rcna224349) given to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) by the emir of [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/), which [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has said will be donated to his presidential library after he leaves office, and at least five separate [crypto ventures](https://www.msnbc.com/ana-cabrera-reports/watch/trump-family-has-made-over-4b-in-crypto-since-election-day-244983877646) marketed with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s name and political brand. But that’s just scratching the surface.

Start with [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/). Once a \$100,000 club, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) began sharply raising the initiation fee after the 2016 election. Kirkpatrick notes that, as of last fall, it was set to increase to a whopping [\$1 million](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/05/trump-mar-a-lago-membership-price-hike). Kirkpatrick estimates [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) alone generated at least \$125 million in additional profits directly tied to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s political rise.

Then there’s [Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-merchandise-store-business-operations-rcna183706). He’s the first presidential candidate to run a private online store funneling supporters’ money straight into his pocket. Kirkpatrick reported that nearly $28 million has flowed in from MAGA hats, sneakers, picture books and even that infamous “God Bless the USA” Bible.

Don’t forget all those [legal bills](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/watch/-the-big-rip-off-new-reporting-details-donald-trump-campaign-donations-paying-his-legal-bills-203351109709). Under U.S. law, campaign funds can’t cover a candidate’s [personal expenses](https://www.fec.gov/updates/tip2023-personal-use-of-campaign-funds-is-prohibited/) — but political action committees can. According to Kirkpatrick, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) found a loophole by using PACs as his own personal piggy bank for funding his lawyers. By Kirkpatrick’s estimate, more than \$100 million in supporter contributions have gone to defending [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) against lawsuits and criminal charges.

When you add up the money from [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/), merch and money spent for legal fees by PACs, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has reportedly raked in about \$253 million — and that’s before you count the foreign money. From Kushner’s money from the [Saudis](https://my.gov.sa/), to steady business from [gulf monarchies](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-franchise-expanding-middle-east-are-ethical-concerns-rcna206777) and foreign governments such as [Vietnam,](https://www.forbes.com/sites/yessarrosendar/2025/05/22/trump-organization-enters-vietnam-with-15-billion-golf-resort-project-near-hanoi/), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s businesses have become influence pipelines for despots and states eager to win him over.

“The claims that this [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has profited from his time in office are absolutely absurd,” [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/08/18/the-number?_sp=faa5ed2a-c173-4aaf-812e-7ede235a163e.1755530173996). Leavitt said [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) had actually sacrificed “hundreds of millions of dollars” by choosing to serve as [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and not work on his businesses full time.

It’s a fundamental rewiring of what public service means. Once upon a time, Americans worried about politicians being bought. Under [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), the most powerful office in the country is up for sale.

But it doesn’t stop at self-enrichment. As [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/economy/the-u-s-marches-toward-state-capitalism-with-american-characteristics-f75cafa8?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAgnHx1OnqQPpX9GI9edVfMW7uUwKhQwenZ5mqliaRH14SHk2DYBOwxsLl9X3nI%3D&gaa_ts=68a35155&gaa_sig=X8Ec2AN-rZ1xKN3w816YwfZWS2gnbaLlprqSvR9Yf_DxoQV7i03dc7JGTCTOB43pVw_czlAqHQ3CwBp4GLnV6A%3D%3D), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is reshaping the U.S. economy into something that looks like “state capitalism with American characteristics.” Like in [China](https://www.gov.cn/), it’s a system where the state — or in this case, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) — rewards friends and punishes enemies.

The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has steered billion-dollar deals, pushed out CEOs and, as the Journal points out, extracted \$1.5 trillion in investment pledges from [Japan](https://www.japan.go.jp/), the [European Union](https://european-union.europa.eu/) and [South Korea](https://www.gov.kr/), which he claims he will personally direct, though no legal mechanism for doing so appears to exist.
