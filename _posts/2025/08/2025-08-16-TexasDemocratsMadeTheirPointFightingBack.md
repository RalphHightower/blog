## [Texas Democrats are coming home — after using Trump's playbook against him](https://www.msnbc.com/news/news-analysis/texas-democrats-gerrymandering-walkout-trump-rcna224973)

*The party has too often failed to understand the importance of spectacle in today's politics.*

By Eugene Daniels

Sometimes you can't win. But it's better to go down fighting.

For weeks, [Texas Democrats have been doing everything in their power](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/texas-democrats-leave-state-hope-derail-republicans-radical-redistrict-rcna222836) to draw national attention to a radical [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) plan to try to hang on to the [House of Representatives](https://www.house.gov/) in next year's midterms by gerrymandering the state's [already heavily skewed maps](https://gerrymander.princeton.edu/redistricting-report-card/?planId=recL5EF85h0ILukMA).

They started by [giving floor speeches](https://www.msnbc.com/the-weekend-primetime/watch/-ready-to-fight-tx-dem-lawmakers-persist-with-their-weeklong-quorum-244660293920), holding press conferences and meeting with [Democratic governors](https://democraticgovernors.org/) of other states and national [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) leadership. Then, dozens of [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) lawmakers took the [dramatic step of fleeing Texas](https://www.msnbc.com/the-weekend/watch/tx-dems-hold-the-line-against-redistricting-retaliation-this-is-for-the-heart-and-soul-of-america-244670533548) to prevent the Legislature from legally convening.

[Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) are signaling that they might return to [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) now that the first special session is ending and [California lawmakers have introduced their own redistricting plan](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/california-redistricting-gavin-newsom-special-election-texas-rcna225123) to try to offset any new safe seats in [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/).

It's too soon to tell whether any of this will stop the brazen [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) plan to keep power in the [House](https://www.house.gov/) amid [polls showing GOP lawmakers are massively unpopular](https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/trackers/the-republicans-in-congress-favorability). But it has already succeeded at the real goal, which was to help voters realize what [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) are attempting, understand the stakes and know that [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) are trying to do something to stop it.

> *The spectacle wasn't a tactic; it was the whole point.*

The spectacle wasn't a tactic; it was the whole point. It's a lesson that [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) have been slow to learn since President [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s first term, but one that may finally be breaking through.

[James Talarico](https://www.house.texas.gov/members/50), a new breakout star of the [Democratic Party](https://www.democrats.org/), told me progressives have forgotten that getting attention for the cause helps to change the entire playing field. But you can't do it unless you first grab folks' attention. And if that means borrowing a few tricks from the president, so be it.

"[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is the master of the attention economy," [Talarico](https://www.house.texas.gov/members/50)told me. "He is a prime example of how in this new attention economy, you have to be able to break through. And of course, he does it by being cruel and chaotic and incompetent. But there are ways to do it where you're inspirational or you're saying something true and different."

[Talarico](https://www.house.texas.gov/members/50)added that despite some national media coverage, "regular people" weren't really talking about the redistricting effort in [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/): "But once we did this quorum break, suddenly you saw [Google searches for gerrymandering go through the roof](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=US&q=gerrymandering&hl=en), right? And now everybody is just talking about that."

If you've watched [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) closely over the last decade, you've seen the party struggle to break through, send a message and put up a fight in the new [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-era attention economy. Senior members of the party admit that they are handcuffed by their loyalty to institutions that need to remain standing long after [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is gone. Someone has to be adult in the room, they argue.

But voters have been making it pretty clear they don't see it the same way. Forget [Michelle Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/administration/first-lady-michelle-obama)'s [famous advice](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/07/25/remarks-first-lady-democratic-national-convention#:~:text=That%20is%20what%20Barack%20and,(Applause.)) to "go high." Voters are telling [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) that when the other side goes low, they should be willing to go to the depths of hell to fight back.

[Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) seem to be getting the message, as their own [low approval ratings](https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/trackers/the-democrats-in-congress-favorability) are forcing some self-reflection and a shift in strategy. And that starts with putting up a fight.

[Rep.](https://capitol.texas.gov/MnuHouse.aspx) [Jolanda Jones](https://www.house.texas.gov/members/147), another [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) who has gone viral for being blunt and ready to tussle, told me her goal is stopping the map from going through, period. She often brings up the fact that the [Montgomery bus boycott](https://www.history.com/articles/montgomery-bus-boycott) went on for months and that [Texans](https://www.texas.gov/) should see things through until they are able to stop this "racist redistricting" — but she stills sees the political benefit in [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) fighting back even if they lose.

"Am I proud that we're finally fighting? Absolutely. Do I believe that's why the [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) have lost a lot of [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/), because we don't fight? Absolutely. If [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) doesn't know how to do anything, he knows how to fight. Even if he's fighting for idiotic, hateful, anti-everything stuff, he's fighting," [Jones](https://www.house.texas.gov/members/147) said. "Everybody wants their person in the ring to fight. Who goes to a boxing match and the person they're cheering for, they don't want 'em to fight? So I think it is a paradigm shift for the [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/)."

> *That [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) grit has proved to be catching.*

That [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) grit has proved to be catching. As [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) have rallied around the stand those dozens of state lawmakers have taken, they have decided to fight fire with fire, or at least talk about it that way. Instead of shaking their fingers at [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) for calling a special session to gerrymander, they've threatened their own.

And that's really how spectacles change things. They grab voters' attention, which gives politicians a mandate to go further. That can happen even with politicians who aren't known for taking bold stances, as when [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) [Gov.](https://www.governor.ny.gov/) [Kathy Hochul](https://www.governor.ny.gov/about-governor-hochul) threatened to have the state do its own gerrymandering. And it helps make an idea mainstream. [California](https://www.ca.gov/) [Gov.](https://gov.ca.gov/) [Gavin Newsom](https://www.gov.ca.gov/about/) and [Illinois](http://www.illinois.gov/) [Gov.](https://gov.illinois.gov/) [JB Pritzker](https://gov.illinois.gov/about/the-governor.html), two politicians who are fairly obviously thinking about presidential runs one day, both jumped on the issue.

[Newsom](https://www.gov.ca.gov/about/), who in the past has flirted with a more conciliatory, centrist response to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), has even taken to urging voters to support him going further, as a new poll from [Politico](https://www.politico.com/) shows nearly two-thirds of [Californians](https://www.ca.gov/) want to keep their independent redistricting commission, which would foil his plan. Even if [Newsom](https://www.gov.ca.gov/about/) loses, he'll be able to make the case that he tried.

"\[[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)\] doesn't play by a different set of rules. He doesn't believe in the rules. And as a consequence, we need to disabuse ourselves of the way things have been done. It's not good enough to just hold hands, have a candlelight vigil and talk about the way the world should be. We have got to recognize the cards that have been dealt. And we have to meet fire with fire," Newsom said in his press conference announcing the Election Rigging Response Act.

But the question is, will the spectacle be enough to keep momentum going for [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) through the rest of the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) presidency and really turn the tide for the party? That’s a little less clear.

The party has done this before, getting on an impressive tear only to return to business as usual once things cool back down. The most recent example came during the ["No Kings"](https://www.nokings.org/) protests in June, which unleashed an anger and excitement that briefly spurred the party on and then fizzled out.

[Ammar Moussa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ammar-moussa-629b5a35/), a veteran of the [DNC](https://www.democrats.org/) and both the [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) and [Harris](https://kamalaharris.com/) presidential campaigns, says the party is on the right track, but he worries that it still doesn't come naturally.

"It's about [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) being smart and strategic in terms of driving that message and picking real moments," [Moussa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ammar-moussa-629b5a35/) said. "If you’re manufacturing them, voters can tell. ... People can tell when you’re bullshitting them."

That means finding more ways to keep pressing [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) and "drive the ball forward," he says.

“In this attention economy where you really don't get more than a few seconds of people's time, what are the battles that you're going to pick and how are you going to pick them?" he added.
