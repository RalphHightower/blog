[Donnie](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is not as tough as he wants people to believe. The [‚Äú60 Minutes‚Äù](https://www.cbsnews.com/60-minutes/) interview with  opponent [Kamala Harris](https://kamalaharris.com/) caused him mental anguish[^11].

## [Trump lawyer: Pre-election '60 Minutes‚Äô segment caused president 'mental anguish'](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-lawyer-pre-election-60-minutes-segment-caused-president)[^11]

*The latest legal filing from the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)'s lawyers does fresh harm to the idea that [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is the embodiment of toughness.*

While [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his allies have long tried to present him as tough and the epitome of classical masculinity, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) himself hasn‚Äôt done the myth any favors. On the contrary, the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/), far from demonstrating strength and vigor, has an unnerving habit of whining and routinely throwing ‚ÄúTrumper Tantrums‚Äù.

What‚Äôs more, his lawyer‚Äôs latest legal filing does fresh harm to the idea that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is the embodiment of toughness. [The Associated Press reported](https://apnews.com/article/trump-cbs-news-60-minutes-lawsuit-d43effebb7b3b76c31d38908bd31460e):

> *[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) suffered ‚Äúmental anguish‚Äù[^11] from [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/)‚Äô editing of a [‚Äú60 Minutes‚Äù](https://www.cbsnews.com/60-minutes/) interview with [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) opponent [Kamala Harris](https://kamalaharris.com/) last fall, his lawyers are arguing in court papers.*

**Oh my.**[^51]

[^51]: @RalphHightower: emphasis added.

By now, the [the basic elements of this story are probably familiar](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/s-discouraging-see-executive-producer-60-minutes-resign-rcna202595), but to briefly recap, shortly before the 2024 [presidential](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) election, it‚Äôs customary for the major-party nominees to sit down for [‚Äú60 Minutes‚Äù](https://www.cbsnews.com/60-minutes/) interviews. Last fall, [Harris](https://kamalaharris.com/) agreed, while [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [initially accepted the invitation](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/live-blog/vice-presidential-debate-vance-walz-live-updates-rcna172846/rcrd57883?canonicalCard=true) before backing out soon after.

[Harris](https://kamalaharris.com/)‚Äô interview wasn‚Äôt especially memorable ‚Äî it was, however, [recently nominated for an Emmy](https://bsky.app/profile/maxtani.bsky.social/post/3lo4wycb4wk22) ‚Äî though [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has whined incessantly about it for nearly seven months, claiming that the program deceptively edited the segment. The [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)‚Äôs claims [have already been thoroughly discredited](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-cbs-60-minutes-transcript-fcc-rcna190986), but his hysterics have only gotten worse: The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) last month [accused ‚Äú60 Minutes‚Äù](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/s-discouraging-see-executive-producer-60-minutes-resign-rcna202595) of, among other things, ‚Äúunlawful and illegal behavior.‚Äù

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) added that [CBS](https://www.cbs.com/) should lose its broadcast license and ‚Äúpay a big price,‚Äù while calling on the [Federal Communications Commission](https://www.fcc.gov/) to ‚Äúimpose the maximum fines and punishment.‚Äù

But in case that weren‚Äôt quite enough, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) also has an ongoing civil suit against [CBS](https://www.cbs.com/), in which the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) is asking for \$20 billion in damages (that‚Äôs not a typo), based on the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)‚Äôs conspiratorial beliefs about the news magazine‚Äôs election coverage.

[Paramount Global](https://www.paramount.com/), CBS‚Äôs corporate parent, has asked a court to dismiss the civil case, prompting the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)‚Äôs lawyers to defend the litigation on the merits. It was against this backdrop that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs counsel claimed in a court filing that the [‚Äú60 Minutes‚Äù](https://www.cbsnews.com/60-minutes/) segment in question ‚Äúled to widespread confusion and mental anguish‚Äù among news consumers and [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) personally.

The same filing claimed that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs status as a ‚Äúcontent creator‚Äù was damaged; the public steered clear of his social media platform; and the then-[Republican](https://www.gop.com/) candidate had to ‚Äúredirect significant time, money and effort‚Äù after the episode aired.

Given that there really wasn‚Äôt anything meaningfully wrong with the broadcast, it remains unclear why anyone would take any of Team [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs arguments seriously, or why anyone would believe that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) suffered ‚Äúmental anguish‚Äù that warrants \$20 billion in damages.

That said, [Paramount Global](https://www.paramount.com/) is reportedly trying to settle the case anyway, and critics have expressed fears that the company is prepared to give [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) millions of dollars, not because [‚Äú60 Minutes‚Äù](https://www.cbsnews.com/60-minutes/) did anything untoward, but because [Paramount](https://www.paramount.com/) wants the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) to approve [an unrelated merger deal](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/business/media/cbs-60-minutes-trump-bill-owens.html).

[The Wall Street Journal reported](https://www.wsj.com/business/media/paramount-has-offered-15-million-to-settle-cbs-lawsuit-trump-wants-more-861d857e) this week that [Paramount Global](https://www.paramount.com/) recently offered \$15 million to settle the case, citing people familiar with the situation. The same report, which has not been independently verified by [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) or [NBC News](https://www.msnbc.com/), added that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)‚Äôs lawyers want more than \$25 million and an apology from [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/), which, again, didn‚Äôt actually do anything wrong outside of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs overactive imagination.

This ongoing debacle has already cost the network ‚Äî in the last month, the head of [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/) and the executive producer of [‚Äú60 Minutes‚Äù](https://www.cbsnews.com/60-minutes/) [have both stepped down](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/tensions-trumps-bizarre-lawsuit-cbs-news-chief-steps-rcna207766) ‚Äî and we‚Äôll learn soon enough if the tally gets even worse.
