## [As Trump’s Qatari jet deal goes nuclear, Warren and Senate Democrats push for probe](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-qatar-jet-warren-senate-rcna224349)

*Lawmakers and activists want answers on the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s plans to retrofit a ritzy jet gifted to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) with funds from the [U.S. nuclear program](https://www.afgsc.af.mil/Sentinel-GBSD/).*

Aug. 11, 2025, 2:40 PM EDT
By [Ja'han Jones](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jahan-jones-ncpn371241)

A group of [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [lawmakers](https://www.congress.gov/) is pressing [Secretary of the](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Biographies/Display/Article/108402/dr-troy-e-meink/) [Air Force](https://www.af.mil/) [Troy Meink](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Biographies/Display/Article/108402/dr-troy-e-meink/) for details on the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s plan to pull funds from an [Air Force](https://www.af.mil/) [nuclear modernization program](https://www.afgsc.af.mil/Sentinel-GBSD/) to retrofit a luxury jet the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) was given by the [Qatari government](https://hukoomi.gov.qa).

[Sens.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)](https://www.warren.senate.gov/) and [Ed Markey (D-MA)](https://www.markey.senate.gov/), [Tammy Duckworth (D-IL)](https://www.duckworth.senate.gov/), [Adam Schiff (D-CA)](https://www.schiff.senate.gov/), and [Reps.](https://www.house.gov/) [Jamie Raskin (D-MD8)](https://raskin.house.gov/) and [John Garamendi (D-CA8)](https://garamendi.house.gov/) want answers on the [pay for this presidential vanity project with up to \$934 million](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/27/us/politics/air-force-one-trump-cost.html) from the [the wildly over-budgeted “Sentinel” program](https://apnews.com/article/nuclear-sentinel-weapon-icbm-cost-39c69242301b2a273111d161573f5c56), which is meant to upgrade the [military’s nuclear arsenal](https://www.afgsc.af.mil/Sentinel-GBSD/).

A prime example of the U.S.’ [excessive military spending,](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pentagon-budget-price-gouging-military-contractors-60-minutes-2023-05-21/), the program has faced bipartisan criticism for its overspending and its failure to meet deadlines. But rather than slash the program (like, say, [funding for cutting-edge mRNA research](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-cuts-500-million-mrna-vaccine-contracts-dealing-major-blow-prom-rcna223281) and other things the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has deemed wasteful), the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) plans to pull \$400 million from it to retrofit [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s palatial new airplane, [Meink said last month](https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2025/06/air-force-using-sentinel-money-retrofit-qatar-jet/406384/) at a [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) subcommittee hearing. [Meink](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Biographies/Display/Article/108402/dr-troy-e-meink/) also testified that using that earmarked money will not affect or delay the updates to the [Sentinel](https://www.afgsc.af.mil/Sentinel-GBSD/) program.

As one might imagine, the aforementioned [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) are raising issues in [a letter](https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letter_to_air_force_secretary_meink_re_qatari_jet_retrofit_funds_transfer.pdf) addressed to [Meink](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Biographies/Display/Article/108402/dr-troy-e-meink/) last Wednesday:

> *We write with concerns about how the [Air Force](https://www.af.mil/) is managing [nuclear modernization funds](https://www.afgsc.af.mil/Sentinel-GBSD/), including whether those funds are being raided to retrofit a personal gift to [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) that likely violates the [emoluments clause](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S9-C8-3/ALDE_00013206/%5B'Emoluments'%5D) of the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/).*

After noting that even staunch conservatives like [Sens.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Mitch McConnell T-KY](https://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/) and [Deb Fischer (T-NE)](https://www.fischer.senate.gov/) have previously raised concerns about the program being used as a slush fund for the [executive branch](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s [pet projects](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), the lawmakers make the seemingly obvious point that souping up a jet for the use of the sitting [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) , who intends to pass it along to his official library at the end of his term, meets that description:

> *Now, our concerns, and those of other members, appear to be prescient as part of the [Sentinel](https://www.afgsc.af.mil/Sentinel-GBSD/) program’s bloated budget is being redirected to an unintended purpose: retrofitting the [Qatari](https://hukoomi.gov.qa) luxury jet to serve as [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/) — and subsequently, after he has left office, as the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [library](http://www.trumplibrary.gov/)’s private plane.*

They go on:

> *It appears that funds for programs that the [Air Force](https://www.af.mil/) has continually claimed are among its top national security priorities are now being used as accounts for [presidential whims](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), while the egregious lack of transparency hides the true costs of these programs from taxpayers.*

The [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) want more specifics on the cost estimates for retrofitting the plane, including whether the [Department of Defense](https://www.defense.gov/) would be on the hook to pay for future modifications.

On Friday, liberal activists from the watchdog group [Democracy Defenders Fund](https://www.democracydefendersfund.org/) [joined the pressure campaign](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/watchdog-group-requests-probe-defense-dept-qatari-plane-air-force-one-trump/), urging the [Defense Department](https://www.defense.gov/)’s [inspector general](https://www.afinspectorgeneral.af.mil/) to open a probe into whether the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has broken any laws by accepting the jet (technically [given to the Department of Defense](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/27/politics/qatar-air-force-one-gift-agreement)). The [Defense Department](https://www.defense.gov/) [inspector general](https://www.afinspectorgeneral.af.mil/) [declined to comment](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/watchdog-group-requests-probe-defense-dept-qatari-plane-air-force-one-trump/) to [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/).

And who can fault them? This jet fiasco is outrageous and appears to be the most blatant abuse of office by a [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) in recent memory. That the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) would pull funds from a purportedly [essential nuclear program](https://www.afgsc.af.mil/Sentinel-GBSD/) to pay for it reeks of self-enrichment and underscores ongoing concerns that the U.S. under [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is continuing its [descent into tin-pot dictator territory](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/31/trump-brazil-democracy).
