title: "Trump Crime Family: Air Force Raiding Nuclear Missiles Modernization to Fortify Trump’s Qatari Bribe, Boeing 747-8 Jumbo Jet"
---


[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) accepted \$400 million dollar bribe from the [Qatari royal family](https;//hukoomi.gov.qa/) in the form of a luxury [Boeing](https://www.boeing.com/) [747-8](https://www.boeing.com/commercial/747-8)  jumbo jet. It's gonna cost at least \$1 billion dollars and one to two years to strip the jet to its airframe to ensure there are no listening devices, install secure communications and avionics, missile defense systems, and harden the plane to survive nuclear electromagnetic pulse. The [Air Force](https://www.af.mil/) is raiding money allocated to upgrade the nuclear missile silos for the [Sentinel Missile Upgrade](https://www.afgsc.af.mil/Sentinel-GBSD/) to bring the [Qatari](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) jet to bring it to [Air Force](https://www.af.mil/) One standards to make it a flying fortress. That money for missile upgrades will have to be replaced. As I understand it, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) will get to keep the jet once his term has ended. [Chris Murphy (D-CT)](https://www.murphy.senate.gov/) tried to insert an amendment to the Defense Appropriations legislation for the government to use the jet for its lifespan, but his amendment was shot down; so [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) gets to take the jet with him when his term expires. Meanwhile, the existing Air Force One and Two will need to be replaced; that cost is \$6.2 billion so far. That brings the grand total to \8.2 billion so [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) gets a free jet from the government. 

That's madness! That's fucking insane!

| Budget Item | Projected Cost |
|---|---:|
| [Qatari 747-8 Air Force One Upgrade](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) | \$1,000,000,000 |
| [Sentinel Program](https://www.afgsc.af.mil/Sentinel-GBSD/) (at least) | \$1,000,000,000 |
| Air Force One and Two (6.2b and climbing) | \$6,200,000,000 |
| **Total** | \$8,200,000,000 |


## [As Trump’s Qatari jet deal goes nuclear, Warren and Senate Democrats push for probe](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-qatar-jet-warren-senate-rcna224349)

*Lawmakers and activists want answers on the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s plans to retrofit a ritzy jet gifted to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) with funds from the [U.S. nuclear program](https://www.afgsc.af.mil/Sentinel-GBSD/).*

Aug. 11, 2025, 2:40 PM EDT
By [Ja'han Jones](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jahan-jones-ncpn371241)

A group of [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [lawmakers](https://www.congress.gov/) is pressing [Secretary of the](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Biographies/Display/Article/108402/dr-troy-e-meink/) [Air Force](https://www.af.mil/) [Troy Meink](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Biographies/Display/Article/108402/dr-troy-e-meink/) for details on the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s plan to pull funds from an [Air Force](https://www.af.mil/) [nuclear modernization program](https://www.afgsc.af.mil/Sentinel-GBSD/) to retrofit a luxury jet the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) was given by the [Qatari government](https://hukoomi.gov.qa).

[Sens.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)](https://www.warren.senate.gov/) and [Ed Markey (D-MA)](https://www.markey.senate.gov/), [Tammy Duckworth (D-IL)](https://www.duckworth.senate.gov/), [Adam Schiff (D-CA)](https://www.schiff.senate.gov/), and [Reps.](https://www.house.gov/) [Jamie Raskin (D-MD8)](https://raskin.house.gov/) and [John Garamendi (D-CA8)](https://garamendi.house.gov/) want answers on the [pay for this presidential vanity project with up to \$934 million](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/27/us/politics/air-force-one-trump-cost.html) from the [the wildly over-budgeted “Sentinel” program](https://apnews.com/article/nuclear-sentinel-weapon-icbm-cost-39c69242301b2a273111d161573f5c56), which is meant to upgrade the [military’s nuclear arsenal](https://www.afgsc.af.mil/Sentinel-GBSD/).

A prime example of the U.S.’ [excessive military spending,](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pentagon-budget-price-gouging-military-contractors-60-minutes-2023-05-21/), the program has faced bipartisan criticism for its overspending and its failure to meet deadlines. But rather than slash the program (like, say, [funding for cutting-edge mRNA research](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-cuts-500-million-mrna-vaccine-contracts-dealing-major-blow-prom-rcna223281) and other things the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has deemed wasteful), the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) plans to pull \$400 million from it to retrofit [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s palatial new airplane, [Meink said last month](https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2025/06/air-force-using-sentinel-money-retrofit-qatar-jet/406384/) at a [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) subcommittee hearing. [Meink](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Biographies/Display/Article/108402/dr-troy-e-meink/) also testified that using that earmarked money will not affect or delay the updates to the [Sentinel](https://www.afgsc.af.mil/Sentinel-GBSD/) program.

As one might imagine, the aforementioned [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) are raising issues in [a letter](https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letter_to_air_force_secretary_meink_re_qatari_jet_retrofit_funds_transfer.pdf) addressed to [Meink](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Biographies/Display/Article/108402/dr-troy-e-meink/) last Wednesday:

> *We write with concerns about how the [Air Force](https://www.af.mil/) is managing [nuclear modernization funds](https://www.afgsc.af.mil/Sentinel-GBSD/), including whether those funds are being raided to retrofit a personal gift to [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) that likely violates the [emoluments clause](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S9-C8-3/ALDE_00013206/%5B'Emoluments'%5D) of the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/).*

After noting that even staunch conservatives like [Sens.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Mitch McConnell T-KY](https://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/) and [Deb Fischer (T-NE)](https://www.fischer.senate.gov/) have previously raised concerns about the program being used as a slush fund for the [executive branch](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s [pet projects](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), the lawmakers make the seemingly obvious point that souping up a jet for the use of the sitting [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) , who intends to pass it along to his official library at the end of his term, meets that description:

> *Now, our concerns, and those of other members, appear to be prescient as part of the [Sentinel](https://www.afgsc.af.mil/Sentinel-GBSD/) program’s bloated budget is being redirected to an unintended purpose: retrofitting the [Qatari](https://hukoomi.gov.qa) luxury jet to serve as [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/) — and subsequently, after he has left office, as the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [library](http://www.trumplibrary.gov/)’s private plane.*

They go on:

> *It appears that funds for programs that the [Air Force](https://www.af.mil/) has continually claimed are among its top national security priorities are now being used as accounts for [presidential whims](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), while the egregious lack of transparency hides the true costs of these programs from taxpayers.*

The [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) want more specifics on the cost estimates for retrofitting the plane, including whether the [Department of Defense](https://www.defense.gov/) would be on the hook to pay for future modifications.

On Friday, liberal activists from the watchdog group [Democracy Defenders Fund](https://www.democracydefendersfund.org/) [joined the pressure campaign](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/watchdog-group-requests-probe-defense-dept-qatari-plane-air-force-one-trump/), urging the [Defense Department](https://www.defense.gov/)’s [inspector general](https://www.afinspectorgeneral.af.mil/) to open a probe into whether the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has broken any laws by accepting the jet (technically [given to the Department of Defense](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/27/politics/qatar-air-force-one-gift-agreement)). The [Defense Department](https://www.defense.gov/) [inspector general](https://www.afinspectorgeneral.af.mil/) [declined to comment](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/watchdog-group-requests-probe-defense-dept-qatari-plane-air-force-one-trump/) to [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/).

And who can fault them? This jet fiasco is outrageous and appears to be the most blatant abuse of office by a [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) in recent memory. That the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) would pull funds from a purportedly [essential nuclear program](https://www.afgsc.af.mil/Sentinel-GBSD/) to pay for it reeks of self-enrichment and underscores ongoing concerns that the U.S. under [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is continuing its [descent into tin-pot dictator territory](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/31/trump-brazil-democracy).

### [Duckworth Joins Warren, Colleagues in Demanding Details from Air Force on Qatari Jet Funding / U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois](https://www.duckworth.senate.gov/news/press-releases/duckworth-joins-warren-colleagues-in-demanding-details-from-air-force-on-qatari-jet-funding)

[WASHINGTON, D.C.]. August 7, 2025. – [U.S. Senator](https://www.senate.gov/) [Tammy Duckworth (D-IL)](https://www.duckworth.senate.gov/) today joined [U.S. Senators](https://www.senate.gov/) [Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)](https://www.warren.senate.gov/), [Ed Markey (D-MA)](https://www.markey.senate.gov/) and [Adam Schiff (D-CA)](https://www.schiff.senate.gov/) in calling on [Air Force](https://www.af.mil/) [Secretary Troy Meink](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Biographies/Display/Article/108402/dr-troy-e-meink/) to provide details on using funding from the [Sentinel](https://www.afgsc.af.mil/Sentinel-GBSD/) nuclear program to pay for retrofits for the luxury jet [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) is giving [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).

“We write with concerns about how the [Air Force](https://www.af.mil/) is managing nuclear modernization funds, including whether those funds are being raided to retrofit a personal gift to [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) that likely violates the [emoluments clause](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S1-C7-1/ALDE_00000233/) of the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/),” wrote the Senators. “[B]y providing the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) with a ‘palace in the sky’ it clearly appears that [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) is trying to curry favor with the [Administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)…Now, our concerns, and those of other members, appear to be prescient as part of the [Sentinel](https://www.afgsc.af.mil/Sentinel-GBSD/) program’s bloated budget is being redirected to an unintended purpose: retrofitting the [Qatari](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) luxury jet to serve as [Air Force](https://www.af.mil/) One — and subsequently, after he has left office, as the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) library’s private plane.”

On May 11, the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [Administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) announced it was planning to accept a \$400 million luxury [Boeing](https://www.boeing.com/) [747-8](https://www.boeing.com/commercial/747-8) jumbo jet from the [Qatari royal family](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/). This deal gave [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) a jet that would 1) likely require taxpayers to pay at least $1 billion to retrofit it for the safe transportation of the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and 2) only be used by the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) for a few years before it would be donated to [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s >presidential library].

[Secretary Meink](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Biographies/Display/Article/108402/dr-troy-e-meink/) testified that this plane needs “significant modifications” to meet [Air Force](https://www.af.mil/) One standards, with reports showing that the funds to make those repairs may be coming from the [Sentinel](https://www.afgsc.af.mil/Sentinel-GBSD/) nuclear missile program – a program that is already set to be delayed several years and costs 81 percent more than initial estimates. Still, the [Air Force](https://www.af.mil/) has claimed to [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) that the program is a top priority.

“While it is critical to keep the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and his communications safe from any future adversaries, we have serious concerns that this unconstitutional payoff is now wasting taxpayer dollars,” continued the Senators. “It appears that funds for programs that the [Air Force](https://www.af.mil/) has continually claimed are among its top national security priorities are now being used as accounts for [presidential whims](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), while the egregious lack of transparency hides the true costs of these programs from taxpayers.”

To provide [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) more clarity on these [Air Force](https://www.af.mil/) priorities, the members are requesting answers from [Secretary Meink](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Biographies/Display/Article/108402/dr-troy-e-meink/) by August 20, 2025.

Full text of the letter can be found below and on [Senator Duckworth’s website](https://www.duckworth.senate.gov/download/warren-letter-to-air-force-secretary-meink-re-qatari-jet-funds):

Dear [Secretary Meink](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Biographies/Display/Article/108402/dr-troy-e-meink/):

We write with concerns about how the [Air Force](https://www.af.mil/) is managing nuclear modernization funds, including whether those funds are being raided to retrofit a personal gift to [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) that likely violates the [emoluments clause](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S1-C7-1/ALDE_00000233/) of the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/).

On May 11, the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) announced it was planning to accept a \$400 million luxury [Boeing](https://www.boeing.com/) [747-8](https://www.boeing.com/commercial/747-8) jumbo jet from the [Qatari royal family](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/). As we previously wrote, accepting this gift likely violated the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/)’s prohibition on accepting [foreign emoluments](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S1-C7-1/ALDE_00000233/) and was likely to require taxpayers to pay at least \$1 billion to retrofit the jet to be able to safely transport the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). Even more concerning, the jet would only be used by the U.S. government for a few years at most and then would be donated to [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [presidential library](http://www.trumplibrary.gov/). Press reports indicate that [Secretary of](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) [Defense](https://www.defense.gov/) [Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) has signed a memorandum of understanding stating that the jet is an “unconditional donation” and a “bona fide gift,” and that the exchange does not involve “an offer, promise, or acceptance of any form of bribery, undue influence, or corrupt practice.” However, by providing the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) with a “palace in the sky” it clearly appears that [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) is trying to curry favor with the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/).

As you testified to the [Senate Armed Services Committee](http://www.armed-services.senate.gov/), this plane needs “significant modifications” to meet [Air Force One standards](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/). Those likely include “defenses against a range of threats, from surface-to-air missiles to a nuclear blast,” secure and reliable communications systems and protections against counterintelligence.

We were concerned by reports that the funds to retrofit the [Qatari](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) jet are coming from the “massively-over-budget, behind-schedule” [Sentinel nuclear missile program](https://www.afgsc.af.mil/Sentinel-GBSD/). According to this report, the [Air Force](https://www.af.mil/) assessed that \$934 million previously appropriated for the [Sentinel](https://www.afgsc.af.mil/Sentinel-GBSD/) program was actually in “excess to need” and could be used instead to pay for other classified programs, including the retrofits for the [Qatari](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) jet. Already, the [Sentinel](https://www.afgsc.af.mil/Sentinel-GBSD/) program is set to be delayed several years and costs 81 percent more than initial estimates. The [Government Accountability Office](https://www.gao.gov/) has cautioned that the program “costs could swell further” and that “developing a reliable schedule” is critical for understanding the program’s full price tag.

There has been bipartisan concern about the mismanagement of the [Sentinel program](https://www.afgsc.af.mil/Sentinel-GBSD/). [Senator](https://www.senate.gov/) [Fischer](https://www.fischer.senate.gov/) raised concerns that the [Air Force](https://www.af.mil/) was positioning itself to be able to “raid [Sentinel](https://www.afgsc.af.mil/Sentinel-GBSD/) budget lines to pay for other programs,” and [Senator](https://www.senate.gov/) [McConnell](https://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/) similarly raised concerns that putting funding for the [Sentinel program](https://www.afgsc.af.mil/Sentinel-GBSD/) in both the reconciliation bill and annual appropriations bills would “function like a shell game.” Now, our concerns, and those of other members, appear to be prescient as part of the [Sentinel program’s bloated budget](https://www.afgsc.af.mil/Sentinel-GBSD/) is being redirected to an unintended purpose: retrofitting the [Qatari luxury jet](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) to serve as [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/) — and subsequently, after he has left office, as the [Trump library’s private plane](https://www.trumplibrary.gov/).

We are also concerned that, because the total price tag is classified, policymakers cannot discuss and the public still does not know whether additional retrofit costs will eat into other [Air Force](https://www.af.mil/) programs beyond [Sentinel](https://www.afgsc.af.mil/Sentinel-GBSD/). Senior U.S. officials are currently reviewing floor plans and schematics for the [Qatari jet](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/), and the [Air Force](https://www.af.mil/) should provide [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) with the information it needs to ensure that taxpayer funds are not being wasted and that the [Qatari](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) jet retrofit is not endangering funds needed for other critical national security priorities. The [Air Force](https://www.af.mil/) has yet to provide the necessary information.

While it is critical to keep the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and his communications safe from any future adversaries, we have serious concerns that this unconstitutional payoff is now wasting taxpayer dollars. It appears that funds for programs that the [Air Force](https://www.af.mil/) has continually claimed are among its top national security priorities are now being used as accounts for [presidential whims](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), while the egregious lack of transparency hides the true costs of these programs from taxpayers.

To provide [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) more clarity on these [Air Force](https://www.af.mil/) priorities, we request answers to the following questions by August 20, 2025:

1. Has the [Air Force](https://www.af.mil/) assessed whether shifting funds out of the [Sentinel](https://www.afgsc.af.mil/Sentinel-GBSD/) program will increase the program’s costs or risk further delaying the program’s schedule?
2. Did or will any of the \$934 million from the [Sentinel program](https://www.afgsc.af.mil/Sentinel-GBSD/) go to retrofits for the [Qatari](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) [Boeing](https://www.boeing.com/) [747-8](https://www.boeing.com/commercial/747-8), or were or will those funds be diverted to other programs?
3. In June, you told [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) that the cost of retrofitting the [Qatari](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) [Boeing](https://www.boeing.com/) [747-8](https://www.boeing.com/commercial/747-8) “wouldn’t be anywhere near” the reported \$1 billion estimate. Do you still believe this to be the case?
4. How does including [Sentinel](https://www.afgsc.af.mil/Sentinel-GBSD/) funding in the reconciliation bill impact the [Sentinel](https://www.afgsc.af.mil/Sentinel-GBSD/) program’s cost and schedule estimates?
5. Does the [Air Force](https://www.af.mil/) have an independent cost estimate for the costs of retrofitting the [Qatari](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) [Boeing](https://www.boeing.com/) [747-8](https://www.boeing.com/commercial/747-8)? If so, please provide us with this information.
6. Will future retrofit costs for the [Qatari](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) [Boeing](https://www.boeing.com/) [747-8](https://www.boeing.com/commercial/747-8) come out of the [Sentinel](https://www.afgsc.af.mil/Sentinel-GBSD/) program? If not, what accounts will they be drawn from?
7. Does the [Air Force](https://www.af.mil/) plan to outsource the retrofitting of the [Qatari](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) [Boeing](https://www.boeing.com/) [747-8](https://www.boeing.com/commercial/747-8) to a defense contractor? If so, will that contract be competitively bid?
8. Will the [Air Force](https://www.af.mil/) delay the deployment of the [Qatari](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) [Boeing](https://www.boeing.com/) [747-8](https://www.boeing.com/commercial/747-8) if it needs more time to ensure that all the sufficient security measures for the aircraft are in place?
9. If the retrofitting is more than 15 percent behind schedule or 15 percent over the initial cost estimate the [Air Force](https://www.af.mil/) gave it, will the program be reviewed for cancellation in accordance with [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s April 9 executive order?
10. Will the [Air Force](https://www.af.mil/) commit to fully cooperating with any independent investigation into the acceptance of the [Qatari](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) jet and/or the [Qatari](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) jet’s retrofitting?
11. When will the [Air Force](https://www.af.mil/) have an updated cost estimate for the [Sentinel program](https://www.afgsc.af.mil/Sentinel-GBSD/)?
12. Does the [Air Force](https://www.af.mil/) expect the [Sentinel program’s cost](https://www.afgsc.af.mil/Sentinel-GBSD/) not to rise any further, now that officials say the program was funded in excess to need in 2024?
