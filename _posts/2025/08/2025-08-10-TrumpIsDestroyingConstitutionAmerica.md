*The last remnant of the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/)’s system of checks and balances is the one that remains partly in [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) hands.*

Aug. 9, 2025, 6:00 AM EDT
By [Kevin J. Elliott](https://politicalscience.yale.edu/people/kevin-elliott), political scientist at [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/) and the author of ["Democracy for Busy People"](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/D/bo194847654.html)

How do you prevent tyranny and preserve liberty? The framers of the [U.S. Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/) set themselves this task when they convened nearly 240 years ago. Their solution — creating formally independent branches of government — rested on the assumption that a restless desire for power was an immovable fixture of human nature. By vesting shared powers in the rival branches like the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s veto on legislation and [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/)’ role in approving executive nominees and control over spending, they thought they could force the branches into conflict if any of them sought to impose its will on the others, or the country.

The [abdications](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/trump-republicans-congress-power.html) of the [Republican Congress](https://apnews.com/article/trump-congress-compliant-ceding-power-republicans-4508b5e6f893da17e9064426e6fefc6c) and [conservative](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-nightly/2025/07/01/the-supreme-court-decision-that-unleashed-trump-00434342) [Supreme](https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-trump-mass-firings-151e14da3186d34eab1923c45831c1b6) [Court](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/trump-supreme-court-shadow-docket-emergency-agenda-1235394694/) in the past seven months have thoroughly discredited the framers’ assumption about human nature. Partisanship has proved more powerful than the separation of powers.

> *[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)s this historically unpopular would expect to see dramatic losses in [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) in any free and fair election.*

So, it should not surprise us that the last remnant of the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/)’s system of checks and balances is the one that remains partly in [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) hands: state governments. The independent authority of state governments enshrined in the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/), which enables them to legitimately contest federal power, is what political scientists and legal scholars call federalism. Now it appears that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is seeking to extend his successful subversion of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) and the [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) to overcome federalism as well.

The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s recent demand that [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) and other [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)-controlled states engage in an irregular mid-decade redistricting effort is an unprecedented incursion into state authority. In [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) aims to transmute five [House](https://www.house.gov/) seats held by [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) into five that [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) could win handily in 2026. Given the chamber’s narrow margin, these five seats alone could determine who controls the [House](https://www.house.gov/) after the midterm elections — regardless of who gets more votes.

This is the key to the entire plot. The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s party usually loses seats in midterm elections. The [Democratic](https//www.democrats.org/) lead on the generic ballot is currently small, but likely large enough to overcome [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/)’ razor-thin majority in the [House](https://www.house.gov/). [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is already the most unpopular modern [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) at this point in a new term — other than himself at this time in his first term. In fact, [he is currently more unpopular](https://news.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspx) than he was on the eve of the 2018 midterm election, in which his party lost control of the [House](https://www.house.gov/). [Presidents](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) this historically unpopular would expect to see dramatic losses in [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) in any free and fair election.

But after his loss in the 2020 election and the [insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) seems determined not to allow apparent election losses to again obstruct his power. Though gerrymandering is nearly as old as the United States, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is the first [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) to attempt [a nationwide effort](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/06/us/politics/trump-republicans-states-redistricting.html) to secure his party control of the [House](https://www.house.gov/) by gerrymandering immediately before the election. In the context of the [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) and [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/)’s surrender to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his record of election denial, this is best understood as an effort to secure what can only be characterized as autocratic control over all of American government.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is seeking to shield himself from the will of the voters by having his allies redraw legislative districts. It is a [familiar strategy](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/news-and-updates/what-is-competitive-authoritarianism/) of authoritarian governments that seek to masquerade as robust democracies. They [change the rules](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/562246/how-democracies-die-by-steven-levitsky-and-daniel-ziblatt/) of electoral competition to favor their allies and make it unfairly or impossibly difficult for the opposition to win power.

> *[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is seeking to shield himself from the will of the voters by having his allies redraw legislative districts.*

None of this is lost on the [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) legislators who fled the state to prevent the redistricting plan from going through, or the [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) governors supporting them. [California](https://www.ca.gov/)’s [Gavin Newsom](https://www.gov.ca.gov/about/) has clearly signaled he understands the stakes. In a meeting with some of the [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/), he said, “[Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) called up [Texas] [Gov.](https://gov.texas.gov/) [Abbott](https://gov.texas.gov/governor-abbott) for one simple reason: to rig the 2026 election.” He [characterized](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/07/25/governor-newsom-meets-with-texas-state-leaders-amid-republican-efforts-to-gerrymander-state-to-let-trump-keep-wielding-power-without-restraint/) the redistricting effort as an “undemocratic” effort to keep [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) in power without meaningful congressional oversight.

[New York](https://www.ny.gov/) [Gov.](https://www.governor.ny.gov/) [Kathy Hochul](https://www.governor.ny.gov/about-governor-hochul) said the effort was “nothing less than a legal insurrection” and that “if [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) are willing to rewrite the rules to give themselves an advantage, then they’re leaving us no choice. We must do the same.”

[Illinois](https://www.illinois.gov/) [Gov.](https://gov.illinois.gov/) [JB Pritzker](https://gov.illinois.gov/about/the-governor.html) has probably been the most aggressive of the [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) governors supporting the [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) legislators, [promising not only to house them](https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/08/06/gov-jb-pritzker-colbert-texas-dems/) but also to shield them from potential arrest by federal agents. Though it is unclear how serious that danger is, [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [John Cornyn (T-TX)](https://www.cornyn.senate.gov/), said the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) had agreed to assist in their return and [Trump said the FBI](https://apnews.com/video/trump-says-fbi-may-have-to-help-bring-texas-democrats-back-to-state-988d1f4ba51848b29aca391a3f8285b6) “may have to” go get them.

It thus seems that the [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) gerrymander effort and the resulting flight of the state’s [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) lawmakers may lead to a face-off between a [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/)-controlled state government, or several of them, and federal officials helping to indirectly carry out [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s gerrymandering directive. Moreover, all three governors, as well as state legislators [in Maryland](https://wjla.com/news/local/maryland-congressional-map-redistricting-legislation-texas-republicans-democrats-politics-donald-trump-census-david-moon-house-majority-leader-gop-2026-midterm-election-census-bureau-registered-voters-house-senate), have signaled a willingness to consider unprecedented (and often [technically](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/08/democrats-redistricting-republicans-gerrymandering-texas/683775/) [difficult](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/26/dem-redistricting-00478136) redistricting efforts in their own states to counter [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s push. This is federalism in dramatic form.

These governors are signaling that American federalism will not be overthrown as easily as the [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) and [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/). It is impossible to predict how all this will be resolved, but there is considerable reason to think these states will not abjectly surrender like [congressional](https://www.congress.gov/,) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) or the [Roberts Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/). There’s still a fight to be had here. Thankfully for the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/), these [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) seem willing to have it.
