Across the country, Americans are gearing up for another round of mass demonstrations against [Donald Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/donald-trump) and his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/). Protesters in over 30 states will take to the streets on Saturday for the [“Fight the Trump Takeover”](https://www.fightthetrumptakeover.com/) to push back against the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) redistricting efforts.

The nationwide mobilization effort comes on the heels of a showdown in [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) over electoral maps. [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/,) lawmakers [fled the state](https://www.msnbc.com/ana-cabrera-reports/watch/texas-house-unable-to-reach-quorum-due-to-dem-absences-amid-redistricting-battle-245073989947) after [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) asked [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) to guarantee the party [five more congressional seats](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/texas-redistricting-republicans-trump-reward-rcna223348) ahead of next year’s midterm elections, even though the maps are only supposed to be redrawn every 10 years after the [Census](https://www.census.gov/).

“[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is trying to steal the 2026 election by rigging the system and changing electoral maps,” the [“Fight the Trump Takeover”](https://www.fightthetrumptakeover.com/) website states. “He started in [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/), but he won’t stop there. We are fighting back.”

Saturday’s rallies are backed by a coalition of organizations, including [Move On](https://front.moveon.org/), [Planned Parenthood](https://www.weareplannedparenthoodaction.org/), the [Human Rights Campaign](https://give.hrc.org/) and [Indivisible](https://indivisible.org/).

[Ezra Levin,](https://www.msnbc.com/all-in/watch/-fight-the-trump-takeover-protests-set-to-rock-20-states-this-weekend-245027909669) co-founder and co-executive director of [Indivisible](https://indivisible.org/), spoke to [Antonia Hylton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonia-hylton-380bb887/) on Thursday’s [“All In”](https://www.msnbc.com/all) about the planned protests. “Look, my expectation is that courage is contagious, and we’ve seen a lot of courage out there,” [Levin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ezralevin/) said, referencing [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/)’ decision to leave the state and deny [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) the quorum needed to pass the gerrymandered maps.

“That took guts. That was courage. And the question is, how do you make that contagious? It can't all be on the [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/). We’ve got to do our part. Saturday is the part where we make it contagious.”

[Indivisible](https://indivisible.org/) was also one of the organizations behind the record-breaking [“No Kings” protests.](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/no-kings-protests-trump-military-parade-rcna212922). Organizers estimated more than 5 million people came out for the [June 14 event](https://www.nokings.org/), making it one of the largest single days of protest in United States history.

When [Levin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ezralevin/) was asked if he expected Saturday’s rallies to draw similar numbers, he told Hylton: “In the fight against authoritarianism, not every single protest, not every single action, needs to match the scale or the breadth of the one before it. That’s not how you build a successful opposition to authoritarianism.”

According to [Levin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ezralevin/), the success of an opposition isn't just dependent on the size of the movement, but also the ability of activists to sustain pressure: “What we’ve learned from overseas fights against autocratic rule, historical fights against autocratic rule in the South and elsewhere, is that you gotta keep on building. It is a muscle, and you gotta keep on working it.”
