## [DOJ releases transcripts and audio of Ghislaine Maxwell's meeting with Todd Blanche](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/ghislaine-maxwell-todd-blanche-doj-transcripts-audio-rcna226676)

*The convicted Jeffrey Epstein associate is seeking clemency from [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). She claimed she never saw him do anything “inappropriate.”*

Aug. 22, 2025, 3:47 PM EDT / Updated Aug. 22, 2025, 4:44 PM EDT
By [Jordan Rubin](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jordan-rubin-ncpn1301611)

The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) on Friday released transcripts and audio recordings of convicted Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell’s [unusual interview](https://www.npr.org/2025/07/29/nx-s1-5484129/todd-blanche-epstein-ghislaine-maxwell-trump) last month with [Deputy](https://www.justice.gov/dag/) [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Todd Blanche](https://www.justice.gov/dag/). [Blanche](https://www.justice.gov/dag/), who was previously [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s personal defense lawyer, met with Maxwell amid political backlash over the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s refusal to release all the [information it has related to Epstein](https://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/watch/andrew-weissmann-trump-doj-s-slow-release-of-epstein-files-is-such-a-crazy-way-to-proceed-245549125504).

The release of these transcripts and audio (you can read and listen to them here) doesn’t address the fact that the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) [still has not released](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/jeffrey-epstein-grand-jury-transcripts-unsealed-ruling-rcna224551) all the information it has related to Epstein, who died in 2019 while being held on sex trafficking charges in what the medical examiner called a suicide.

According to the [transcript](https://www.justice.gov/storage/audio-files/Interview%20Transcript/Interview%20Transcript%20-%20Maxwell%202025.07.24%20(Redacted).pdf), Maxwell said she “actually never saw the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) in any type of massage setting. I never witnessed the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) in any inappropriate setting in any way. The [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) was never inappropriate with anybody. In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects.”

Maybe that’s true. Maybe it’s not. In any event, she offered her statements while [seeking a pardon](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/ghislaine-maxwell-pardon-congress-testimony-rcna221803) from the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), and she has an obvious incentive to say favorable things about the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).

In another line of questioning tailored to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s personal interest, [Blanche](https://www.justice.gov/dag/) asked Maxwell about a book she compiled that was given to Epstein for his 50th birthday. The birthday book is of interest to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) because he recently [sued The Wall Street Journal for defamation](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/wall-street-journal-trump-epstein-lawsuit-rcna219968) after it published a story saying that the collection contained a “bawdy” letter bearing [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s name that, [according to the Journal story](https://www.wsj.com/politics/trump-jeffrey-epstein-birthday-letter-we-have-certain-things-in-common-f918d796?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAg3zXc0PZ6R159c8B_Nk7NTjlUZYGu-eTJcCLYaRnU2q9pZEjHGCtqe&gaa_ts=687e43cd&gaa_sig=DxKiAsWEZrzyxHAnioY4JWjIpd989E3g29tR4vGxEqiIZ6tYjjqjm7u0unOhPHk3eJgmHf1PoNbFRv78SkcGXQ%3D%3D):

> *contains several lines of typewritten text framed by the outline of a naked woman, which appears to be hand-drawn with a heavy marker. A pair of small arcs denotes the woman’s breasts, and the future [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s signature is a squiggly ‘[Donald](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’ below her waist, mimicking pubic hair.*

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has denied writing the letter or drawing the picture, stating, “This is not me. This is a fake thing. It’s a fake [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com) story.”

According to the Maxwell interview transcript, [Blanche](https://www.justice.gov/dag/) asked her, “Do you remember [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) submitting a letter or a card or a note?” She replied, “I don’t.”

After she met with [Blanche](https://www.justice.gov/dag/), [the government moved her](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/ghislaine-maxwell-moved-federal-prison-texas-rcna222497) to a minimum security facility. She currently has a petition [petition pending before the Supreme Court](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-ghislaine-maxwell-review-private-conference-rcna221981) to try to overturn her conviction and 20-year sentence.

Maxwell’s lawyer issued a statement in response to the release, saying in part, “We are thankful to the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) and to [Todd Blanche](https://www.justice.gov/dag/) for making these tapes and transcripts public so that people can judge for themselves.”
