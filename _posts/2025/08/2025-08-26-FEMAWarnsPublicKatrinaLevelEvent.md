## [FEMA insiders warn the public: Team Trump’s agenda risks a Katrina-level disaster](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/fema-katrina-letter-congress-trump-rcna227202)

*[FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/) insiders issued a joint statement warning [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) and the public “of the cascading effects of decisions made by the current [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/).”*

Aug. 26, 2025, 9:35 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

As the first year of Donald [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s second term unfolds, it’s common to hear people ask whether there are still responsible people working within the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/), who are willing to take a stand in support of Americans’ interests. Are all the honorable public servants gone?

The answer is no — and the evidence comes by way of “dissent” letters.

In recent months, against a backdrop of [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) radicalism and authoritarian ambitions, officials at a growing number of departments and agencies have signed onto joint statements that condemn what they’ve seen behind the scenes. To date, these “dissent” letters have been issued by employees at agencies that include the [National Institutes of Health,](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/bethesda-declaration-nih-protest-trump-public-health-rcna212120), [NASA](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/resignations-dissent-letter-suggest-trump-put-nasas-future-doubt-rcna220211), the [Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/30/climate/epa-employees-warning-letter.html) and the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/22/science/trump-science-foundation-letter.html).

This week, the list grew longer. [The New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/25/climate/fema-employees-letter-trump-katrina.html):

> *Employees at the [Federal Emergency Management Agency](https://www.fema.gov/) wrote to [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) on Monday warning that the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) had reversed much of the progress made in disaster response and recovery since Hurricane Katrina pummeled the Gulf Coast two decades ago. The letter to [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/), titled the ‘Katrina Declaration,’ rebuked [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s plan to drastically scale down [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/) and shift more responsibility for disaster response — and more costs — to the states.*

The name of the document serves a couple of purposes: Not only was it issued around the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, but its signatories also warn that the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s agenda and plans for the agency risk creating another Katrina-level disaster in the coming months and years.

“Our shared commitment to our country, our oaths of office, and our mission of helping people before, during, and after disasters compel us to warn [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) and the American people of the cascading effects of decisions made by the current [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/),” the letter states.

An [Associated Press report](https://apnews.com/article/fema-letter-kristi-noem-disasters-836712f383a8b7d393c5ebf0f80143cf) added, “The statement in it is noteworthy not only for its content but for its overall existence; a fierce approach toward critics by the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has caused many in the federal government to hesitate before locking heads with the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).”

The developments hardly come out of nowhere. Indeed, it was just a month ago when [Ken Pagurek / LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ken-pagurek-26861b1/), who led [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/)’s Urban Search and Rescue branch, [resigned in frustration](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/questions-femas-future-grow-louder-latest-resignation-rcna220279), arguing that the agency’s slow and bureaucratic response to deadly flooding in central Texas was the last straw.

It’s worth emphasizing that throughout his second term, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s line on the future of [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/) hasn’t left his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) with a lot of wiggle room: As far as [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [was concerned](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-suggests-femas-future-doubt-gets-way-rcna188923), the agency’s days were numbered.

“[FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/) is getting in the way of everything,” the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) argued earlier this year, failing to explain what that meant. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) soon after said he [saw the agency](https://x.com/Acyn/status/1882965826682442124) as [an unnecessary department](https://x.com/atrupar/status/1882965415954944258) that should be “[TERMINATED](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)/113985962341531654).” Around the same time, [Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/)  [Secretary Kristi Noem](), whose [Cabinet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/[administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)/the-cabinet/) department oversees the emergency response agency, added, “We’re going to eliminate [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/).”

Soon after, Cameron Hamilton, a [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-appointed [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/) chief and a lifelong conservative [Republican](https://www.gop.com/), [was fired](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/fema-chief-fired-cameron-hamilton-trump-rcna205676) because he testified before [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) and told lawmakers that it would be in the public’s interest if [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/) continued to exist. Hamilton was replaced by [David Richardson](), who has no background in emergency management, and who, on his first day as the agency’s acting chief, told [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/)’s staff that he would “[run right over](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/05/09/fema-head-run-right-over-staff/83533958007/?tbref=hp)” anyone who gets in his way.

Recently, the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [started hedging a bit](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/texas-flood-team-trump-faces-uncomfortable-questions-femas-future-rcna217461) on its plans to shutter [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/), [opening the door](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/11/trump-fema-texas-floods/) to an agency that might be overhauled but not necessarily “terminated.” But even if [Team Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) allows [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/) to exist, many of those with first-hand knowledge about how the agency works believe [Team Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is setting up [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/) to fail.
