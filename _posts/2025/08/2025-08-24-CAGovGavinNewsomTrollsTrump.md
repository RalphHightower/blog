## [Why Gavin Newsom's social media posts trolling Trump are so effective](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/gavin-newsom-trump-tweets-social-media-posts-troll-response-rcna226324)

*[Newsom](https://www.gov.ca.gov/about/) boxes in his critics while illustrating the absurdity of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s communication style.*

Aug. 23, 2025, 6:00 AM EDT
By Zeeshan Aleem, MSNBC Opinion Writer/Editor

[Gov. Gavin Newsom has unlocked a new strategy](https://www.msnbc.com/all-in/watch/-donald-is-finished-newsom-goes-on-offense-with-trump-mockery-campaign-245323333603) for exciting [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) voters online and getting under [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/)’ skin: [acting like President Donald Trump.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/gavin-newsom-strikes-nerve-seizes-spotlight-treads-trumps-turf-rcna225778).

On X in recent weeks, [Newsom](https://www.gov.ca.gov/about/)’s press office account has relentlessly mimicked [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s PR style by writing narcissistic, insult-laden posts, often in all capital letters and littered with needless parentheticals and strangely placed quotation marks. Here’s [Newsom](https://www.gov.ca.gov/about/)’s social media account panning [Trump’s press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-putin-summit-russia-ukraine-what-happens-next-rcna225433) — and then pivoting to tout [Newsom](https://www.gov.ca.gov/about/)’s initiative to [redraw the state’s congressional districts](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/california-map-redistricting-vote-texas-gerrymandering-newsom-rcna226379) to counteract [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/)’ redistricting efforts:

> *[TRUMP](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) JUST FLED THE PODIUM WITH [PUTIN](http://government.ru/) — NO QUESTIONS, NOTHING! TOTAL LOW ENERGY. THE MAN LOOKED LIKE HE’D JUST EATEN 3 BUCKETS OF [KFC](https://www.kfc.com/) WITH VLAD. IS HE AFRAID THE PRESS WILL ASK ABOUT ME??? (AMERICA’S FAVORITE GOVERNOR) AND THE FACT I “STOLE THE CAMERAS” THIS WEEK WITH “THE MAPS”? MANY PEOPLE ARE SAYING HE BEGGED PUTIN TO HOLD HIS HANDS (TINY) ON THE WAY OUT. ADMIT IT, [DONNIE J](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)… YOU’RE TERRIFIED BECAUSE THIS WAS THE WORST WEEK OF YOUR LIFE BECAUSE OF ME, [GAVIN C. NEWSOM](https://www.gov.ca.gov/about/). “THE MAPS” WILL END YOUR PRESIDENCY, RETAKE [CONGRESS](https://www.congress.gov/) FOR THE PEOPLE, AND EXPOSE YOUR RIGGED “LITTLE GAME.”*

[Newsom](https://www.gov.ca.gov/about/) seems to be having fun. He’s reposting AI-generated memes of [his face carved onto Mount Rushmore](https://x.com/GovPressOffice/status/1957451025310199852) (“WHAT AN HONOR!”). He’s putting down his Republican opponents (“NOT EVEN HIS EYELINER LINES LOOK AS PRETTY AS CALIFORNIA 'MAP' LINES,” [he said of Vice President JD Vance](https://x.com/GovPressOffice/status/1956816352947438048).) He [spread a meme](https://x.com/GovPressOffice/status/1956432892026089486) falsely claiming there were “worldwide calls” for him to receive the [Nobel](https://www.nobelprize.org/) [Peace Prize](https://www.nobelpeaceprize.org/), skewering [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s obsession with securing one. And, as [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) commonly does on [Liars Club](https://truthsocial.com/), [Newsom)(https://www.gov.ca.gov/about/)’s been ending some posts with “THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER!”

### Democrats appear to be excited about Newsom’s willingness to be a pugilist online.

[Newsom](https://www.gov.ca.gov/about/)’s social media posts have been exploding in popularity. In part because [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) appear to be excited about [Newsom](https://www.gov.ca.gov/about/)’s willingness to be a pugilist online — particularly as he’s taking extraordinary steps to [fight back against Texas’ outrageous gerrymandering scheme](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-texas-redistricting-democrats-california-newsom-hochul-rcna223530). But also because some of the posts are genuinely entertaining and surprising, especially coming from a Democrat who typically presents as exceedingly clean-cut and careful.

[Newsom](https://www.gov.ca.gov/about/) is clearly in an experimental phase in his political career and has not yet settled on a lane as a potential 2028 [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) contender. Earlier this year he [launched a podcast](https://x.com/GovPressOffice/status/1956816352947438048), and his chumminess with the right-wing pundits he invited on suggested he was shifting to the right. But this summer [Newsom](https://www.gov.ca.gov/about/) became a liberal resistance hero as he offered [sharp takedowns of Trump’s federalization of California’s National Guard](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/gavin-newsom-trump-la-protests-los-angeles-rcna212664) and offered a full-throated defense of undocumented immigrants in his state. Now the combination of the redistricting battle and his social media antics suggest a new chapter: a willingness to play the game the way [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) does.

An interesting feature of [Newsom](https://www.gov.ca.gov/about/)’s strategy is that by mirroring [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) he simultaneously parodies him and boxes in [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) critics. “Stop it with the Twitter thing,” [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) host [Dana Perino](https://www.foxnews.com/person/p/dana-perino) [said](https://x.com/RpsAgainstTrump/status/1957677561590202767) on Monday. “I don’t know where his wife is. If I were his wife I would say, ‘You are making a fool of yourself, stop it.’” [Perino](https://www.foxnews.com/person/p/dana-perino) added, “He’s got a big job as [governor](https://www.gov.ca.gov/) of [California](https://www.ca.gov/), but if he wants an even bigger job, he has to be a little more serious.”

Another [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) host, [Trace Gallagher](https://www.foxnews.com/person/g/trace-gallagher), [also tried](https://x.com/Acyn/status/1956565151815197115) to slam [Newsom](https://www.gov.ca.gov/about/): “I don’t know what he’s trying to do, but it comes across as childish and — you are the governor of the biggest state in the union — what are you doing?!” But there’s no way for right-wingers to make such arguments without implying that the president of the United States’ posts are unserious and foolish.

[Trump recently posted](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115064763272706560) on [Liars Club](https://truthsocial.com/), “Gavin Newscum is way down in the polls. He is viewed as the man who is destroying the once Great State of California. I will save California!!!” It’s unclear if [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was inspired to say it by [Newsom](https://www.gov.ca.gov/about/)’s social media posts, or Newsom’s redistricting efforts — or both — but it does suggest [Newsom](https://www.gov.ca.gov/about/) is on [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s mind.

[Newsom](https://www.gov.ca.gov/about/) obviously cannot ride this train all the way to the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). But his new routine represents a rare foray by a politician from a largely milquetoast and earnest party toward something playful, transgressive and edgy. The real challenge ahead for [Newsom](https://www.gov.ca.gov/about/) and his colleagues is to carve out something of their own that excites the public.
