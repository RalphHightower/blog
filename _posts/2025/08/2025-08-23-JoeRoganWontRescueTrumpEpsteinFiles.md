Podcast host [Joe Rogan](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/joe-rogan-trump-crazy-foreign-students-ozturk-rcna222064) has continued to hammer [Donald Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/donald-trump) and his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) over their handling of the [Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/jeffrey-epstein-investigation-timeline-trump-rcna226134) case. On Tuesday, the influential commentator slammed [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) over his repeated claims that the scandal is a “hoax” that’s been “perpetrated by the [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/).”

“It’s certainly not a hoax if Ghislaine Maxwell is in jail, too,” [Rogan](http://www.youtube.com/@joerogan) said. “She’s in jail for sex trafficking, but the question is, to who? You have to be sex trafficking to someone in order to go to jail, right? So how’s that work?”

The [“Joe Rogan Experience”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5V6ciwu2s) host said Americans were “never gonna forget” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s response to the growing scandal and warned [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) that the issue could come back to bite them in future elections.

“The problem is, do we have any power? What do we do? You know, what do you do?” [Rogan](http://www.youtube.com/@joerogan) asked. “You definitely can change the way you vote.”

On Wednesday’s [“Deadline: White House,”](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house) Nicolle Wallace underscored the importance of the popular podcaster’s reminder.

“On the scale of momentous and impossible to ignore, [Joe Rogan](http://www.youtube.com/@joerogan) reminding his millions of listeners that they can change the people they vote for is a clear sign that [Joe Rogan](http://www.youtube.com/@joerogan) is not going to become [Lindsey Graham (T-SC)](https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/) in this story,” Wallace said, referring to attempts by the [South Carolina](https://www.sc.gov/) [senator](https://www.senate.gov/) and close [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) ally to [downplay the controversy.](https://abcnews4.com/news/local/sen-graham-echoes-trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-in-downplaying-epstein-case-urges-moving-on-from-controversy-lindsey-graham-news-wciv-abc-news-4-7-17-2025).

“He’s refusing to buy the BS being peddled by the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and rescue [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) from a crisis of his own making: his botched handling of the Jeffrey Epstein scandal,” she said.

Wallace also discussed what she called a “significant” new court ruling in the case. On Wednesday, a third federal judge [denied a motion](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/jeffrey-epstein-grand-jury-transcripts-unsealed-ruling-rcna224551) from the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) to unseal grand jury transcripts. By doing so, Wallace said the judge had thrown cold water on [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) “and his bid to appear transparent and quell this political firestorm.”
