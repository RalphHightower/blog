## [JD Vance puts a weird twist on Team Trump’s line on the Epstein files](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jd-vance-puts-weird-twist-team-trumps-line-epstein-files-rcna224381)

*When it comes to talking points on the Epstein files, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and the [vice president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) are not exactly on the same page.*

By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

As political issues go, the Jeffrey Epstein scandal wasn’t exactly front-page news for much of the year, but the more [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) talked about it, and the more the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s rhetoric proved provocative, the more the controversy intensified.

Part of the problem is that the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has struggled to keep its story straight. Last week, for example, [Trump told reporters](https://bsky.app/profile/acyn.bsky.social/post/3lv77edtzjz2p) that the entire mess was “a scam set up by the [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/)” — a bizarre argument, given his own [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) allies pushed the issue for years — before he added that it was [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) who “controlled” the Epstein files during the [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) era.

The more one thinks about this, the less sense it makes. The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) would have Americans believe that rascally [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) “controlled” the Epstein files, manipulated it to their hearts’ content, only then to let it gather dust, leaving it on [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general)’s desk.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s line, in other words, wasn’t just self-defeating, it was also the sort of rhetoric that generated fresh speculation about why the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) seemed so eager to discredit the files.

A few days later, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [vice president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/[administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)/jd-vance/) sat down with [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/)’ [Maria Bartiromo](https://www.foxnews.com/person/b/maria-bartiromo), and [JD Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) tried a different kind of talking point:

> *We know that Jeffrey Epstein had a lot of connections with left-wing politicians and left-wing billionaires. ... [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) [sic] billionaires and [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) [sic] political leaders went to Epstein island all the time. Who knows what they did.*

The [Ohio Republican](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) added that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has “demanded full transparency” on the issue.

For now, let’s not dwell on the fact that [Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) offered no evidence of [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) donors or officials having done anything wrong. For that matter, we can brush past the fact that the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s line on the Epstein files obviously falls far short of “full transparency.”

What I find notable, however, is the gap between the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s line and the [vice president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/)’s.

To hear [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) tell it, those darned [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) might’ve put incriminating information about him in the Epstein files. To hear [Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) tell it, those [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) rascals might’ve actually hidden dirt on other [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/).

But if that were true, why doesn’t the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) just release the files? Why bother with the secrecy and contradictory stories if the [vice president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) is correct and it’s “left-wing politicians and left-wing billionaires” who joined [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) on Epstein’s list of friends?
