[Laura Loomer](https://www.loomered.com/) describes herself as a "pro-white nationalist" and a "proud Islamophobe".

## [Army rescinds former Biden official's West Point job offer after Laura Loomer complains](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/army-rescinds-easterly-job-offer-laura-loomer-cisa-trump-rcna222282)

*The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has ousted more than a dozen people opposed by [Loomer](https://www.loomered.com/), a far-right conspiracy theorist, according to one tally.*

ðŸ“° Main Developments
Job Rescinded at West Point: The [U.S. Army](https://www.army.mil/) withdrew its offer to Jen Easterly, former [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) official and ex-director of [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/), to serve as a distinguished chair at West Pointâ€™s social sciences department.

Triggering Complaint: The decision followed public complaints by far-right activist [Laura Loomer](https://www.loomered.com/), who alleged a vetting failure and misinformation about Easterlyâ€™s ties to controversial figures.

[Administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) Response: [Army](https://www.army.mil/) Secretary Dan Driscoll confirmed the withdrawal on social media, apparently influenced by [Loomer](https://www.loomered.com/)â€™s claims.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)â€™s Personnel Shake-ups: Since January, over a dozen government officials criticized by [Loomer](https://www.loomered.com/) have been dismissed, pointing to her outsized influence over MAGA-aligned personnel decisions.

ðŸ”¥ Political Undercurrents
[CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/) Under Fire: [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and allies have long accused the agency of anti-conservative bias, despite it being founded during his own term.

Disinfo Misdirection: [Loomer](https://www.loomered.com/) falsely linked Easterly to Nina Jankowicz and [Biden]()â€™s Disinformation Governance Boardâ€”both women denied any connection.

Ideological Indoctrination: [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) appointed MAGA loyalists (like Michael Flynn) to West Pointâ€™s oversight board, raising concerns over politicization of military education.

This reflects a broader pattern: the entanglement of personnel decisions with fringe influencer approval in an increasingly ideologically driven [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/).
