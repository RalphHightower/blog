title: "Trump Doesn't Qualify For the Nobel Peace Prize"
---

- Primary requisite to be considered for the [Nobel Peace Prize "](https://www.nobelpeaceprize.org/):
    - “who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.”

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) fails to meet that high standard.

1. He has failed to end the war between [Israel](https://www.gov.il/) and Gaza.
2. He has failed to end the war between [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/) and [Russia](http://government.ru/)
3. But, importantly, he has divided the world with his tariff trade wars with the world.
4. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has divided the United States of America.

*The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is desperately lobbying for a Nobel — while backing war and chaos around the world.*

Aug. 17, 2025, 6:00 AM EDT
By Zeeshan Aleem, MSNBC Opinion Writer/Editor

This summer, [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is [rolling out the red carpet for Russian President Vladimir Putin](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-putin-summit-russia-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-rcna224593) and [approving of weapon sales to [
Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-agencies-approve-510-million-sale-of-bomb-guidance-kits-to-israel/) as it [commits genocide](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/israel-genocide-meaning-definition-gaza-democrats-rcna221477). He’s also squeezing in time to lobby aggressively for the [Nobel Peace Prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/).

[NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/) [reports](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-ramps-campaign-nobel-peace-prize-ahead-putin-meeting-rcna224554) that “[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his aides are intensifying a public campaign to snag the award, citing a string of [peace deals](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/08/president-trump-brokers-another-historic-peace-deal/) while making a case that snubbing him again would be an injustice.” According to [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/), [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) press secretary Karoline Leavitt has said, unprompted, at three out of her four press briefings in July that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) deserves the prize. In fact, she’s arguing it’s overdue: “It’s well past time that [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was awarded the [Nobel Peace Prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/),” she said at one presser. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has also “posted about the prize a total of seven times on his social media site since his second term began, six of them in June and July,” [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/) reports.

> *[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s foreign policy has often undermined global 'fraternity,' not fostered it.*

The [Nobel Peace Prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/) is awarded by a five-member body appointed by [Norway](http://www.regjeringen.no/)’s parliament. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has reportedly tried to influence the group through talks with the country’s government. A [Norwegian news outlet](https://www.dn.no/) [reported Thursday](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/trump-asked-norwegian-minister-about-nobel-prize-newspaper-says-2025-08-14/) that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said that he wanted the [Nobel Peace Prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/) during a July call with [Norwegian](https://www.regjeringen.no/) [Finance Minister](https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dep/fin/id216/) [Jens Stoltenberg](https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dep/fin/org/finansminister-jens-stoltenberg/id3086196/) to discuss tariffs. (According to [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/), a [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) official “said that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and [Stoltenberg](https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dep/fin/org/finansminister-jens-stoltenberg/id3086196/) did speak, but could not say that the conversation was focused on the prize. [Stoltenberg](https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dep/fin/org/finansminister-jens-stoltenberg/id3086196/) confirmed in a statement that he spoke to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) about tariffs but would not go into further details of the call.”)

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Nobel Prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/) campaign — and his conviction that he is entitled to one — is of course absurd. Alfred Nobel [called in his will](https://www.nobelpeaceprize.org/nobel-peace-prize/about-the-nobel-peace-prize/) for the prize to be awarded to individuals “who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.” How would [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) fit the bill?

There is some truth to the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s claim that it has played a diplomatic role in mediating the end of conflict between some nations, including between [India](https://www.india.gov.in/) and [Pakistan](https://www.pakistan.gov.pk/) and between [Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo.](https://www.usip.org/publications/2025/07/what-drc-rwanda-peace-deal-means-us-and-africas-mineral-rich-great-lakes). However in the case of [India](https://www.india.gov.in/) and [Pakistan](https://www.pakistan.gov.pk/), [India](https://www.india.gov.in/) objects to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s claim that he was responsible for the May ceasefire between [India](https://www.india.gov.in/) and [Pakistan](https://www.pakistan.gov.pk/); the [India](https://www.india.gov.in/)n government [describes](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89ew9wde3lo) the resolution as something that was brokered bilaterally between only [India](https://www.india.gov.in/) and [Pakistan](https://www.pakistan.gov.pk/), and has downplayed [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s role. And in the case of [Rwanda](https://www.gov.rw/) and the [DRC](https://republique.cd/), [Qatar](httpshukoomi.gov.qa/) [also played a critical role](https://www.justsecurity.org/118753/drc-rwanda-accord-military/) that the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has conveniently left out of its narrative.

Even granting that the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has played a role in conflict resolution between some countries, the general spirit of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s foreign policy has often undermined global “fraternity,” not fostered it. Under the banner of “America First,” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has shattered the bonds of economic cooperation by launching global trade wars, has reneged on [pivotal agreements with our neighbors,](https://www.msnbc.com/ayman-mohyeldin/watch/trump-slaps-tariffs-on-canada-mexico-and-china-230875717796), and turned long-standing [allies in Europe into rivals.](https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/02/21/us-europe-trump-vance-speech-nato-russia/).

On a particularly surreal note, one of the mediation agreements that the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) [lists](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/08/president-trump-brokers-another-historic-peace-deal/) in its case for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) as a “president of peace” is the recent ceasefire between [Israel](https://www.gov.il/) and [Iran](https://irangov.ir/). Somehow [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) fails to mention that that ceasefire came after the [U.S. and Israel bombed Iran.](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/israel-iran-war-regime-us-trump-rcna213332). Moreover, those attacks were carried out during negotiations to secure a diplomatic agreement that would’ve brought more safety to the Middle East and served the end of nuclear nonproliferation. A nuclear deal with [Iran](https://irangov.ir/) now remains further from reach than ever.

And on two of the biggest U.S. foreign policy issues of the day, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) should not be asking for a pat on the back. He should be asking for forgiveness. He has supported [Israel](https://www.gov.il/) as it [has killed civilians en masse in Gaza](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/israel-genocide-meaning-definition-gaza-democrats-rcna221477) and effectively encouraged its ethnic cleansing project by talking about [turning Gaza into an international beach resort](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-gaza-riviera-echoes-kushner-waterfront-property-dreams-2025-02-05/). And while [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s efforts to help end [Russia](http://government.ru/)’s war on [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/) is, in the abstract, a good thing, his extraordinary deference toward [Russia](http://government.ru/) during negotiations reflects a pursuit of an imperialistic, autocrat-friendly “peace” in the global order.

“[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s desire to win the [Nobel Peace Prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/) has become something of a joke in foreign capitals,” a former British diplomat [told NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-ramps-campaign-nobel-peace-prize-ahead-putin-meeting-rcna224554). “His claims to [Canada, Panama, Greenland, etc.,](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-gulf-mexico-america-greenland-panama-canal-rcna186632), etc., as well as tariff wars and the assaults on America’s democratic institutions, incline governments in the opposite direction.”

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s demand for a [Nobel Peace Prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/) while causing global chaos and backing imperialism is yet another stroke of Orwellian audacity from our [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). I hope the committee does not repeat its past mistake of [pre-emptively awarding one to a U.S. president in an ill-conceived attempt at encouraging good behavior.](https://www.cato.org/commentary/revoke-obamas-nobel-peace-prize) At a time of rampant corruption and authoritarianism, it’s important for global institutions to protect their credibility and do what they can to stand for the idea of a truly peaceful and just world order.
