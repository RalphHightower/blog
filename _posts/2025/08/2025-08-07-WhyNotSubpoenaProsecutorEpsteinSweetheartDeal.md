## [Why don’t Republicans want to talk to the prosecutor who made Epstein’s ‘sweetheart deal’?](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/dont-republicans-want-talk-prosecutor-made-epsteins-sweetheart-deal-rcna223597)

*Logic suggests the congressional investigation into the Jeffrey Epstein scandal would include a subpoena for Alex Acosta. So what happened?*

Aug. 7, 2025, 9:49 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

A couple of weeks ago, [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/,) [Markwayne Mullin (T-OK)](https://www.mullin.senate.gov/) sat down with [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/)’s [Jake Tapper](https://www.cnn.com/profiles/jake-tapper-profile) and did his best to try to deflect blame in the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. The effort [went quite badly](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/targeting-epsteins-sweetheart-deal-senate-republican-forgets-was-presi-rcna221432), however, for an important reason: The [Oklahoma Republican](https://www.mullin.senate.gov/) couldn’t quite remember who was [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) in 2008.

As the [far-right senator](https://www.mullin.senate.gov/) tried to argue, Epstein received “a sweetheart plea deal” from prosecutors in the [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/), an arrangement that [Mullin](https://www.mullin.senate.gov/) claimed “has not been exposed.” It fell to [Tapper](https://www.cnn.com/profiles/jake-tapper-profile) to [remind his confused guest](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/targeting-epsteins-sweetheart-deal-senate-republican-forgets-was-presi-rcna221432) that the late millionaire pedophile did benefit from a generous deal, but it was in 2008, that [Barack Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) wasn’t [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) in 2008, and that the agreement was exposed years ago.

The incident did, however, serve as a timely reminder that it was Alex Acosta who helped orchestrate Epstein’s deal — and it was [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) who added Acosta to his [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Cabinet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/) during the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)’s [first term](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/).

It’s against this backdrop that [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/congress-doesnt-want-talk-alex-acosta-epsteins-sweetheart-deal-maker-rcna223543):

> *The [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Committee on Oversight and Government Reform](https://oversight.house.gov/) on Tuesday listed former attorneys general, a former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director, former [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Bill Clinton](https://clintonwhitehouse2.archives.gov/) and former [Secretary of State](https://www.state.gov/) Hillary Clinton as people all subject to subpoenas for matters tied to Jeffrey Epstein. However, not named in the news release was Alex Acosta — who was the U.S. attorney for the [Southern District of Florida](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/) whose secret non-prosecution agreement with Epstein created a spark that has turned into an inferno of controversy nearly 20 years later.*

The report added that victims of Epstein’s sexual abuse are unhappy that Acosta was not among those subpoenaed.

An attorney for one of his victims said, “How can any genuine investigation into the federal government’s sweetheart deal with Epstein (including the extraordinary grant of blanket immunity to all his named and unnamed co-conspirators) omit Alex Acosta?”

Given the circumstances, that’s hardly an unreasonable question.

As longtime readers [might recall](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/justice-dept-take-closer-look-jeffrey-epsteins-plea-deal-msna1192476), Epstein ended up pleading guilty to a state charge of soliciting sex from a minor in 2008, which led to an 18-month sentence. He was released after 13 months — during which time he was permitted to leave the prison and go to work during much of the day — and he then went back to [living the high life](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/jeffrey-epstein-multi-millionaire-sex-offender-settles-suit-apologizes-n943481).

How in the world did Epstein get such a generous deal, given the number of his underage victims? Because the agreement was approved by the local, [Bush](https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/)-appointed U.S. attorney, Acosta, whose team went around the federal prosecutor investigating the case, the [FBI](https:///www.fbi.gov/) and the victims.

A federal judge later [questioned the legality of the agreement](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/the-scandal-could-force-out-another-trump-cabinet-secretary-msna1197486).

As for why [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) added Acosta to his [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Cabinet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/) despite all of this, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) hasn’t yet elaborated on the decision. In the meantime, Acosta is denying comment, and the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)-led House [Oversight Committee](https://oversight.house.gov/), led by [Rep.](https://www.gop.com/) [James Comer (T-KY1)](https://comer.house.gov/), hasn’t fully explained why Acosta wasn’t included in its big batch of subpoenas.
