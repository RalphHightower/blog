## [Just how far would Trump go in his quest for a Nobel prize?](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/nobel-peace-prize-donald-trump-rcna225248)

*Asked about the [Nobel](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/) [Peace Prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/), the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) insisted, “I’m not politicking for it.” It instantly became one of his more outlandish lies.*

Aug. 15, 2025, 1:01 PM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

At a [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) late last week, a reporter reminded [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), “The [Norwegian](https://www.regjeringen.no/) [Nobel Committee](https://www.nobelprize.org/the-nobel-prize-organisation/) will make their announcement as it relates to this year’s [Nobel](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/) [Peace Prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/) on Friday, October 10.” The reporter then asked the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), “Is that date circled on your calendar?”

As part of the [Republican](https://www.gop.com%)’s answer, [he replied](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-trilateral-agreement-armenia-azerbaijan-august-8-2025/), “I’m not politicking for it.”

No, of course not. Perish the thought. It’s not as if the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), just a few days after the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) said he wasn’t lobbying for the honor, released a list of foreign officials who’ve nominated him for the award alongside a picture of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and the medal. Wait, actually, that’s exactly what happened.

The post was ridiculous, but it was part of a larger effort. [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) officials and [Secretary of](https://www.state.gov/secretary) [State](https://www.state.gov/) [Marco Rubio](https://www.state.gov/biographies/marco-rubio/) have [called on](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-house-lobbying-nobel-prize-trump-takes-farcical-turn-rcna222492) the [Nobel](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/) committee [to reward Trump](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5172083-rubio-says-trump-would-be-on-his-way-to-the-nobel-peace-prize-if-he-were-a-democrat/); foreign leaders eager to curry favor with the [American president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [have nominated him](https://apnews.com/article/trump-netanyahu-nobel-prize-peace-544b703c161c13d9e14f1529df8a2669) for the honor; he’s [repeatedly complained](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/all-the-times-trump-complained-about-not-getting-a-nobel-peace-prize) about not having already received the award and [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has [publicly listed reasons](https://rollcall.com/2025/08/12/not-politicking-for-it-trump-goes-all-in-on-nobel-push-with-risky-putin-summit/) that he believes “they should give me the [Nobel Prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/) Prize.”

[NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/) [reported this week](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-ramps-campaign-nobel-peace-prize-ahead-putin-meeting-rcna224554), “Any whiff of indifference is now gone. ... [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his aides are intensifying a public campaign to snag the award.”

But don’t worry: The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has already assured the public that he’s “not politicking for it.”

The question isn’t whether the comment was foolish, since it obviously was. Rather, the question is just how far the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is prepared to go to lobby for an honor that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has [been desperate to receive for many years](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-house-lobbying-nobel-prize-trump-takes-farcical-turn-rcna222492).

It was against this backdrop that [Politico reported](https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-called-norway-finance-minister-ask-about-nobel-peace-prize/):

> *[U.S. President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) called [Norway](https://www.regjeringen.no/)’s [Finance Minister](https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dep/fin/id216/) [Jens Stoltenberg](https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dep/fin/org/finansminister-jens-stoltenberg/id3086196/) out of the blue last month to discuss trade tariffs — as well as his bid to win the [Nobel](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/) [Peace Prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/). The call was first reported by Norwegian newspaper [Dagens Næringsliv](https://www.dn.no/) on Thursday and was later confirmed to [Politico](https://www.politico.com/) by a government official in [Oslo](https://www.oslo.kommune.no/). This was not the first time [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) had raised the prize in discussions with [Stoltenberg](https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dep/fin/org/finansminister-jens-stoltenberg/id3086196/), [Dagens Næringsliv](https://www.dn.no/) noted.*

The reporting has not been independently verified by [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) or [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/), and the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) didn’t respond to a request for comment. For his part, [Stoltenberg](https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dep/fin/org/finansminister-jens-stoltenberg/id3086196/) confirmed on the record that [Truump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) did call him, but said in a statement that he would not “go into further detail about the content of the conversation.”

The official announcement is 56 days away. I shudder to think how much the campaign will intensify between now and then.
