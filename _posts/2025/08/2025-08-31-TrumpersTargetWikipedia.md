There is a double standard between [Trumpians](https://www.gop.com/) and [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/).

[X](https://x.com/)/[Twitter](https://twitter.com/) has become a cesspool of bigotry and hate speech. 

As of April 27, 2023, I deactivated my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) account based on this [Elon Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk/) tweet:<br />[@ElonMusk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1651602599345373186): *Anyone making materially false statements on this platform will get Community Noted, including you, me, Tucker, advertisers, head of state, etc. No exceptions. <br />Convince the people and let the chips fall where they may.* <br />@RalphHightower: Seriously? Yet you welcomed back a pathological liar, [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), who incited and welcomed violence in an attempted coup d'état on January 6 in the storming of the U.S. Capitol. Twitter has gone to ***HELL!***

*[House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) are probing the online encyclopedia over claims of foreign manipulation, anti-[Israel](https://www.gov.il/) bias and antisemitism.*

Aug. 31, 2025, 6:00 AM EDT
By [Ja'han Jones](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jahan-jones-ncpn371241)

[House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) have launched an investigation into [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/), a long-standing target of conservative criticism.

For several months, Elon Musk and other conservatives [waged a campaign](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/02/elon-musk-wikipedia/681577/) to portray the online encyclopedia as an oppressive tool of leftist manipulation.

Now a [House](https://www.house.gov/) committee is investigating allegations of "anti-Israel bias" at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/).

- [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Oversight Committee](https://oversight.house.gov/) [Chairman](https://oversight.house.gov/chairman-james-comer/) [James Comer (T-KY1)](https://comer.house.gov/) [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Nancy Mace (T-SC)](https://mace.house.gov/), who leads a subcommittee on cybersecurity, [sent a letter](https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/082725-letter-to-Wikimedia.pdf) to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/)’s CEO demanding data, documents and answers to questions stemming primarily from allegations — [laid out in a March Anti-Defamation League report](https://www.adl.org/resources/report/editing-hate-how-anti-israel-and-anti-jewish-bias-undermines-wikipedias-neutrality) — that [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/) editors were permitting anti-[Israel](https://www.gov.il/) rhetoric and antisemitic themes to spread on the platform.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/) officials [have refuted the report](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/20/tech/wikipedia-adl-report-antisemitism-bias), saying it included “unsupported and problematic claims.” But the letter says the report “raised troubling questions about potentially systematic efforts to advance antisemitic and anti-[Israel](https://www.gov.il/) information in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/) articles related to conflicts with the [State of Israel](https//www.gov.il/).” The lawmakers also reference [an Atlantic Council report](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/exposing-pravda-how-pro-kremlin-forces-are-poisoning-ai-models-and-rewriting-wikipedia/) that found pro-[Kremlin](http://kremlin.ru/) forces have used artificial intelligence tools to help whitewash and rewrite the story of [Russia](http://government.ru/)’s war with [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/).

“The [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Oversight Committee[(https://oversight.house.gov/ is investigating manipulation efforts to determine the role and methods of foreign individuals, those at academic institutions subsidized by United States taxpayer dollars, as well as [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/)’s awareness and response,” [according to a release from Comer’s office](https://oversight.house.gov/release/comer-and-mace-investigate-efforts-to-manipulate-information-on-wikipedia/).

The lawmakers clearly want to target specific [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/) editors. Along with any documents related to state-sponsored efforts to manipulate [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/) entries, they’re demanding “records showing identifying and unique characteristics of accounts (such as names, IP addresses, registration dates, user activity logs) for editors” whose conduct has been evaluated by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/)’s committee for resolving editorial disputes.

A spokesperson for the [Wikimedia Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org/), which runs [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/), told [The Hill](https://thehill.com/) that it welcomes “the opportunity to respond to the [Committee](https://oversight.house.gov/)’s questions and to discuss the importance of safeguarding the integrity of information on our platform.”

The investigation is sure to raise questions, considering that [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) have spent the past several years [denouncing anti-misinformation efforts](https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/jim-jordan-disinformation-censorship-weaponization-cisa-rcna91694) and [demonizing efforts](https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/nina-jankowicz-misinformation-panel-transcripts-rcna153121) to root out foreign manipulation campaigns such as those that [have been known to thrive on MAGA-friendly platforms like the Musk-owned X](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/misinformation/russia-operated-nearly-1000-sock-puppet-accounts-x-justice-department-rcna161004).
