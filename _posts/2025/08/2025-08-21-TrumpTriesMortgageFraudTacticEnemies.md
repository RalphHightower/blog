Embattled [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) [Attorney General](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/) [Ken Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office) has been reported to have three homes listed as primary residences.

## [Team Trump finds something new to weaponize: mortgage fraud allegations](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/team-trump-finds-something-new-weaponize-mortgage-fraud-allegations-rcna226381)

*The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) accused one of the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s political targets of mortgage fraud. Then it happened again. And then it happened again.*

Aug. 21, 2025, 2:39 PM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

Sometimes, there’s political news that’s notable at face value, but just below the surface there’s an even more important story happening. Take [this NBC News report](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/trump-lisa-cook-federal-reserve-feud-flares-up-rcna226049):

> *[T]he director of the [U.S. [Federal Housing Finance Agency](https://www.fhfa.gov/), [William Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte), a sharp critic of the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/), alleged in a letter to [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) that [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) [Governor Lisa Cook](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/cook.htm) ‘falsified bank documents and property records to acquire more favorable loan terms, potentially committing mortgage fraud.’ In the letter that [Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte) called a ‘criminal referral,’ he said that his agency had obtained her mortgage documents and requested that the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) review the matter.*

[Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), who is desperate to bring the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) to heel, responded to the allegations with [a four-word statement](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)/115061104213677946) published to his social media platform: “[Cook](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/cook.htm) must resign, now!!!”

For her part, [Cook](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/cook.htm), an economist named to the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) board by [Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/), [said in a statement](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-russia-ukraine-texas-redistricting-dc-israel-gaza-live-updates-rcna225398/rcrd86836?canonicalCard=true) that she has “no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet.”

At this point, the story probably seems relatively straightforward, even if many of the relevant players are not widely known to the general public: A federal housing official believes a [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) official did something wrong, and the accused has denied wrongdoing. Maybe the Justice Department will pursue the matter, maybe not. Time will tell.

But then there’s the story behind the story.

When the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) recently went after [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Adam Schiff](https://www.schiff.senate.gov/), the case against the [California](https://www.ca.gov/) [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) and frequent [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) target was based on [allegations of mortgage fraud](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/adam-schiff-donald-trump-mortgage-fraud-claim-rcna220584). When the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) went after [state Attorney General](https://ag.ny.gov/) [Letitia James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james), the case against the [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) and frequent [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) target was also based on [allegations of mortgage fraud](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/doj-opens-investigation-new-york-ags-office-brought-fraud-case-trump-rcna223731). This week, evidently, it’s [Cook](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/cook.htm)’s turn.

It’s possible that through some remarkable coincidence, several prominent [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) officials whom the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) doesn’t like have all run afoul of the same law at the same time. But it’s also possible that the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/), eager to retaliate against some of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s favorite political targets, have weaponized mortgage fraud allegations.

[Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte), the head of the [Federal Housing Finance Agency](https://www.fhfa.gov/), [told CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/08/20/fhfa-director-bill-pulte-trump-should-fire-feds-cook-over-claims-of-mortgage-fraud.html) this week that the criminal referrals were not politically motivated. Perhaps. But given everything we know about [Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte), there is some reason for skepticism. The [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) [recently noted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/08/07/bill-pulte-trump-powell/) that the [FHFA](https://www.fhfa.gov/) [chief](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte/) “has made a name for himself as a prominent [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) sidekick.” From the article:

[Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte), 37, has ramped up political infighting. ... He’s become a leading voice for ousting [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) [Board Chair Jerome H. Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm), joining the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) on a tour of the central bank and handing [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) a draft letter for [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm)’s firing that — so far — remains unsent. He posts to social media constantly, like his boss in the [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). ... [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) appears to be impressed. Last month, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) congratulated [Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte) ‘on the outstanding job he is doing.’ In a post on Truth Social, he encouraged [Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte) not to ‘LET THE RADICAL LEFT WEAKLINGS STOP YOU!’

All of which is to say, maybe we’re dealing with a story about a bunch of officials who’ve played fast and loose with their mortgage applications. Or maybe we’re dealing with a story about a federal bureaucracy being used in the service of a partisan vendetta.
