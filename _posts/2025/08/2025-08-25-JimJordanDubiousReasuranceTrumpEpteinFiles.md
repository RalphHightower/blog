## [After seeing Ghislaine Maxwell transcript, Jim Jordan delivers dubious assurances](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/seeing-ghislaine-maxwell-transcript-jim-jordan-delivers-dubious-assura-rcna226991)

*For the [Ohio Republican](https://jordan.house.gov/) to pretend that Ghislaine Maxwell has credibility, and her claims about [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) should be accepted at face value, is ridiculous.*

Aug. 25, 2025, 11:36 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s recent approach to Ghislaine Maxwell has been bizarre. After transferring Jeffrey Epstein’s former confidante to a minimum-security prison — a radical move in its own right, given that she was convicted of sex trafficking — Maxwell sat down for an [unusual interview](https://www.npr.org/2025/07/29/nx-s1-5484129/todd-blanche-epstein-ghislaine-maxwell-trump) with [Deputy](https://www.justice.gov/dag/) [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Todd Blanche](https://www.justice.gov/dag/), [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s former personal defense attorney.

Late last week, as my MSNBC colleague [Jordan Rubin reported](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/ghislaine-maxwell-todd-blanche-doj-transcripts-audio-rcna226676) reported, the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) released transcripts and audio recordings of the interview and — wouldn’t you know it? — Maxwell said exactly what the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) wanted to hear. “I never witnessed the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) in any inappropriate setting in any way. The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) was never inappropriate with anybody,” she said. “In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects.”

Given that Maxwell seems to be desperately looking for a [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) pardon, her comments were difficult to accept at face value. That said, for [House Judiciary Committee](http://judiciary.house.gov/) [Chairman](http://judiciary.house.gov/the-committee/the-chairman) [Jim Jordan (T-OH4)](https://jordan.house.gov/), it apparently wasn’t obvious at all.

“This confirms what we all knew,” [Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/) told [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) the day after the transcript was released. “We knew [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) didn’t do anything wrong here. He said that repeatedly. This transcript is the whole transcript, and it confirms that. So I think there’s nothing there, it seems, based on what we got from the interview of Ms. Maxwell.”

There are a couple of problems here.

The first is [Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/)’s eagerness to trust the word of a convicted sex trafficker who is looking for a pardon. I can appreciate why [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s sycophantic allies are eager to make the Epstein scandal go away, but to pretend that Maxwell has credibility and her claims should be accepted at face value is ridiculous.

The second problem is that [Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/) isn’t exactly the [Republican Party](https://www.gop.com/)’s best messenger on this issue. After all, as [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/powerful-gop-rep-jim-jordan-accused-turning-blind-eye-sexual-n888386) over the course of several years, the [right-wing congressman](https://jordan.house.gov/) was accused of [turning a blind eye to sexual misconduct](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/former-ohio-state-wrestlers-balk-jim-jordans-bid-speaker-rcna119891) targeting student athletes at [Ohio State](https://www.osu.edu/) during [Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/)’s tenure as an assistant coach.

The [congressman](https://jordan.house.gov/) has repeatedly said he didn’t know about the abuses, but given the nature of the controversy, maybe the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) should send out someone else to tout Maxwell’s claims in the Epstein scandal?
