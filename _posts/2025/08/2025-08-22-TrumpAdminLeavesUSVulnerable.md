## [Tulsi Gabbard to downsize national intelligence office, adding to broader offensive](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/tulsi-gabbard-downsize-national-intelligence-office-adding-broader-off-rcna226349)

*[Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s second term has clearly been challenging for U.S. intelligence agencies. It’s getting worse all the time.*

[Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s second term has clearly been challenging for U.S. intelligence agencies. It was just a few months ago, for example, when [the leaders of the National Intelligence Council were fired](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/gabbard-fires-wrong-intelligence-officials-wrong-time-wrong-reason-rcna206867) because they produced accurate information the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) didn’t like.

That coincided with reports of a [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) appointee trying to politicize intelligence, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s reluctance to participate in intelligence briefings, and the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s [recent decision to fire](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-purges-national-security-officials-destabilizing-team-rcna199673) the leadership of the [National Security Agency](https://www.nsa.gov/), a key intelligence gathering department, as well as the [National Security Council](https://www.whitehouse.gov/nsc/)’s director for intelligence.

And then, of course, there’s the downsizing. [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-russia-ukraine-texas-redistricting-dc-israel-gaza-live-updates-rcna225398/rcrd86833?canonicalCard=true):

> *[National Intelligence Director](https://www.odni.gov/) [Tulsi Gabbard](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) said today that her office will oversee a 40% reduction in ‘missions, functions and personnel’ by the end of the fiscal year, framing the move as an attempt to make the ‘bloated’ agency more ‘agile, effective and efficient.’ ... A news release indicated the cuts will save taxpayers more than \$700 million annually.*

[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) published a [related report](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/20/us/politics/gabbard-odni-reorganization.html) noting as part of the reorganization of [Gabbard](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence)’s team, the [Office of the Director of National Intelligence](https://www.odni.gov/) is “shrinking the [Foreign Malign Influence Center](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/ncsc-what-we-do/340-about/organization/foreign-malign-influence-center), which tracked efforts by adversarial countries to manipulate U.S. elections.”

The timing is remarkable: On the heels of [Gabbard](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) pushing [a bizarre conspiracy theory](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/pressed-evidence-conspiracy-theories-tulsi-gabbard-falls-embarrassingl-rcna223693) about [Russian](http://government.ru/) efforts to manipulate a U.S. election, the [DNI](https://www.odni.gov/) has decided the United States should deprioritize an intelligence office responsible for monitoring foreign adversaries targeting U.S. elections.

What’s more, [Gabbard](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence)’s announcement follows related efforts within the intelligence community, including an announcement about a “[major downsizing](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-house-invites-risks-major-downsizing-us-intelligence-agencies-rcna204855)” at the [CIA](https://www.cia.gov/).

[The Washington Post reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/05/02/cia-layoffs-trump-administration/) in May that current and former U.S. officials have warned of “a counterintelligence risk, noting that having thousands of potentially disgruntled intelligence personnel out of work presents a ripe recruiting target for adversary nations’ spy services.”

Even before [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was sworn in for his [first term](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/), he routinely and publicly [derided U.S. intelligence agencies](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-explains-skipped-intel-briefings-im-smart-person-msna935056), questioning their findings and value. Once in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)’s animosity toward his own country’s intelligence community seemed to intensify: [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has demonstrated an unfortunate habit of [belittling](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-isnt-quite-done-siding-putin-us-officials-rcna68330), [disregarding](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-reportedly-pays-sporadic-attention-intelligence-briefings-msna1258366), [contradicting](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/troubling-gaps-between-trumps-beliefs-and-intel-community-msna1174131) and occasionally even [feuding with](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-intensifies-insanely-dangerous-feud-intel-agencies-msna941291) U.S. spy agencies.

In his second term, he and his team appear to be going even further.
