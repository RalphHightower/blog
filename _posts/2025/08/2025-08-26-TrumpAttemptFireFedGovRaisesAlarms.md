Embattled [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) [Attorney General](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/) [Ken Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office) has been reported to have three homes listed as primary residences.

| Sept. 4, 2025, 3:15 p.m. EDT |
| [Pulte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pulte/) has framed the issue in black-and-white terms: “Your second home is not your primary home,” he warned in one recent post on X. |
| By that standard, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [labor secretary, Chavez-DeRemer](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/osec), could be in the wrong. In her financial disclosure form, she listed two mortgages on personal residences, both obtained in 2021. Mortgage records show her home is in [Happy Valley](https://www.happyvalleyor.gov/), a city near [Portland](https://www.portland.gov/) where [Chavez-DeRemer](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/osec) served as mayor before being elected to represent the area in the [U.S. House](https://www.house.gov/). She and her husband, [Shawn DeRemer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawn-m-deremer-md-80746073/), who leads an anesthesia company in Portland, refinanced their [longtime Oregon home](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26084993-chavez-deremer-oregon/?mode=document) in January 2021. Two months later, the couple bought a newly built house near a golf course in [Fountain Hills](https://www.fountainhillsaz.gov/), [Arizona](https://www.az.gov/). The pair had previously enjoyed vacationing in [Arizona](https://www.az.gov/), according to news reports and social media posts. [Labor](https://www.dol.gov/) [Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/osec) entered into two primary-residence mortgages in quick succession, including for a second home near a country club in Arizona, where she’s known to vacation. (In one incident that made the news, [Chavez-DeRemer](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/osec) was briefly hospitalized after a golf cart accident on her way back from watching a Sonoran Desert sunset.) The [mortgage agreement for the Arizona property](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26084992-chavez-deremer-arizona/) required them to occupy the home as their “principal residence” for at least a year, barring “extenuating circumstances” or the lender allowing them to violate the stipulation. |
| [Transportation](https://www.transportation.gov/) [Secretary Sean Duffy](https://www.transportation.gov/meet-secretary/us-transportation-secretary-sean-duffy) has primary-residence mortgages in [New Jersey](https://www.nj.gov/) and [Washington, D.C.](https://dc.gov/) |
| [Lee Zeldin](https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/epa-administrator), the [Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.epa.gov/) administrator, has one primary-residence mortgage in Long Island and another in [Washington, D.C.](https://dc.gov/), according to loan records. |

## [Why Trump’s offensive against the Fed’s Lisa Cook is a ‘five-alarm fire’](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-offensive-feds-lisa-cook-five-alarm-fire-rcna227188)

*At issue is an attempted White House power grab that ignores the rule of law and puts global economic stability at risk.*

Aug. 26, 2025, 8:49 AM EDT / Updated Aug. 26, 2025, 12:05 PM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

UPDATE (Aug. 26, 2025, 12:05 p.m. ET): [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) [Governor Lisa Cook](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/cook.htm)’s attorney, Abbe Lowell, [said Tuesday](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-removing-federal-reserve-governor-lisa-cook-rcna227138) that [Cook](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/cook.htm) will be filing a lawsuit, adding that [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s “attempt to fire her, based solely on a referral letter, lacks any factual or legal basis.”

Last Wednesday, [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) targeted [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) [Governor Lisa Cook](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/cook.htm), [writing online](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/team-trump-finds-something-new-weaponize-mortgage-fraud-allegations-rcna226381) that she “must resign, now!!!” A couple of days later, a reporter [asked the president](https://bsky.app/profile/thebulwark.com/post/3lwyp5uccwc2n) whether he intended to fire [Cook](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/cook.htm).

“Yeah, I’ll fire her if she doesn’t resign,” [the Republican replied](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-press-gaggle-peoples-house-august-22-2025/). “What she did was bad.”

Evidently, he was serious — at least about his intentions. [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-removing-federal-reserve-governor-lisa-cook-rcna227138):

> *[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is removing [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) [Governor Lisa Cook](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/cook.htm) effective immediately, according to a letter he posted to [Liars Club](https://truthsocial.com/) on Monday night. In the letter, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) writes: ‘Pursuant to my authority under [Article II](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/article-2/) of the [Constitution of the United States](https://constitution.congress.gov/) and the [Federal Reserve Act of 1913](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/fract.htmk), as amended, you are hereby removed from your position on the Board of Governors of the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/), effective immediately.’*

This is a story with a lot of moving parts, so let’s unpack the relevant details and review what we know.

**Who’s [Lisa Cook](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/cook.htm)?**

[Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) appointed [Cook](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/cook.htm), an accomplished economist, to the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/)’s board of governors three years ago, and at that point, she became the first Black woman to serve on the [Fed board](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/default.htm). Her tenure has been uncontroversial, at least until last week.

**Has she been accused of wrongdoing?**

Last week, the director of the [U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency](https://qaa.fhfa.gov/), [William Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte), alleged in a letter to [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) that [Cook](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/cook.htm) “potentially” committed mortgage fraud.

**Are the allegations credible?**

There’s reason for skepticism. [Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte/) is both a critic of the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) and a [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) loyalist — [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/), for example, [recently described](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/08/07/bill-pulte-trump-powell/) the [FHFA](https://www.fhfa.gov/) chief as “a prominent [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) sidekick” — who’s conveniently started [going after a variety of Trump targets](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/team-trump-finds-something-new-weaponize-mortgage-fraud-allegations-rcna226381?icid=latestpost_bot) with dubious claims of mortgage fraud.

**Has [Cook](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/cook.htm) been convicted of wrongdoing?**

No.

**Has [Cook](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/cook.htm) been indicted or formally charged with any crimes?**

No.

**Then how could [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) fire her?**

I’ll leave it to legal experts to answer the question with greater authority, but according to multiple accounts, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [cannot legally fire a Fed governor](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/22/us/politics/can-trump-fire-a-fed-governor.html) simply because he wants to.

As [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/) reported, “Under the [Federal Reserve Act](https://www.federalreserve.gov/), the only reason [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) governors can be removed from their positions is ‘for cause,’ or some kind of wrongdoing.” As things stand, [Cook](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/cook.htm) hasn’t even been charged, much less convicted, so [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s move appears to be illegal.

**Has the [U.S. Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) weighed in on the subject?**

As a matter of fact, it was just three months ago when [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)-appointed justices granted the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) considerable power to oust officials serving in independent agencies, but simultaneously, the high court explicitly said that the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) is a “uniquely structured, quasi-private entity.” That distinction appears to limit [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s powers over the Fed.

**Why would [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) be so eager to target the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) in the first place?**

Because the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) wants to seize control over U.S. monetary policy, especially as it relates to interest rates. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has already launched an unprecedented campaign against [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) [Chairman Jerome Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm), and if the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is able to force out [Cook](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/cook.htm) and replace her with someone who’ll do the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s bidding, it would gut the institution’s independence and shift power in the [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s direction.

**Why would that be dangerous?**

Because, as [Paul Krugman explained](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/-five-alarm-fire-trump-attempts-to-fire-fed-board-member-inviting-economic-calamity-245761605801), the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) is responsible for everything from interest rates to bank supervision to avoiding systemic financial crises. If [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) successfully corrupts the institution and its work, Krugman said, “We become [Venezuela](https://gob.ve/). We become [Turkey](https://www.turkiye.gov.tr/). We become a place where all of this stuff is just at the whims of the strongman in charge. ... No [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) should have the power to just arbitrarily control what the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) does, and least of all this president. So, this is the road to things going completely wild — not five years down the pike, but months from now.”

He added, “This is a five-alarm fire.”

**It sounds like this is about [Cook](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/cook.htm), but it’s not just about [Cook](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/cook.htm).**

What we’re talking about is an attempted [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov=) power grab, launched by an authoritarian [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), that ignores the rule of law and puts global economic stability at risk.

**Why “attempted”? Did [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) fire [Cook](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/cook.htm) or didn’t he?**

The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) claims to have fired the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) [governor](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/cook.htm), but [Cook](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/cook.htm)’s attorney described the move as “[illegal](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/08/25/us/trump-news/9fdf9b34-1cc2-507e-99d1-f4c7b1278b9a?smid=url-share),” and [Cook](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/cook.htm) [issued a statement](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/08/25/us/trump-news/9fe379c1-8b1d-5cf5-8856-78577e01f172?smid=url-share) suggesting that, as far as she’s concerned, she hasn’t been fired.

**Anything else?**

“The message here clearly isn’t ‘Don’t commit fraud,’ which would be laughable coming from [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), of all people,” [Krugman wrote](https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/we-are-all-lisa-cook?publication_id=277517&post_id=171826668&isFreemail=true&r=2231v&triedRedirect=true&). “Nor, despite what some commentators have said, is it all about revenge — although [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is, indeed, a remarkably vindictive person. But mainly it’s about intimidation: ‘If you get in our way we will ruin your life.’”
