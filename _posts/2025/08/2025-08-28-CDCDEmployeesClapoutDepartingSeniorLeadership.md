> Aug 29, 2025
> Supporters lined up along the sidewalk across the street from [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/) headquarters in Decatur to cheer for three doctors who resigned from the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/) this week

Hundreds of employees and supporters of the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/) lined the sidewalks outside the agency’s Atlanta headquarters Thursday for a “clap out” rally to honor three senior leaders who resigned a day earlier in protest of [Health and Human Services](https://www.hhs.gov/,) [Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) anti-vaccine attacks on the agency and public health at large.

Dr. Deb Houry, former deputy director and chief medical officer; Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, former director of the [National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD)](https://www.cdc.gov/about/leadership/ncird.html); and Dr. Daniel Jernigan, former director of the [National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID)](https://www.cdc.gov/about/leadership/ncezid.html), walked through the crowd, hugging former colleagues and accepting bouquets of flowers.

They resigned Wednesday after [HHS](https://www.hhs.gov/) announced that [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) [had fired](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/cdc-rfk-jr-senior-leaders-resignations-susan-monarez-rcna227717) [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/,) Director Susan Monarez, who had been in her post for less than a month. Monarez’s lawyers disputed her firing, saying that only the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) had the authority to fire her and claiming that she had been [pushed out for refusing](https://x.com/MarkSZaidEsq/status/1960842941293060446) “to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts.”

[Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) [defended the firing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cCnf8mIg5A&ab_channel=FoxNews) Thursday on [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/), citing a nonspecific “deeply embedded malaise at the agency.”

According to [reporting in the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/08/28/cdc-director-jim-oneill/), the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has tapped [HHS](https://www.hhs.gov/) deputy secretary Jim O’Neill to serve as Monarez’s interim replacement. O’Neill, who the [Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) calls a ["close ally"](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/30/1119449/hhs-robert-f-kennedy-jr-jim-oneill-longevity-maha/) of tech investor Peter Thiel, criticized the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/) during the pandemic, but has not echoed [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html)’s attacks on vaccines. He is expected to lead the agency while continuing to advise [HHS](https://www.hhs.gov/).

Houry, Daskalakis and Jernigan — who were escorted off the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/)’s Atlanta campus by security earlier Thursday — gave impromptu speeches in support of their former agency, promising they would continue to fight from the outside.

“We agreed to do this together,” [Houry told a reporter at the rally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ7QvPHjKRU) at the rally about their coordinated resignations. “If one of us resigned, it would have been a blip. When the three of us do it together, it’s more powerful, and it just shows the state of our agency.”

“We need [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) to intervene,” Houry said. “I hope this is the tipping point.”

Some in [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) are listening. Sen. [Bill Cassidy, (T-LA)](https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/), a doctor who chairs the Senate’s health committee and whom Monarez [reportedly contacted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/08/27/susan-monarez-cdc-director-ousted/) Monday with concerns about [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html)’s demands, [called for “oversight”](https://x.com/SenBillCassidy](https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/)/status/1960895774079799344) Wednesday night. On Thursday, he said an upcoming vaccine advisory meeting should be canceled. “If the meeting proceeds, any recommendations made should be rejected as lacking legitimacy given the seriousness of the allegations and the current turmoil in [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/) leadership,” [Cassidy](https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/), who was instrumental in approving [Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html)’s nomination, said [in a statement](https://www.help.senate.gov/rep/newsroom/press/cassidy-calls-for-vaccine-committee-meeting-to-be-postponed-following-cdc-departures).

[Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Bernie Sanders (I-VT)](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/) the ranking member of the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [health committee](http://www.help.senate.gov/), also [called for a bipartisan investigation](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/news-sanders-demands-bipartisan-investigation-into-firing-of-cdc-director/) into Monarez’s firing.
