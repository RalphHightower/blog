## [Jan. 6 revelations about Trump’s labor statistics nominee create new test for GOP senators](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jan-6-revelations-trumps-labor-statistics-nominee-create-new-test-gop-rcna224959)

[E.J. Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd)’s nomination to lead the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/) was already dreadful. New reporting on his Jan. 6 connection makes it vastly worse.*

Aug. 14, 2025, 8:47 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

It’s been two weeks since [poor job numbers](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/us-job-growth-turns-cold-trumps-agenda-takes-toll-economy-rcna222448) forced [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to confront evidence of his own failures. Presented with data showing job growth in the United States slowing to [a 16-year low](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/us-job-growth-turns-cold-trumps-agenda-takes-toll-economy-rcna222448), the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [fired Erica McEntarfer, the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-responds-failure-create-jobs-firing-us-labor-statistics-chief-rcna222532), the head of the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/) without cause.

The question that followed wasn’t whether the Republican would choose an awful successor to the [highly qualified and widely respected BLS chief](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-responds-failure-create-jobs-firing-us-labor-statistics-chief-rcna222532), but rather, how awful his new nominee would be.

As it turns out, we didn’t have to wait too long to find out.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) this week nominated [E.J. Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd), the chief economist at the [Heritage Foundation](https://www.heritage.org/), a conservative group that used to have a reputation as a prominent think tank. Almost immediately, [Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd) was exposed as an almost cartoonishly poor choice. His [academic background](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/ej-antoni-who-bls-44f73217?mod=hp_lead_pos1), for example, leaves little doubt that he’s spectacularly unqualified to lead the bureau.

But there’s no need to stop there. [Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd) has a record of [misunderstanding the same government data](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/12/business/trump-bls-ej-antoni.html) that he’s supposed to oversee. He’s signaled an interest in [moving away from](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/cooking-books-hiding-books-team-trump-puts-access-jobs-data-doubt-rcna224693) releasing monthly job reports. He’s [derided Social Security](https://www.mediamatters.org/social-security/trumps-bls-commissioner-nominee-ej-antoni-calls-social-security-ponzi-scheme) as a “Ponzi scheme.” He’s been [mocked](https://x.com/GaryWinslett/status/1955074525546053778) by his contemporaries as “a joke.”

And just when it seemed [Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd)’s record couldn’t get much worse, [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/trump-bureau-labor-statistics-nominee-ej-antoni-jan-6-bystander-rcna224645):

> *[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s pick to run the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/) was among the crowd outside the [Capitol](https://www.uscp.gov/) on [Jan. 6, 2021]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}), with the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) saying he was a ‘bystander’ who wandered over after seeing coverage on the news. ... [Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd) appears in numerous videos posted on social media of the crowd on the [Capitol](https://www.uscp.gov/) grounds.*

In fairness, it’s important to emphasize that there’s no evidence of [Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd) ever violently clashing with police officers or entering the [U.S. Capitol](https://www.uscp.gov/) building. He also wasn’t charged with any crimes related to the insurrectionist attack. In fact, the [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/) report added, “The footage shows [Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd) approximately an hour after the mob removed police barricades. The footage appears to show him leaving the grounds as people entered the [Capitol](https://www.uscp.gov/) and not entering the building.”

But there was a [Jan. 6 mob]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}), and the [BLS](https://www.bls.gov/) nominee was clearly part of the crowd.

In a normal and healthy political environment, the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) would respond to developments like these by quietly pulling [Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd)’s nomination. That appears unlikely: Given [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) is comfortable [hiring a Jan. 6 rioter who was filmed urging the mob to “kill” police officers](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/new-video-shows-justice-dept-official-urging-jan-6-rioters-kill-police-rcna223826), it’s difficult to believe that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) will be bothered by [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/)’ revelation.

But [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s opinion isn’t the only one that matters.

The head of the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/) is a [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/)-confirmed position, and [Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd) almost certainly won’t receive any [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) support. Assuming that’s the case, [Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd)’s nomination will fall short if just four [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) balk.

This might seem unrealistic, especially given [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) senators’ recent propensity for rubber-stamping other wildly unqualified nominees sent over by the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). But [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Thom Tillis (T-NC)](https://www.tillis.senate.gov/), who’ll retire from [Capitol](https://www.uscp.gov/) Hill next year, has [suggested that Jan. 6 is a deal-breaker for him](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/07/09/congress/tillis-has-a-warning-for-trump-00445968).

If [Tillis](https://www.tillis.senate.gov/) sticks to that position — and [senators](https://www.senate.gov/) such as [Susan Collins (T-ME)](https://www.collins.senate.gov/) and [Lisa Murkowski (T-AK)](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/) give this nomination a serious look — [Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd)’s confirmation might not be a foregone conclusion. Watch this space.
