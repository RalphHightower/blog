## [DOJ admits how little Epstein-Maxwell grand jury transcripts reveal in latest court filing](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/jeffrey-epstein-ghislaine-maxwell-grand-jury-transcripts-rcna223103)

*The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) conceded much of the grand jury information is already public. So why is it doing this?*

Aug. 5, 2025, 11:41 AM EDT
By [Jordan Rubin](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jordan-rubin-ncpn1301611)

When the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) moved to unseal grand jury transcripts in the Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell cases, it seemed the transcripts [wouldn’t reveal much.](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/ghislaine-maxwell-jeffery-epstein-grand-jury-transcripts-rcna221911). Those documents likely offer nothing approaching the full scope of information contained in all of the government’s files related to the sex trafficking conspiracy that has [embroiled President Donald Trump’s second term](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/08/01/trump-epstein-decisions-ankush-khardori-column-00484918) as his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) refuses to release all the information it possesses as promised.

The [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/)’s latest court filing in the matter reinforces the limited nature of what these transcripts would reveal if the government is successful in its pending motion to unseal.

While noting that certain information in the transcripts is not publicly available (as far as the government knows), the filing said that “much of the information provided during the course of the grand jury testimony — with the exception of the identities of certain victims and witnesses — was made publicly available at trial or has otherwise been publicly reported through the public statements of victims and witnesses.”

If the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) is correct about the limited nature of the revelations it’s seeking, then it’s unclear why it’s seeking them. This endeavor could hardly be called a distraction. Rather, it keeps attention on a story the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [doesn’t want to talk about](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/now-trump-says-forget-jeffrey-epstein-9ca7d378), in a stated attempt to release information that is unlikely to make the story go away, because it won’t address all the other information the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) is keeping under wraps. Releasing the limited information in the grand jury transcripts would only re-raise the questions: What else is there, and why is the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) hiding it?

Crucially, not only is it an effort that could bear little, if any, valuable information, but it also comes at a potentially great cost to victims. They don’t seem to have been prioritized in an effort that’s apparently driven by protecting the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), whose resistance to full transparency has put greater focus on [his own relationship with Epstein](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/wall-street-journal-trump-epstein-lawsuit-rcna219968), who died by suicide in 2019 while being held on trafficking charges. It took pointed questioning from the judiciary for the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) to [effectively concede](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/ghislaine-maxwell-jeffery-epstein-grand-jury-transcripts-rcna221911) that it hadn’t even notified victims of its unsealing attempt until prompted by the courts to do so.

Taking a step back, the unsealing litigation continues as the government just moved Maxwell to a minimum-security facility, [after she met with](https://www.npr.org/2025/07/29/nx-s1-5484129/todd-blanche-epstein-ghislaine-maxwell-trump) [Deputy](https://www.justice.gov/dag/) [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Todd Blanche](https://www.justice.gov/dag/), who was previously [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s personal criminal defense lawyer. It’s unclear what they discussed or why officials then moved her to a seemingly more comfortable living situation while she serves a 20-year sentence for conspiring with Epstein to sexually abuse minors. Otherwise set for release in 2037, she has a [pending Supreme Court appeal](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/ghislaine-maxwell-testimony-congress-supreme-court-rcna222852), and her lawyers have said she would testify to [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) [if Trump grants her clemency](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/ghislaine-maxwell-pardon-congress-testimony-rcna221803).

Like the unsealing effort, it’s unclear how pardoning Maxwell or commuting her sentence would help [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) politically, either — all while highlighting th[e [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s apparent indifference to Epstein and Maxwell’s victims.
