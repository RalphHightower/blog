## [Trump's redistricting scheme is dirty. Democrats are ready to stoop to his level.](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-texas-redistricting-democrats-california-newsom-hochul-rcna223530)

*[Gavin Newsom](https://www.gov.ca.gov/about/) and [Kathy Hochul](https://www.governor.ny.gov/) are looking at potentially risky plans to counter [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/)' radical redistricting scheme.*

Aug. 8, 2025, 6:00 AM EDT
By Zeeshan Aleem, [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) Opinion Writer/Editor

California [Gov. Gavin Newsom and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul are crafting plans](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2026-election/democrats-plans-redistricting-retaliate-texas-republicans-legal-rcna223128) to fight back against [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s push for [a radical gerrymandering scheme in Texas](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-texas-redistricting-map-congress-voters-rcna223094), which would help rig the 2026 midterm elections in favor of the GOP.

This sign of resistance from the [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) establishment means [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) appear to be warming up to the idea of fighting dirty to beat back [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s exploitive agenda. But it’s also making clear that matching [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s energy could easily push democratic norms in the country backward for everyone.

> *If [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) decide to go tit-for-tat with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) on redistricting, it could be polarizing, but they wouldn’t be accused of being soft.*

[This summer](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/09/us/politics/trump-texas-redistricting.html) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [pressured](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/02/us/politics/texas-redistricting-democrats-republicans-midterms.html) [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) [Gov.](https://gov.texas.gov/) [Greg Abbott](https://gov.texas.gov/governor-abbott) and [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/)’ [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) state legislators to redraw congressional district lines to make it easier to secure new [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) seats in the state. [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) obeyed. As [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/02/us/politics/texas-redistricting-democrats-republicans-midterms.html), [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) lawmakers released a draft map last week that “all but erased three urban [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) seats and forced two other incumbents in South [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) into more [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) terrain.” [Abbott](https://gov.texas.gov/governor-abbott) called a special session of the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) to vote the map into law, but [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) lawmakers [fled the state to deny the Legislature a quorum](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/texas-democrats-leave-state-hope-derail-republicans-radical-redistrict-rcna222836) and freeze the process.

Partisan gerrymandering — drawing up districts to give an advantage to one party — is, unfortunately, normal across many states. But the specific kind of gerrymandering that [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) is pursuing at [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s beckoning is different. Typically states redraw their districts at the beginning of every decade after the [U.S. census](https://www.census.gov/) provides new population data — and [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) already gerrymandered its districts at the beginning of the decade. As UCLA law professor Richard Hasen [wrote for MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-texas-redistricting-map-congress-voters-rcna223094), this effort at an additional mid-decade gerrymandering effort is a naked power grab: “The [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) sent [a laughably weak letter](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5371287) to [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) claiming that the state had to redistrict because its earlier redistricting plans were unconstitutional racial gerrymanders,” he wrote. That in turn gave it a convenient pretext to try to manufacture five new seats for the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) ahead of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s midterms.

Now [Newsom](https://www.gov.ca.gov/about/) and [Hochul](https://www.governor.ny.gov/) are threatening to retaliate with their own partisan gerrymandering agendas to offset [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/)’ political scheme. “I’m tired of fighting this fight with my hand tied behind my back,” [Hochul](https://www.governor.ny.gov/) [said this week](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/new-york-playbook-pm/2025/08/04/hochul-tells-dems-to-play-dirty-00492129). But their plans aren’t simple, and they come with tradeoffs.

Unlike [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/), [California](https://www.ca.gov/) has an independent redistricting commission, which is a bipartisan panel designed explicitly to block partisan gerrymandering. That means [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) would have to find a way to circumvent the commission to try to offset [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) with his own partisan gerrymandering. Here’s how that would work, according to [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/):

> *[Newsom](https://www.gov.ca.gov/about/) hopes to work with the [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/)-dominated Legislature starting this month to set up a special election for a statewide ballot measure on Nov. 4. It would offer a newly drawn map if [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) moves forward, a source close to [Newsom](https://www.gov.ca.gov/about/) told [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/). The ballot measure would do two things: First, it would affirm support for [Abbott](https://gov.texas.gov/governor-abbott)’s independent commission and call for fair redistricting nationwide. Second, it would include a trigger that says a pre-drawn new [House](https:/%www.house.gov/) map expected to boost [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) would take effect if [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) implemented a new map.*

That’s a heavy lift, both politically and procedurally speaking. In a special election [Newsom](https://www.gov.ca.gov/about/) would have to convince [Californians](https://www.ca.gov/) that he opposes partisan gerrymandering — but deserves the authority to do it anyway as a defensive political measure. And as [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/) reports, “any new [House](https://www.house.gov/) map would be constrained by the Voting Rights Act, as well as the governor’s office and the Legislature, which would need to greenlight it.”

Former [Californians](https://www.ca.gov/) [Gov.](https://www.gov.ca.gov/) Arnold Schwarzenegger, who oversaw the state constitutional amendments that put the independent commission into place, [said he’ll fight Newsom’s measure](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/04/schwarzenegger-newsom-redistricting-00493418). Some of the state’s [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) [seem skeptical](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/17/california-newsom-texas-voter-maps) of [Newsom](https://www.gov.ca.gov/about/)’s plan. He [could face legal challenges](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/17/california-newsom-texas-voter-maps) over [the effort](https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/07/gavin-newsom-redistricting/).

[Hochul](https://www.governor.ny.gov/)’s effort would be likely to take more time — and take effect after the midterms. [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) also has its own independent redistricting commission, and [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/) reports that “changing the [redistricting process](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2026-election/new-york-democrats-unveil-decade-redistricting-scheme-targeting-future-rcna221811) must move forward as a legislatively referred constitutional amendment — a lengthy and arduous exercise that probably wouldn’t lead to new congressional maps until the 2028 election cycle, even if [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) acts before the upcoming midterms.”

Some other [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) governors, including [JB Pritzker](https://gov.illinois.gov/about/the-governor.html) of [Illinois](https://www.illinois.gov/), haven’t ruled out their own retaliatory gerrymandering efforts.

[Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) voters have been [expressing sharp disapproval](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/democrats-polls-approval-trump-schumer-rcna193431) of [their own](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/jb-pritzker-gerrymandering-illinois-trump-b2802719.html) party for its meekness in the face of [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) extremism, and clamoring for a party willing to fight more fiercely to protect democracy. Retaliatory gerrymandering would seem, on one level, to fit the bill. [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) have generally insisted on adhering to norms and [declined to use every procedural tool at their disposal](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/senate-democrats-rules-trump-agenda-filibuster-rcna192147) to slow down the [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) in [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/). If [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) decide to go tit-for-tat with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) on redistricting, it could be polarizing, but they wouldn’t be accused of being soft.

At the same time, there’s no way for [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) to avoid losing something in the process. It’s awkward to fight for democracy while simultaneously mirroring [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s efforts to effectively disenfranchise voters. A group can champion principles most credibly by holding on to them, even when they’re inconvenient. And it’s not even clear that such efforts would be politically “necessary”: historical trends suggest [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) could have a wave election in 2026, and, as Hasen notes, [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/)’ redistricting ambitions could also backfire by diluting some [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) districts. The [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) plan is insidious — but it’s not guaranteed to work.

The reality is there is no good option for [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/). Unilaterally disarming against [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) as he pursues an autocratic agenda could be disastrous. But mimicking his antics also comes with costs and political risks, and could unravel valuable long-term efforts across many states to support independent redistricting. The conundrum speaks to the corrosive effect of living under a [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) who thinks rules are meant to be broken.
