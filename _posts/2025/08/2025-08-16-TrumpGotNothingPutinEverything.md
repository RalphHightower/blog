## [The Trump-Putin Alaska summit seemed to do more for Russia than the U.S.](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-putin-pursuing-peace-summit-alaska-rcna225311)

*Ahead of the leaders' historic summit, the  dramatically lowered the expectations that any ceasefire or peace settlement would be reached.*

Aug. 16, 2025, 6:00 AM EDT
By Nayyera Haq, assistant dean at Syracuse Maxwell School of Public Affairs and MSNBC Columnist

Last week, [the [White House blew past its own deadline of imposing sanctions on Russia(https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/instead-imposing-sanctions-trump-finds-new-ways-give-putin-wants-rcna224235) for continuing its three-year invasion of [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/), and then, in a misguided effort to clean up that mistake, [President Donald Trump gifted Russian President Vladimir Putin](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-handed-putin-win-alaska-even-shook-hands-rcna225278) a one-on-one meeting in [Alaska](https://www.alaska.gov/). [It was impossible to make sense of what Trump expected to gain](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-putin-summit-russia-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-rcna224593) by doing so. It’s not even clear what [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wants, [other than a Nobel Peace Prize](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/nobel-peace-prize-donald-trump-rcna225248).

> *[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said he and [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/) had decided not to try for a ceasefire at all, "which often times do not hold up."*

It’s even less apparent now what [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wanted and expected. But after [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/) met for more than two hours Friday, and then praised each other to the media for about 12 minutes, it was clear that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), in his rush to meet with [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/), not only risked whatever was left of his image as a dealmaker-in-chief, but he also may have damaged the United States’ image as a global champion for democracy.

Did the meeting bring us any closer to a peace agreement between [Russia](http://government.ru/) and [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/)? [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said the two countries “haven’t quite gotten there” but “made some headway” and then landed on the tried-and-true holding statement that “there’s no deal until there’s a deal.”

He said, “I will call up [NATO](https://www.nato.int/) in a little while. I will call up the various people that I think are appropriate. And I’ll, of course, call up [President Zelenskyy](https://www.president.gov.ua/) and tell him about today’s meeting. It’s ultimately up to them.”

Then, early on Saturday, a [few more details were released](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)/posts/115037569702889410). [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said he and [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/) had decided not to try for a ceasefire at all, "which often times do not hold up," but instead work directly on a peace agreement. [Zelenskyy confirmed](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-putin-summit-live-updates-ukraines-volodymyr-zelenskyy-visit-tru-rcna225334) he would visit [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) in Washington to discuss that possibility on Monday. But the end result of Friday's meeting remains unchanged.

Notably, before the summit, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) had upset [Zelenskyy](https://www.president.gov.ua/) and Europe when he said, with no input from [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/), that in a ceasefire deal “[there’ll be some swapping of territories](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/lindsey-graham-says-russia-ukraine-need-swap-land-ceasefire-deal-rcna224140) to the betterment of both.” [Russia](http://government.ru/) elaborated that it anticipated getting [control of all of eastern Ukraine](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/14/world/mapping-key-regions-ukraine-intl-vis). At the same time, the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) team planned to move ahead with revoking the legal statuses of [more than 200,000 Ukrainian refugees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpZUQpZcXog) living in the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/).

While even anodyne meetings between friendly heads of state are typically highly choreographed, with goals and discussion boundaries outlined well in advance by other officials, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s freewheeling style and misplaced confidence that he has a personal relationship with [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/), a former KGB officer, created an unnecessary level of unpredictability to the proceedings in the days leading up to the so-called “Pursuing Peace” event.

“If you roll into the meeting not prepped, you can get jammed by [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/),” Michael McFaul, who was U.S. ambassador to [Russia](http://government.ru/) in the [Obama administration](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/), said last week. “Summits are to achieve an objective that advances American national interests. They’re the means to end, and I sometimes feel that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) feels the meeting is an end in itself.”

> *[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s misplaced confidence that he has a personal relationship with [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/), a former KGB officer, created an unnecessary level of unpredictability to the proceedings.*

When it appeared that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was going to walk into that meeting with [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/) and offer him part of [Ukraine](https://www.gov.ua/) on a platter, other countries took up the pro-democracy mantle the U.S. had dropped. The [European Union](https://european-union.europa.eu/) objected to the concept of appeasing invaders who ignore national boundaries, an experience Europeans are keen to avoid after the infamous 1938 meeting that preceded World War II. Also, after a virtual meeting with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and other leaders, [French](https://www.info.gouv.fr/) [President(https://www.elysee.fr/) [Emmanuel Macron](https://www.elysee.fr/emmanuel-macron) affirmed that “the territorial issue relating to Ukraine [cannot and will not be negotiated by anyone but the Ukrainian president](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-presidency-putin-ukraine-summit-08-13-25).” But [Macron](https://www.elysee.fr/emmanuel-macron) maintained that something needed to come out of this meeting, such as a ceasefire and a return of kidnapped [Ukrainian children](https://www.gov.ua/).

The pressure on [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to actually consider the details and impacts of his statements worked — at least to a degree. The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) dramatically lowered the expectations that any ceasefire or peace settlement would be reached by referring to the summit as “a listening session,” during which [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) would simply tell [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/), “You’ve got to end this war.” Shortly before the meeting began, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) also stated he is “[open to the possibility of security guarantees](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/08/15/trump-putin-ukraine-summit-alaska/)” for Ukraine, though how that can be managed without membership in [NATO](https://www.nato.int/) — the multinational entity holding the line against [Russian](http://government.ru/) aggression — remains to be seen.

At the beginning of the meeting, there was a palpable sigh of relief from European allies as the real-time decision was made for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/) to [meet alongside their senior diplomats](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/live-blog/trump-putin-summit-alaska-ukraine-war-russia-peace-live-updates-rcna224983). This at least guaranteed that there’d be some level of note-taking, that American officials would have basic insight into the discussions and that the world would not be left to rely solely on the [Russian](http://government.ru/) spin of the events. The idea of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) meeting [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/) without those parameters in place wouldn’t have been a worry if [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) hadn’t had secret meetings with [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/) in the past [where no one else knows what really happened](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-prepares-latest-summit-putin-dont-forget-last-one-rcna225031).

But [Russia](http://government.ru/) clearly felt like it could flex its muscle even heading into this meeting. The [Russian](http://government.ru/) foreign minister arrived in the U.S. [wearing a CCCP sweatshirt,](https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/08/15/lavrov-ussr-russia-trump-putin-ukraine-summit-alaska/), something he has not done before. [Russian](http://government.ru/) officials began telling media outlets [they anticipated getting mineral rights in Alaska](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-putin-alaska-minerals-meeting-2114087).

While the [Russian](http://government.ru/) energy sector and economy is suffering, the truth is [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/) didn’t need anything more than a photo of him on the same military base the U.S. once used to counter the Soviets. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) legitimized [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/) as the leader of a superpower that must be dealt with directly and not a rogue state kicked out of the G8. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) completely ignored U.S. sanctions and the international arrest warrant for [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/), essentially siding with [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/) against the democratic world order. He again illustrated how potentially easy it is for him to be manipulated into playing second fiddle to [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/)’s imperial ambitions, gaining nothing for himself or the U.S. in return.

> *The [Russian](http://government.ru/) foreign minister arrived in the U.S. wearing a CCCP sweatshirt.*

After 20 minutes of speaking in [Russian](http://government.ru/) to the mostly American media, [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/), who speaks English well enough, closed out his time in Alaska by saying: “Next time, in [Moscow](http://kremlin.ru/).”

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/)’s remark would get him “a little heat,” but that he “could see it possibly happening.”

[Putin](http://kremlin.ru/) naming [Moscow](http://kremlin.ru/) as the site of a follow-up meeting is another way way of proclaiming that [Russia](http://government.ru/) is back in the great power game.

Thanks to the president who wants us to believe he’s the world’s best negotiator and maker of deals.
