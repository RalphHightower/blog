title: 'JD “John Boy” Vance Wants Full Transparency on Epstein Files. Oops! Trump Wants to Bury Files'
---

## [JD Vance accidentally made a strong case for releasing the Epstein files](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-epstein-files-trump-biden-attention-rcna224323)

*The [vice president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/)'s defense of the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)'s about-face on the Epstein files doesn't make sense.*

By Zeeshan Aleem, MSNBC Opinion Writer/Editor

The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has been [desperate to find a way to distract its own base](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/analysis/trump-epstein-files-distraction-fox-news-russiagate-rcna223977) from its demand for a [a full release of the Epstein files.](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-epstein-files-democrats-response-rcna218675). But instead of distracting the base, Vice President [JD Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/)’s new attempted “whataboutism” diversion tactic will likely attract more attention to the issue. It’s a hilarious own goal that seems guaranteed to keep the issue top of mind for activists.

“I laugh at the [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)s who are now all of a sudden so interested in the Epstein files,” [Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) said in an interview with [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) host [Maria Bartiromo](https://www.foxnews.com/person/b/maria-bartiromo) on Sunday. “For four years, [Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) and the [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) did absolutely nothing about this story. We know that Jeffrey Epstein had a lot of connections with left-wing politicians and left-wing billionaires. And now [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has demanded full transparency from this, and yet somehow the [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) are attacking him, and not the [Biden administration](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/), which did nothing for four years.”

*[Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) is only making the case for releasing the Epstein files stronger.*

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has of course not been demanding “full transparency.” His [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has instead [flipped its position](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-epstein-files-democrats-response-rcna218675) on releasing all the Epstein-related documents it once claimed it had. On top of that, [Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/)’s timeline is off. Epstein died by suicide in 2019 — when [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), not [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/), had the first opportunity to obtain and share new information about Epstein’s death and his social circles. And it was [Trump’s Department of Justice that gave Epstein a so-called “sweetheart deal.”](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/congress-doesnt-want-talk-alex-acosta-epsteins-sweetheart-deal-maker-rcna223543)

But on top of that, [Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) is only making the case for releasing the Epstein files stronger. He’s saying [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)s have more to fear because Epstein had well-documented social connections to liberals, [including former President Bill Clinton.](https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/trump/2025/02/28/epstein-flight-logs-list-surprising-details-trump-clinton-trips/80730076007/) Well, that’s precisely why so many [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) supporters want to see the files.

The allure of the Epstein files, for those most interested in them, is the conviction that Epstein’s social scene reveals a secret world of elite exploitation and impunity that spans the political spectrum. And insofar as the rumors about Epstein track [with the (preposterous) QAnon conspiracy theory,](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/how-qanon-helps-its-followers-find-conspiracy-chaos-n1262227) its proponents believe that politicians and plutocrats on the left side of the spectrum stand to lose the most. [Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/)’s suggestion that the files could contain juicy stuff on [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)s, therefore, isn’t going to mollify those demanding their release. They already believe that. And so [Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/)’s remarks may only intensify their demands for their release.

The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s deflections and denials might be effective if criticism of its handling of this matter were only a [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) line of attack. But a huge segment of [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) care about the issue. A [Reuters-Ipsos poll](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-faces-backlash-69-believe-epstein-details-concealed-reutersipsos-poll-2025-07-17/) from mid-July found that about a third of [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) disapproved of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s handling of the issue and that 62% believed that the government was hiding information on Epstein’s client list. That poll also found that 82% of [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)s disapproved of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s handling of the issue, and that the same percentage believed the government was hiding information on Epstein’s client list.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s “nothing to see here” narrative isn’t helped by the slow drip of reporting illuminating [the depth of Trump’s relationship](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/epstein-trump-wall-street-journal-letter-rcna219501). The [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/), citing senior [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) officials, [reported](https://www.wsj.com/politics/justice-department-told-trump-name-in-epstein-files-727a8038?mod=hp_lead_pos1) in July that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s name appears in the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/)’s files on Epstein multiple times. Even if [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) were implicated in some way by a full release of files, it’s not clear how much, if any, of his diehard base would leave his side. But [his desperation to change the topic](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/analysis/trump-epstein-files-distraction-fox-news-russiagate-rcna223977) is easy to observe.

[As I’ve noted earlier](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-epstein-files-democrats-response-rcna218675), the [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)ic attacks on [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) are not the same as MAGA’s. Their argument is not that the Epstein files contain some obvious smoking gun that will benefit them politically. They’re calling out [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) his allies out for promising to release the Epstein files and boasting that the Epstein client list was allegedly sitting on the attorney general’s desk, and then saying there was no list. The more desperate the excuses from [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), the more it looks like he — not [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)s — has something to hide.
