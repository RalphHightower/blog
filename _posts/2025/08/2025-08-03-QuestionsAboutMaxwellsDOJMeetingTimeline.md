On Friday, lawyers for [Ghislaine Maxwell,](https://www.msnbc.com/weekends-with-alex-witt/watch/a-pardon-for-ghislaine-maxwell-would-devastate-epstein-survivors-investigative-news-editor-243890245944), longtime associate of the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, confirmed that she had been [moved](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/ghislaine-maxwell-moved-federal-prison-texas-rcna222497) from a [low-security facility in Tallahassee, Florida](https://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/tal/), to a [minimum-security federal prison camp in Texas](https://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/bry/).

Maxwell's move came amid renewed attention on the so-called Epstein files, with [Donald Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/donald-trump) facing intense scrutiny over his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s handling of the matter. It also comes a week after she sat down with [Deputy](https://www.justice.gov/dag/) [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/,) [Todd Blanche](https://www.justice.gov/dag/) for [nine hours over two days](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/ghislaine-maxwell-justice-department-meetings-rcna221240) in [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/).

Before Maxwell’s arrival in [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) was reported, MSNBC legal correspondent Lisa Rubin was asked about the interactions between Maxwell and the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) on Thursday’s [“Deadline: White House,”](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house) and called the timeline “curious.”

Rubin recounted that before that late July meeting between [Blanche](https://www.justice.gov/dag/) and Maxwell, the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/,), through [Solicitor General](https://www.justice.gov/osg) [D. John Sauer](https://www.justice.gov/osg/staff-profile/solicitor-general-john-sauer), submitted a brief to the [Supreme Court]() arguing Maxwell’s conviction should stand. (Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022 after being convicted of sex-trafficking-related crimes.) In that July 14 filing, [Sauer](https://www.justice.gov/osg/staff-profile/solicitor-general-john-sauer) shot down Maxwell’s claim that she was protected from prosecution due to Epstein’s 2007 plea agreement in [Florida](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).

But the following day, Rubin recalled, on July 15, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was [contacted by reporters](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-sues-wall-street-journals-publisher-reporters-epstein-article-rcna219703) from [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/trump-jeffrey-epstein-birthday-letter-we-have-certain-things-in-common-f918d796?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAhrzZRJZRGwT2DXijaxE1QzUDuA_iuYinQNm2xTWBReWcxLu_vncHMR4wwnL4s%3D&gaa_ts=688cffa4&gaa_sig=fg7Ua6lzHc1yHe6MZEkLXpUutU30YwpHWYCpJsiO23VoFjDyNNas8KhlGq57OkJ2nUnEfyKAi10njA0PDmg3Eg%3D%3D) about an alleged birthday card he had written to Epstein in 2003. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has denied the [Journal](https://www.wsj.com/)’s reporting, but the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) was inundated with questions about the details of his relationship with Epstein.

One week later, [Blanche](https://www.justice.gov/dag/) [posted to social media](https://x.com/DAGToddBlanche](https://www.justice.gov/dag/)/status/1947623916538617946) that the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) would reach out to Maxwell for an interview, and later that week, he met with her in [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/).

Rubin noted that the government had “two days of conversations with her, not in the federal prison where she’s serving time, but in a [U.S. Attorney’s Office](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndfl), so she theoretically could be more comfortable during those conversations.”

While we know that the meeting took place, Rubin stressed that many of the details are still unknown: “We still don’t know who else from the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/,) was there. We don’t know how that conversation was recorded, if at all. And yet, we still don’t know what the resolution is.”
