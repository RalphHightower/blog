## [As Trump accuses Democrats of ‘buying protestors,’ the lie comes with a radical subtext](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-accuses-democrats-buying-protestors-lie-comes-radical-subtext-rcna225545)

*For nearly a decade, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has accused his public critics of being “paid protesters.” It’s a ridiculous claim rooted in a radical subtext.*

Aug. 18, 2025, 8:38 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

For those who keep an eye on [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s rhetoric, there are a handful of giveaways that make it clear the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is trying to deceive. When the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) tells a story about large, crying men, overcome with emotion because of some amazing thing [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) claims to have accomplished, it’s [a telltale sign](https://www.thestar.com/news/world/analysis/2018/09/08/according-to-donald-trump-a-lot-of-people-are-crying-around-donald-trump.html) he’s lying.

When he tells a story in which unnamed officials keep calling him “sir,” that’s [a dead giveaway](https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/16/politics/sir-trump-telltale-word-false/index.html), too. Likewise, anytime [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) uses the phrases “[ahead of schedule](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/small-business-aid-program-not-way-ahead-schedule-n1180096),” “[got caught](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/got-caught-becomes-one-trump-s-most-obvious-telltale-signs-n1251873)” or, my personal favorite, “[exonerated](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-still-struggling-plain-meaning-exoneration-rcna160154),” he’s lying.

But the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) also has a [habit](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/07/us/politics/trump-new-economic-numbers.html) of [using](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)/113289713317466166) the [phrase](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)/111739140247304467) “just came out” when describing evidence that he’s made up out of whole cloth. On Friday, when he should’ve been preparing for his summit in [Alaska](https://www.alaska.gov/) with [Russia](http://government.ru/)’s [Vladimir Putin](http://kremlin.ru/), the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) pushed an unfortunate variation of the line. As [The New Republic noted](https://newrepublic.com/post/199190/donald-trump-melts-down-washington-dc-protest-national-guard):

> *Washington’s malcontent over the sudden federalization of its law enforcement has apparently come as a surprise to [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). In a post on [Liars Club](https://truthsocial.com/) Friday morning, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) claimed that the people protesting his decision to leverage hundreds of National Guards members to combat a seemingly unfounded rise in crime were actually paid Democratic agents.*

“It’s just been found that the Democrats are buying protestors in order to fight my attack on crime,” the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [wrote online](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)/115033574125099183), using clumsy passive-voice phrasing. The convicted felon added, “These are criminals who support crime.”

The nonsensical claim, which he predictably failed to support with anything resembling evidence, is certainly familiar. Indeed, a couple of months ago, amid protests in the Los Angeles area, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) railed against “[paid insurrectionists](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/paid-insurrectionists-unrest-l-trump-returns-unsettling-old-favorite-rcna212142)[^481],” “[professional agitators](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3lr6u3t4vpi2t)” and “[paid troublemakers](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)/114646378582957392)”

[^481]: @RalphHightower: The only insurrectionists were those that stormed the [Capitol](https://www.congress.gov/) on [January 6, 2021]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}).

As regular readers [might recall](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/speaker-mike-johnson-pans-town-hall-critics-paid-protestors-rcna194024), it’s been one of his go-to claims for a long while. Nine years ago, when [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s 2016 candidacy inspired protests, he assumed that the people involved couldn’t possibly be sincere in their dislike of him. They were, he said at the time, “[paid agitators](https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-WB-63619).”

After he prevailed on [Election Day 2016](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf), there was related anti-[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) activism. Those involved, he said in November 2016, were “[paid protesters](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/14/why-donald-trump-and-his-supporters-want-you-to-think-protests-against-him-are-manufactured/).” Months later, after his inauguration, the activism continued. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) assured the public once more that these Americans deserved to be ignored — because, he assumed, they were “[paid protesters](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-and-his-republican-allies-cling-the-paid-protester-myth-msna950536).”

The following year, Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination inspired another round of progressive activism. The protesters, Trump insisted, were “[paid professionals](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/05/us/politics/trump-kavanaugh-protesters-paid.html).”

Earlier this year, as [congressional](https://www.congress.gov/) [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s faced public backlashes at local events, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) assured the public: “Paid ‘troublemakers’ are attending [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) Town Hall Meetings.”

For now, let’s not dwell on the fact that Russia’s [Vladimir Putin](http://kremlin.ru/) has [embraced the same tactic](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/putin-calls-russian-protests-absolutely-normal/2011/12/15/gIQArelZvO_story.html). Let’s instead consider the unavoidable bottom line: For [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and too many in his party, Americans who disagree with them are effectively an impossibility that can only be explained through corrupt schemes and illicit payments.

It’s hardly a stretch to draw a straight line from “paid protesters” rhetoric to election denialism: Americans who side with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s are real, while Americans who disagree must necessarily be seen as inauthentic.

Whether the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is prepared to accept this or not, the fact remains that Americans who take to the streets to express their dissatisfaction with him, [as happened again over the weekend](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/fight-the-trump-takeover-protests-redistricting-texas-rcna225289), don’t need to be compensated: Their outrage is sincere.
