[MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/)’s [Ari Melber](https://www.msnbc.com/the-beat-with-ari-melber) delivers a special report tracing the path of crimes, investigations, corruption, insider deals, and the suspicious death of Jeffrey Epstein while in [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) custody. Drawing on government reports, original sources, and legal developments across local and federal cases, [Melber](https://www.msnbc.com/the-beat-with-ari-melber) examines [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and Epstein’s ties, broken vows, and [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s secretive responses. Former federal prosecutor John Flannery and victims advocate and attorney Nancy Erika Smith join to discuss. (Subscribe to Ari’s YouTube now:    / arimelber  )

The controversy over [Donald Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/donald-trump) and his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s handling of the [Jeffrey Epstein case](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/jeffrey-epstein-grand-jury-transcripts-unsealed-ruling-rcna224551) continues.

On Tuesday’s [“The Beat,”](https://www.msnbc.com/the-beat-with-ari-melber) [Ari Melber](https://www.msnbc.com/the-beat-with-ari-melber) delivered a “special report” laying out a timeline of Epstein's case and tracing what he called a “sordid path” of crimes, investigations, corruption and deals with government insiders. [Melber](https://www.msnbc.com/the-beat-with-ari-melber) said the recap raised “fresh questions for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and other government officials.”

[Melber](https://www.msnbc.com/the-beat-with-ari-melber) began with the controversial 2008 [“sweetheart deal”](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/dont-republicans-want-talk-prosecutor-made-epsteins-sweetheart-deal-rcna223597) that federal prosecutors in [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/) gave Esptein. That deal granted the millionaire immunity from prosecution on sex-trafficking charges. The [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) host said the “evasion of accountability” later created a problem for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) during his first stint in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), after he promoted the prosecutor responsible for reaching that agreement with Epstein.

Eventually, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) would bring [new charges against Epstein in 2019.](https://www.msnbc.com/craig-melvin/watch/jeffrey-epstein-charged-with-operating-sex-trafficking-ring-victims-as-young-as-14-63464517643) against Epstein in 2019. But, just a month later, the millionaire [found dead in his](https://www.nbcnews.com/video/special-report-jeffrey-epstein-found-dead-in-jail-cell-65832005830) jail cell from an apparent suicide under circumstances that sparked immediate conspiracy theories. “Everyone knew Epstein was a notorious, high-profile defendant, and yet he died,” [Melber](https://www.msnbc.com/the-beat-with-ari-melber) said.

The Epstein saga has continued to plague [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) into his second term. The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/[administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)/) was heavily criticized by many members of the MAGA base after a [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) and [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) memo released by his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) found that there was [no evidence](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/team-trump-struggles-control-epstein-client-list-fire-helped-create-rcna217441) Epstein had kept a “client list” or that he was murdered.

The [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) also drew ire when [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s former personal lawyer turned [deputy attorney general](https://www.justice.gov/dag/), [Todd Blanche](https://www.justice.gov/dag/), flew to [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/) to question Epstein co-conspirator [Ghislaine Maxwell.](https://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/watch/lawrence-what-did-trump-s-doj-lawyer-offer-ghislaine-maxwell-to-answer-his-questions-today-243813445659). The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has repeatedly said he has the power to pardon Maxwell, who was [moved to a lower security facility](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/ghislaine-maxwell-moved-lower-security-facility-texas-rcna222516) in [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) shortly after her conversation with [Blanche](https://www.justice.gov/dag/).

“Even if we learn nothing else about this, it’s an open scandal for this [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/),” [Melber](https://www.msnbc.com/the-beat-with-ari-melber) observed.

Politics aside, [Melber](https://www.msnbc.com/the-beat-with-ari-melber) reminded viewers that at its core, “this is a case that matters so much to the many people, many victims, whose lives were forever altered by Epstein and Maxwell.”

“The big thing the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has done is continue the secrecy, continue to cut the victims out, and, most astoundingly, help and serve an Epstein sex trafficking co-conspirator over truth or justice for [the victims](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/epstein-files-maxwell-victims-sex-trafficking-rcna223916),” he said.
