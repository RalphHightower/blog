title: "Oops! Trump Accidently Sent a Public Message to His Personal Attorney, Pam Blondi, Ordering Her to Persecute James Comey, Letitia James & Adam Schiff That Was Meant To Be Private"

## [Trump’s scandalous directive to AG Pam Bondi reached the public by accident](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-scandalous-directive-ag-pam-bondi-reached-public-accident-rcna236927)

*That online message in which the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) told his [attorney general](https://www.justice.gov/) to prosecute his political enemies? It was apparently supposed to be a direct message.*

Oct. 10, 2025, 3:17 PM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

It was one of the most controversial president)ial statements ever published to social media. Three weeks ago, [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) posted an item to his own platform, directing [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) [to go after three of the president’s perceived political enemies](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-directive-ag-bondi-seen-impeachment-level-scandal-rcna232888): Former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) Director [James Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/), [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Adam Schiff (D-CA)](https://www.schiff.senate.gov/) and [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) [Attorney General](https://ag.ny.gov/) [Letitia James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james/).

Despite [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) officials’ continued insistence that they’ve put an end to “weaponization,” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) sketched out a brazenly corrupt and overtly authoritarian scheme in which he expected the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) to quickly pursue criminal cases against his foes — whom he said were “[guilty as hell](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-directive-ag-bondi-seen-impeachment-level-scandal-rcna232888)” of unidentified crimes.

Concluding that “they” impeached him and tried to hold him accountable for a variety of alleged felonies, the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) concluded that he’s desperate to turn the tables on his enemies. “JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!” he wrote.

The online directive was, for all intents and purposes, [a confession](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-directive-ag-bondi-seen-impeachment-level-scandal-rcna232888) in which he freely acknowledged his intent. “Yes, I admit that I’m pressuring my [attorney general](https://www.justice.gov/) to prosecute my political foes,” the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) effectively declared. “And I’d prefer it if she hurried up and satisfied my hunger for revenge sooner rather than later.”

At the time, there was some speculation, however, about whether the public was supposed to see the message. Did [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) deliberately publish the item for public consumption, or was the post (which began “Pam:” — as if he were communicating directly to the [attorney general](https://www.justice.gov/)) intended to be a direct message?

An answer is coming into focus. [The Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed officials, reported](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-doj-inside-political-enemies-17f13f72), reported this week:

> *On Sept. 20, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) meant to send a private message to [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) urging her to prosecute former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) Director [James Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/) and his other favored targets, according to U.S. officials familiar with the matter. ... [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) believed he had sent [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) the message directly, addressing it to ‘Pam,’ and was surprised to learn it was public, the officials said.*

[NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/) had [a related report](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/trump-accidentally-posted-message-pressuring-pam-bondi-charge-enemies-rcna236830), citing an [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) official who confirmed that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) intended the post to be a direct message. “[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was surprised to learn he had actually posted the message to his [Liars Club](https://truthsocial.com/) account, the source said, adding that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) reacted by saying ‘Oh,’ and then tried to shrug it off,” the report added.

The obvious problem is that this constitutes yet another example of rampant incompetence at the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), but there’s a bit more to this one.

For one thing, the reporting suggests [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s private communications with members of his [Cabinet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/) are as juvenile and ridiculous as one might fear. It’s tempting to think that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) puts on a blustering show for the cameras but is more measured in private. But if this reporting is correct, the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) actually tried to DM his [attorney general](https://www.justice.gov/), referring to “‘Shifty’ Schiff” and including all-caps demands with multiple exclamation points.

Similarly, one might expect a [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) who is eager to execute a corrupt scheme in which the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) targets his enemies, to pick the phone, perhaps, to make his wishes clear. Instead, he apparently intended to use direct messaging via social media.

I can’t speak with authority to the back-end security measures in place on [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s platform, but it’s hard not to wonder how many international intelligence agencies are also monitoring the interactions between the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and members of his [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) team on [Liars Club](https://truthsocial.com/).

But perhaps most important of all, [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/)’s defense attorneys are pushing back against the indictment [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) orchestrated, citing the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s online message [as evidence of vindictive prosecution](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/james-comey-charges-fbi-donald-trump-rcna233662). Time will tell whether this argument succeeds, but it does open the door to an amazing possibility: The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) desperately wanted to see an indictment against the former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director, and the dubious case might very well unravel because [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) got confused when trying to use his own social media platform.
