## [JB Pritzker puts Stephen Miller on notice: He will be held ‘accountable’](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/chicago-ice-jb-pritzker-trump-stephen-miller-rcna238264)

*The [Illinois](https://www.illinois.gov/) [governor](https://gov.illinois.gov/) also accused Miller of “taking advantage” of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s “diminished capacity” to carry out aggressive immigration enforcement.*

Oct. 17, 2025, 4:39 PM EDT
By [Allison Detzel](https://www.msnbc.com/author/allison-detzel-ncpn1310186)

As [Immigration and Customs Enforcement](https://www.ice.gov/) agents continue to cause chaos [on the streets of Chicago](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-ice-agents-violence-chicago-terror-numb-rcna238003), [Illinois](https://www.illinois.gov/) [Gov.](https://gov.illinois.gov/) [JB Pritzker](https://gov.illinois.gov/about/the-governor.html) says he’s looking beyond [Donald Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/donald-trump) when it comes to accountability, setting his sights on the man he argues is the mastermind behind the endeavor: [Stephen Miller](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/stephen-millers-weird-vision-vast-left-wing-conspiracy-matters-rcna236217).

On Thursday’s [“The Briefing with Jen Psaki,”](https://www.msnbc.com/jen-psaki) [Pritzker](https://gov.illinois.gov/about/the-governor.html) told the [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) host that he believes Miller, who serves as the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security adviser, is running the show behind the scenes and is among those at the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) who are “taking advantage” of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s “diminished capacity.”

“We know that he’s the one who is advising [Kristi Noem](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/us-airports-reject-kristi-noems-partisan-video-key-senator-seeks-inves-rcna237950) at the [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/), the [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) said. “He’s the one who’s advising \[[White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) border czar] [Tom Homan](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/tom-homan-cash-contracts-trump-doj-investigation-rcna232568). ... And of course he’s the spokesperson for this entire endeavor, including about [deploying National Guard into cities](https://www.msnbc.com/news/news-analysis/trump-national-guard-insurrection-act-project-47-newsletter-rcna237558).”

[Pritzker](https://gov.illinois.gov/about/the-governor.html) also said Miller “seems like a dangerous individual,” and that he’s able to wield “the power of the presidency” because [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) “isn’t reining him in.”

[Pritzker](https://gov.illinois.gov/about/the-governor.html) said that although the [Supreme Court](https://www.msnbc.com/supreme-court) gave [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [broad immunity](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-trump-immunity-ruling-ask-jordan-rcna200839) for his actions while in office, that same protection does not apply to members of his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration=): “They’re not always going to be in office. ... The people who serve for the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov%), including all the way down to [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) agents, can be held accountable when there’s a change of [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration=).”

[Pritzker](https://gov.illinois.gov/about/the-governor.html) also noted that even if accountability might not be imminent, he thinks it’s important for figures like Miller to know “that whatever they do now, it’s not like we’re going to forget and it’s not like we don’t have a record of what they’re doing.”
