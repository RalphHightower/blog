## [Trump demolishes the East Wing — and White House norms](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/trump-demolishes-east-wing-white-house-norms-rcna239516)

*The [East Wing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)'s rapid razing bypassed a detailed process for major federal renovation projects in Washington. Now, [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) Democrats are demanding answers.*

Oct. 24, 2025, 9:43 AM EDT
By Laura Barrón-López and Vaughn Hillyard, Senior [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) Correspondent

For a decade, [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has bulldozed through the norms that govern the presidency. This week, that metaphor turned literal: The [East Wing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) of the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) was demolished at [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s behest while bypassing a gauntlet of governmental and private entities normally consulted during major federal renovation projects in the nation’s capital.

Where the [East Wing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) once stood, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) intends to erect a new 90,000-square-foot, \$300 million ballroom primarily paid for with contributions from private donors and major corporations — a number of which have business before federal regulatory agencies or are currently subject to [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) litigation.

Now, a group of [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) is demanding answers about [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s actions and whether any of the donors could be engaging in “quid-pro-quo arrangements.”

In a letter to the heads of the [National Park Service](https://www.nps.gov/) and the [Trust for the National Mall](https://nationalmall.org/), [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)](https://www.warren.senate.gov/) and four colleagues are requesting a detailed accounting of the donors to the ballroom construction project, the amount each is contributing and specifics about the contracting and approval process for the demolition.

“The scale of funds raised for [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s ballroom, [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s personal involvement in fundraising for the project, and the number of corporate donors with business before the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [Administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) raise new questions about whether the [Trust](https://nationalmall.org/) is facilitating corrupt access to and favor-seeking from [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his [Administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/),” the senators write in the letter, provided first to [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/).

A slew of major corporations have contributed to the project so far, including [Apple](https://www.apple.com/), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/), [Palantir Technologies](https://www.palantir.com/), [Meta](https://www.meta.com/), [Comcast](https://www.comcast.com/) (the parent company of [NBCUniversal](https://www.nbcuniversal.com/), cryptocurrency players and tobacco companies, among others.

“These solicitations by [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) raised immediate ethics concerns,” the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) write, citing donations from [Google](https://www.google.com/) (which faces “antitrust litigation brought by the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/)”), the [Union Pacific Railroad](https://www.up.com/) (“currently pursuing a \$85 billion merger that will require federal approval”) and [Caterpillar Inc.](https://www.cat.com/en_US.html) (“actively contesting penalties imposed by the [Occupational Health and Safety Administration](https://www.osha.gov/)”).

“The American public deserves answers about the circumstances surrounding the demolition of the [East Wing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) of the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/),” the senators write. [Sens.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Ron Wyden (D-OR)](https://www.wyden.senate.gov/), [Richard Blumenthal (D-CT)](https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/), [Chris Van Hollen (D-MD)](https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/) and [Ed Markey (D-MA)](https://www.markey.senate.gov/) joined [Warren](https://www.warren.senate.gov/) in signing onto the letter.

“[Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) are more concerned with [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s historic beautification of the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) than they are for American citizens they are hurting because of their reckless government shutdown,” [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) spokesperson Davis Ingle told [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) in a statement. The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) did not address a question about concerns of possible quid-pro-quo between the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) and ballroom donors.

### How the process is designed to work

For days, images of the [East Wing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s demolition have ricocheted across social media, stunning Americans inside the Beltway and beyond with stark visuals of the 123-year-old building reduced to rubble amid plumes of dust. That prompted a rapid response from the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), which has argued that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) was transparent about the size and scope of the project from the beginning.

“I haven’t been transparent? Really?” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said in the [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) on Wednesday, sitting in front of a scale model of the ballroom. “I’ve shown this to everybody that would listen.”

But even as [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has repeatedly talked about building a new ballroom, the norms guiding the construction process appear to have fallen by the wayside.

A rigorous three-part process typically plays out after the [National Park Service](https://www.nps.gov/) submits a plan for new construction at the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). The 12-member [National Capital Planning Commission](http://www.ncpc.gov/) — which oversees federal building construction and includes three presidential appointees — then ensures the project is “in compliance with environmental laws, historical preservation laws and regulations,” said L. Preston Bryant Jr., who chaired the [NCPC](http://www.ncpc.gov/) for nine years beginning under [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Barack Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) and continuing halfway through the first [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/).

“Normally, you would go through the process of early consultation, conceptual review, preliminary review and final approval well before you stick a shovel in the ground, much less start demolishing something like a third of the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/),” Bryant told [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/). “And this whole process could take a year.”

> *“Normally, you would go through the process of early consultation, conceptual review, preliminary review and final approval well before you stick a shovel in the ground, much less start demolishing something like a third of the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/),” said Bryant.*

This week’s demolition began without any plan being submitted to the [NCPC](http://www.ncpc.gov/). An [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) official told [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) that construction plans “have not yet been submitted,” but that they will be at the “appropriate time.”

Asked Thursday whether the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) can tear down anything he wants without oversight, [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the law was on [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s side.

“When it comes to phase one of this project, the tearing down of the current [East Wing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) structure, a submission is not required legally for that,” Leavitt told reporters. “Only for vertical construction will a submission be required.”

Leavitt said the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) would provide the legal opinion she referenced during the briefing, but the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) did not respond to questions from [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) requesting it. Leavitt dismissed questions about whether the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) was following proper procedures for the project, arguing that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is simply updating the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) like other [presidents](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) before him.

The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has also not consulted with the [Commission of Fine Arts](https://www.cfa.gov/), according to a source familiar with the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s outreach — though [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) tapped one of its former members, James C. McCrery II, as the ballroom’s architect.

Since its formation by [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) in 1910, the commission has taken an active role in consulting over how to renovate federal buildings and public spaces so they effectively fit together as part of the broader landscape of the nation’s capital. Since [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s inauguration in January, four of the board members’ terms have expired, but the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has not yet nominated individuals to fill the posts.

Prior to the leveling of the [East Wing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), members of the [White House Historical Association](https://www.whitehousehistory.org/) were welcomed to the complex to help preserve “[East Wing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) history through a comprehensive digital scanning project and photography to create an historic record,” said Jessica Fredericks, a spokesperson for the association. Fredericks added that “historic artifacts from the [East Wing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)” were “preserved and stored” as well.

The association did not provide details on whether the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) sought its advice on the replacement of the [East Wing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and the plans for the new build.

### A growing furor

The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has aggressively pushed back on criticism that it misled the public about the size and scope of the construction project, pointing to renderings released in July that showed a completely changed [East Wing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and colonnade structure.

Over the summer, [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said that the project wouldn’t “interfere with the current building,” specifying that “it’ll be near it, but not touching it.”

This week, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) suggested his view had changed. “In order to do it properly, we had to take down the existing structure,” he said.

On Thursday, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said he’d raised more than \$350 million for his ballroom. According to [National Park Service](https://www.nps.gov/) guidelines, the government agency is to vet all individual and non-profit donations of more than \$1 million and any donation from a corporation that exceeds \$500,000. The [Trust for the National Mall](https://nationalmall.org/)'s role is “to manage private donations made to support the project as the nonprofit partner of the [National Park Service](https://www.nps.gov/),” a spokesperson tells [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/). At the time of publication, they did not respond to questions about whether the donations are charitable deductions.

[MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) has requested figures from the [National Park Service](https://www.nps.gov/) and the [Trust for the National Mall](https://nationalmall.org/) on the amounts donated to the project — information the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has not publicly provided.
