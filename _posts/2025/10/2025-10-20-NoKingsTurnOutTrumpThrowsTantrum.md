## [Trump’s over-the-top reaction to the ‘No Kings’ events was proof of their success](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-top-reaction-no-kings-events-was-proof-success-rcna238603)

*The [“No Kings”](https://www.nokings.org/) events were intended to send a powerful message to an increasingly authoritarian figure, who appeared rattled by the national dispatch.*

Oct. 20, 2025, 7:58 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

A few days before millions of his detractors held [“No Kings”](https://www.nokings.org/) events in communities across the country, [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [told reporters](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3m3b36cxdkk2k), “I hear very few people are going to be there, by the way.” From whom did the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) “hear” this? He didn’t say.

Nevertheless, his allies quickly echoed the assertion. A day later, [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Dan Meuser (T-PA9)](https://meuser.house.gov/) appeared on Newsmax [and said](https://x.com/atrupar/status/1979166338774917373) of the [“No Kings”](https://www.nokings.org/) protests, “They claim there is going to be hundreds of thousands of people. We shall see.”

We did, in fact, see. [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/no-kings-protest-photos-cities-demonstrations-rcna238041):

> *Crowds gathered Saturday in cities across the United States — and overseas — for [No Kings](https://www.nokings.org/) rallies in protest of [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) and to call for the defense of [First Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/) rights. Protesters from [Los Angeles](https://lacity.gov/) to [New York](https://www.nyc.gov/) — including in [Chicago](https://www.chicago.gov/), [Washington, D.C.](https://dc.gov/), and [Austin](https://www.austintexas.gov/), [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) — flooded into streets chanting, marching and waving homemade signs, including some that proclaimed ‘We want all of the government to work’ and ‘Make America Good Again.’*

According to organizers, roughly 7 million people participated in [No Kings](https://www.nokings.org/) demonstrations, of which there were more than 2,700. It was, by any fair measure, one of the largest and most successful one-day domestic protests in modern American history.

The triumph was multifaceted, but it was driven in part by [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) themselves. A great many [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) officials spent the run-up to the events smearing the rallies, their organizers and even their attendees, [slandering the protests as “hate America” rallies](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-slander-no-kings-rallies-party-proving-progressive-activis-rcna238179). If the goal was to discourage participation, the ugly [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) rhetoric backfired.

Ezra Levin, co-founder of the liberal grassroots movement [Indivisible](https://indivisible.org/) that has co-organized the [No Kings](https://www.nokings.org/) rallies, [told The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/17/no-kings-republicans-hate-america/) that RSVPs “skyrocketed” after [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) leaders launched a coordinated effort to smear the events.

But to fully appreciate the scope of Saturday’s progressive breakthrough and the severity of the rebuke [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) faced, consider the reaction from the rallies’ intended target.

On Saturday afternoon, The New York Times asked the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) for the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s reaction to the demonstration. “Who cares?” [a Trump spokesperson replied](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/18/us/protests-trump-no-kings.html).

What quickly became apparent, however, was that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) cared quite a bit. [NBC News also reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-posts-ai-video-dumping-no-kings-protesters-rcna238521):

> *[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) on Saturday posted an AI-generated video depicting him in a fighter jet dropping what appears to be feces on U.S. protesters. ... The video shows [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) dropping the apparent fecal matter on someone who looks like left-wing influencer Harry Sisson and other protesters gathered in an area that seems to be Times Square in [New York City](https://www.nyc.gov/).*

The [AI-generated video](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3m3jbffj3q22w) was, of course, disgusting and a timely reminder of the incumbent [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s juvenile and classless tastes, but it was part of a series of online postings, including [another video](https://x.com/TrumpWarRoom/status/1979643743419711969) featuring [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) in a crown.

A day later, aboard [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/) following his latest weekend of golfing in [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/), the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [continued to whine](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3m3lmy664wh2t) about the [“No Kings”](https://www.nokings.org/) events, characterizing the massive turnout as “very small,” despite reality. He went on to say that he and his team believe “radical left lunatics” were responsible for the demonstrations, adding, “We’re checking it out.”

It’s difficult to know what to make of the offhand comment, but it suggested that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and his operation are interested in some kind of federal investigation into protests organized and held by his critics. (He did not elaborate as to what, exactly, would be “checked out.”)

The [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/)’ Jamelle Bouie noted [in his latest column](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/18/opinion/no-kings-protests-republicans-trump.html), “Nationwide protests with millions of people are a direct rebuke to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s narrative. They send a signal to the most disconnected parts of the American public that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is far from as popular as he says he is, and they send a clear warning to those institutions under pressure from the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/): Bend the knee and lose our business and support.”

By all appearances, none of this was lost on [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), whose over-the-top reaction to the [“No Kings”](https://www.nokings.org/) events offered evidence of their success: They were intended to send a powerful message to an increasingly authoritarian figure, who appeared rattled by the national dispatch.
