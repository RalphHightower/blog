## [Trump’s line on possibly suspending habeas corpus goes from bad to worse](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-line-possibly-suspending-habeas-corpus-goes-bad-worse-rcna236649)

*The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) said he’d leave the future of habeas corpus up to [Kristi Noem](https://www.dhs.gov/person/kristi-noem), who recently made clear that she didn’t know what habeas corpus was.*

Oct. 9, 2025, 11:33 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

The first sign of trouble emerged in early May. After the [Trump administration](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/-took-freedom-speech-away-first-amendment-trump-says-quiet-part-loud-rcna236600) suffered a series of legal setbacks in federal courts, [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller told reporters that he and his colleagues [were “actively looking” at](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/congressional-republicans-hedge-white-house-targets-habeas-corpus-rcna206216) at possibly suspending the writ of habeas corpus.

This was, of course, quite bonkers. As [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/) explained soon after, the writ of habeas corpus dates back centuries, and it “grants anyone detained in the U.S. the right to see a judge, challenge the government’s evidence against them and present a defense.”

To suspend habeas — something that happened during the U.S. Civil War, for example — is to allow the government to lock people up without charges, while denying those in custody the ability to contest their incarceration.

In the four months that followed Miller’s comments, neither [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) nor anyone on his team followed through on this, though it did come up again during [a weird [White House event](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-houses-antifa-roundtable-took-exceedingly-weird-turn-rcna236634) about antifa. [HuffPost reported](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-habeas-corpus-moment_n_68e74d7de4b0b4458cb6f566):

> *[Donald TTrump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was asked at Wednesday’s [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) roundtable that included far-right content creators ... if he’d ‘given any more thought to possibly suspending habeas corpus to not only deal with these insurrectionists across the nation but also to continue rapidly deporting illegal aliens.’ ‘Yeah, uh, suspending who?’ the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) replied.*

After the questioner repeated the question, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) said: “Oh, I don’t know. I’d rather leave that to \[[Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/) [Secretary Kristi Noem](https://www.dhs.gov/person/kristi-noem)\].”

The fact that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) seemed utterly baffled by this certainly reinforced the [the President Bystander thesis](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/counterterrorism-funds-president-bystander-forced-quickly-reverse-cour-rcna235857). Indeed, the very idea that a sitting [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) would defer to the [homeland security secretary](https://www.dhs.gov/person/kristi-noem) to decide whether the government intends to suspend habeas corpus seems, at face value, to be rather insane.

But making matters worse is the fact that [Noem](https://www.dhs.gov/person/kristi-noem), whom [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) apparently intends to empower on the subject, recently was unable to even say what habeas corpus is.

During a congressional hearing in May, [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Maggie Hassan (D-NH)](https://www.hassan.senate.gov/) asked [Noem](https://www.dhs.gov/person/kristi-noem): “What is habeas corpus?”

[The South Dakota Republican replied](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/kristi-noem-flunks-important-test-basic-meaning-habeas-corpus-rcna207982), “Habeas corpus is a constitutional right that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has to be able to remove people from this country,” at which point the senator interrupted to note: “Excuse me, that’s incorrect.”

I can appreciate why the typical American with no legal background might not be able to answer such a question extemporaneously, but [Noem](https://www.dhs.gov/person/kristi-noem) is not a layperson. If anyone should have a rudimentary understanding of what habeas corpus is, it’s the secretary of homeland security. But [Noem](https://www.dhs.gov/person/kristi-noem) flunked this very easy test anyway, leading >Hassan](https://www.hassan.senate.gov/) to set the record straight.

“Habeas corpus is the legal principle that requires that the government provide a public reason for detaining and imprisoning people,” the [New Hampshire Democrat](https://www.hassan.senate.gov/) explained. “If not for that protection, the government could simply arrest people, including American citizens, and hold them indefinitely for no reason. ... Habeas corpus is the foundational right that separates free societies like America from police states like [North Korea](http://naenara.com.kp/).”

As part of the same congressional hearing, [Noem](https://www.dhs.gov/person/kristi-noem) also proceeded to argue that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has the constitutional authority to suspend habeas corpus, but that was wrong, too: The [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/) includes this provision as a constitutional power in [Article I](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/article-1/).

In case this weren’t quite enough, when [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Andy Kim (D-NJ)](https://www.kim.senate.gov/) asked the Cabinet secretary which part of the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/) includes habeas corpus, [Noem was again stumped](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/kristi-noem-flunks-important-test-basic-meaning-habeas-corpus-rcna207982).

Nevertheless, when the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) was asked about whether this bedrock legal principle would remain intact in the United States, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) appeared lost and deferred to a [Cabinet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/) secretary who also seems to have a questionable grasp on the underlying subject.
