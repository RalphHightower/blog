## [One easy way Trump could fact-check allegations about his relationship with Epstein](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/pam-bondi-jeffrey-epstein-files-trump-fact-check-rcna236482)

*The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has repeatedly denied doing anything improper with the disgraced financier. But the story still won’t go away.*

Oct. 8, 2025, 4:12 PM EDT
By Chris Hayes

This is an adapted excerpt from the [Oct. 7](https://www.msnbc.com/all) episode of [“All In with Chris Hayes” ](http://www.msnbc.com/all)

The story of the late sex trafficker [Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/ghislaine-maxwell-possible-pardon-trump-epstein-rcna236147) just will not go away, and [Attorney General Pam Bondi](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/pam-bondi-attacks-democrats-republicans-senate-hearing-rcna236398?icid=latestpost_bot) is at the center of the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s response to it.

Remember, [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) is the one who told [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bondi-says-epstein-client-list-sitting-my-desk-right-now-reviewing-jfk-mlk-files) back in February that she had the Epstein files sitting on her desk, awaiting release. She’s also the one who tasked agents with working around the clock to vet all of the material the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov=) has collected on Epstein, including reportedly flagging mentions of [Donald Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/donald-trump) — that is, according to [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Dick Durbin (D-IL)](https://www.durbin.senate.gov/), the ranking member on the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Judiciary Committee](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/), who cited a protected [FBI whistleblower disclosure.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/fbi-personnel-jeffrey-epstein-files-mentioning-trump-dick-durbin-says-rcna219699).

So predictably, when [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) sat before that committee on Tuesday, the topic of Epstein naturally came up.

During one notable exchange with [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI)](https://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/), [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) was asked about reporting from author [Michael Wolff,](https://www.msnbc.com/11th-hour/watch/michael-wolff-profiles-modern-monsters-124004933690) who alleged Epstein had shown him a photo of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) with topless young women. [Whitehouse](https://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/) questioned [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) whether she was aware if the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) had found those photographs in its search of Epstein’s estate.

[Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) shot back, accusing the senator of making “salacious remarks” and “trying to slander” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). The [attorney general](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general=) also alleged [Whitehouse](https://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/) took money from “one of Epstein’s closest confidants,” Reid Hoffman.

Hoffman [has said](https://www.axios.com/2019/09/12/reid-hoffman-jeffrey-epstein-mit-donations) his interactions with Epstein were limited only to fundraising for the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://www.mit.edu/) and that he deeply regrets his role in rehabilitating the disgraced financier’s reputation after his 2008 arrest. And in [a video](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPhX67rD1BE/) posted after [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/)’s testimony, [Whitehouse](https://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/) said Hoffman has never given him “a dime.”

But none of this has anything to do with the senator’s initial question, which was about supposed pictures of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) posing with half-naked young women — pictures that Epstein is alleged to have possessed.

In fact, [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) did not actually respond one way or the other to the question. When [The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeffrey-epstein-showed-pics-of-donald-trump-with-topless-young-women-claims-author-michael-wolff/) first reported on Wolff’s allegations back in October of 2024, the then-[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) campaign told the outlet:

> *Michael Wolff is a disgraced writer who routinely fabricates lies in order to sell fiction books because he clearly has no morals or ethics. He waited until days before the election to make outlandish false smears all in an effort to engage in blatant election interference on behalf of Kamala Harris. He’s a failed journalist that is resorting to lying for attention.*

Since his re-election, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has repeatedly denied doing anything improper with Epstein, and the White House has insisted the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) cut ties with the financier for being a “[“creep.”](https://www.msnbc.com/chris-jansing-reports/watch/-are-we-still-talking-about-this-creep-trump-slams-reporter-s-question-on-epstein-242857029652)”

To be completely clear, this is just one accusation from one person who spoke to Epstein. We have no means of independently verifying Wolff’s reporting — nor does anyone, really. But given that it was introduced into the congressional record by a sitting U.S. senator, it’s worth exploring where this allegation came from.

Of course, there is a way to possibly fact-check this allegation involving [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and the many other claims surrounding Epstein: [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) could vote to release the [Epstein files.](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-esptein-files-petition-ro-khanna-rcna230592) But right now, [House Speaker](https://speaker.house.gov/) [Mike Johnson (T-LA4)](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) is blocking that vote, in part by refusing to seat Democratic [Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/jeffrey-epstein-files-release-congress-adelita-grijalva-rcna235990) of [Arizona](https://www.az.gov/), who won her special election two weeks ago.
