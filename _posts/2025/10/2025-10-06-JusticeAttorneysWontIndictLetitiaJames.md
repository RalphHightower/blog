## [Top prosecutor refusing to charge New York AG despite Trump pressure](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/top-prosecutor-trump-pressure-charge-new-york-ag-rcna235922)

*A key federal prosecutor in Virginia, where [James Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/) was indicted, is resisting bringing charges against [Letitia James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james).*

Oct. 6, 2025, 1:57 PM EDT
By Carol Leonnig and Ken Dilanian

A top prosecutor in Virginia has informed colleagues she plans to decline to seek charges against [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) [Attorney General](https://ag.ny.gov/) [Letitia James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james), resisting [intense pressure from President Donald Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/donald-trump-letitia-james-subpoenas-rcna224310), according to two people familiar with her discussions.

[Elizabeth Yusi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabeth-yusi-198025a3/), who oversees major criminal prosecutions in the Norfolk office of the [Eastern District of Virginia](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/), has confided to co-workers that she sees no probable cause to believe [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james) engaged in mortgage fraud, the two sources told [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/). [Yusi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabeth-yusi-198025a3/) plans to present her conclusion to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s new interim [U.S. attorney](https://www.justice.gov/), [Lindsey Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/), in the coming weeks, they said.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) installed [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) after he announced two weeks ago that he would fire the first acting [U.S. attorney](https://www.justice.gov/) he appointed to the post, Erik Siebert, who resisted seeking fraud charges against [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james) and other charges against former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Director James Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/). [Siebert resigned](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/watch/breaking-u-s-attorney-to-resign-amid-pressure-from-trump-admin-to-indict-new-york-ag-james-247982661865) Sept. 19 after learning he would lose his job.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) then named [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/), a [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) aide and insurance lawyer with no prosecutorial experience who had previously been his personal defense lawyer, to replace Siebert. A few days after taking the reins in the [Eastern District](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/), [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) [sought and won the indictment](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/james-comey-indictment-congress-fbi-director-rcna233691) of [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/) on charges of lying to [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) and obstructing a congressional proceeding, a case that Siebert and office colleagues considered too weak to charge, the people said.

> *Federal prosecutors in Virginia are bracing for the top supervisor in Norfolk to be fired for resisting pressure from [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to prosecute [Letitia James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james), one of his perceived enemies.*

Prosecutors in the [Eastern District](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) are now bracing for [Yusi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabeth-yusi-198025a3/) to be fired for her own resistance to try a case that many lawyers have said lacks sufficient evidence, according to the two people.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has publicly called on the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) to criminally prosecute [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james), despite the conclusion of career prosecutors that they cannot prove she lied or intended to lie on a mortgage application for her niece’s home, according to the people. In [a Truth Social post Saturday](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)/posts/115317676598981431), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) called [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james) “SCUM,” saying she should be removed as New York attorney general and pointing to what he called “her WITCH HUNT against [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald J. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), and others.”

The [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) declined to comment. The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Career prosecutors in the [Eastern District of Virginia](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) also fear their colleagues will be pressured to seek an indictment against [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james), or risk being fired, the two people familiar with internal discussions said. [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) has been closely monitoring progress on the case, these people said.

Such preliminary charging decisions are normally recommended by line prosecutors who would be sifting through the facts in the investigation and would report to [Yusi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabeth-yusi-198025a3/). But in the politically charged case of [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james), the senior supervisor in the Norfolk office has taken measures to try to protect her staff who have been handling the case before a grand jury, the person said.

“This supervisor clearly is doing the right and ethical thing by refusing to bend her legal conclusions to fit the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s desire for political retribution,” Randall Eliason, the former top public corruption prosecutor at the [U.S. Attorney’s Office](https://www.justice.gov/) for the [District of Columbia](https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc) and a retired law professor, told [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/).

But he said it is “tragic” that career prosecutors are being “forced to choose between honoring their oaths and risking their livelihood” and “forced out by the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s politicization of the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/).”

> *The [U.S. Attorney's Office](https://www.justice.gov/) for the [Eastern District of Virginia](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) has become a flash point in the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)'s persecution of officials whom the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has deemed to be his foes.*

The new developments follow other departures from an office that has become a flash point in the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s persecution of officials whom the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has deemed to be his foes.

On Friday, the top national security prosecutor in [Virginia’s Eastern District](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) railed against [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) political appointees for carrying out [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s directives rather than fulfilling their oath to “follow the facts and the law wherever they lead, free from fear or favor, and unhindered by political interference.”

The prosecutor, Michael Ben’Ary, had been fired after a [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) ally questioned his loyalty to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) in a social media post. Ben’Ary wrote in a letter, “In recent months, the political leadership of the Department have violated these principles, jeopardizing our national security and making American citizens less safe.”

[James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james) successfully sued [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his real [estate company](https://www.trump.com/), the [Trump Organization](https://www.trump.com/), for what she said was a series of fraudulent business practices, securing a [2024 civil fraud verdict](https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2024/attorney-general-james-wins-landmark-victory-case-against-donald-trump) and a nearly [\$500 million penalty](https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2024/attorney-general-james-wins-landmark-victory-case-against-donald-trump) from a [New York](https;//www.ny.gov/) judge. The verdict was upheld on appeal, but the monetary penalty was thrown out two months ago, in August, after a court deemed it excessive. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) proclaimed “total victory” after the appellate court’s decision, while [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james) vowed to appeal.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has repeatedly insisted [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james) face consequences for what he deemed to be a spurious attack on him.

The allegation that [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james) engaged in mortgage fraud stems from a May “criminal referral” made by [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) ally [Bill Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte), whom the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) appointed as director of the [Federal Housing Finance Agency](https://www.fhfa.gov=). He cited “media reports” suggesting that [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james) had falsely claimed a [Norfolk](https://www.norfolk.gov/), [Virginia](https://www.virginia.gov/), home where her niece resides as her primary residence to secure a lower mortgage rate.

[James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james)’ attorney, Abbe Lowell, has said [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james) made no such claim in helping her niece seek a loan for a home, and [submitted evidence to Attorney General Pam Bondi from James’ own writing at the time](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/24/us/nyag-james-letter-to-ag-bondi.html). Lowell noted that a power-of-attorney form had mistakenly listed the house as a primary residence, but that [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james) herself checked “no” on the loan application when asked if the house was her primary home. In addition, according to Lowell, [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james) also sent an email to her mortgage broker stating the house “WILL NOT be my primary residence.”

In a Sept. 20 social media post, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) called on [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) to prosecute the alleged crimes of [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james), former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Director James Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/) and [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Adam Schiff D-CA)](https://www.schiff.senate.gov/). He claimed they were “all guilty as hell.” The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) pointed to his two impeachments and multiple indictments as baseless.

He wrote: “We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility” and that “JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”
