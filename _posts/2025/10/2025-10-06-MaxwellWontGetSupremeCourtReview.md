Rep. Elect Adelita Grijalva from Arizona, who would be the final signature needed on a discharge petition forcing a House vote on the Epstein files, has yet to be sworn in to Congress nearly two weeks after her election. Grijalva joins The Weekend: Primetime to discuss what she sees as the reason for the delay and what comes next in getting her sworn in to office.

## [Supreme Court won’t review Ghislaine Maxwell’s appeal, which cited Epstein agreement](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/ghislaine-maxwell-appeal-supreme-court-epstein-trump-rcna235391)

*The convicted sex trafficker invoked Jeffrey Epstein’s infamous non-prosecution agreement that barred prosecuting his co-conspirators.*

Oct. 6, 2025, 9:39 AM EDT
By [Jordan Rubin](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jordan-rubin-ncpn1301611)

The [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) declined to review [Ghislaine Maxwell’s appeal](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-ghislaine-maxwell-review-private-conference-rcna221981)’s appeal, in a rejection that could keep the sex trafficker locked up for another decade if [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [doesn’t grant her clemency](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-ghislaine-maxwell-pardon-unlikely-epstein-case-rcna221335).

Monday’s denial, which was the [most likely outcome](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-ghislaine-maxwell-petition-epstein-trump-rcna233941) of Maxwell’s petition, follows an [appeals court ruling](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/ghislaine-maxwell-supreme-court-appeal-brief-epstein-trump-rcna221567) that upheld her 2021 conviction in [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) for conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein [to sexually abuse minors](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/ghislaine-maxwell-sentenced-20-years-prison-conspiring-jeffrey-epstein-sexually-abuse).

It takes four justices to grant review of a petition. The denial came in an [order list](https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/100625zor_5368.pdf) containing actions in pending appeals as the justices [start the 2025-26 term](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-term-trump-cases-deadline-newsletter-rcna235474).

The federal [Bureau of Prisons](https://www.bop.gov/) [lists Maxwell’s release date](https://www.bop.gov/inmateloc/) as July 17, 2037. The 63-year-old was moved to a minimum-security facility after she had an [unusual meeting](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/ghislaine-maxwell-todd-blanche-doj-transcripts-audio-rcna226676) this summer with [Deputy](https://www.justice.gov/dag/) [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Todd Blanche](https://www.justice.gov/dag/) (a former [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) personal lawyer), during which she said she never [never saw Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) do anything “inappropriate.”](https://www.justice.gov/storage/audio-files/Interview%20Transcript/Interview%20Transcript%20-%20Maxwell%202025.07.24%20(Redacted).pdf) Her conviction followed Epstein’s 2019 death in custody while he was being held on his own [related charges](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.518649/gov.uscourts.nysd.518649.2.0_7.pdf).

Monday’s denial comes amid political fallout from the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s attempts to fend off [intense backlash](https://www.pbs.org/weta/washingtonweek/video/2025/07/trump-enraged-by-magas-epstein-backlash) to its refusal to release [all the information it has](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/jeffrey-epstein-grand-jury-transcripts-unsealed-ruling-rcna224551) on the late disgraced financier.

The legal argument in Maxwell’s petition centered on Epstein’s [notorious non-prosecution agreement](https://www.npr.org/2020/11/12/934265386/jeffrey-epsteins-former-prosecutors-used-poor-judgment-in-deal-doj-says) in [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/) that said, in part, that “the United States also agrees that it will not institute any criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein.” She argued that the agreement should have applied to her [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) case. The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) [opposed high court review](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-1073/365132/20250714161434468_24-1073_Maxwell_Opp.pdf), arguing, among other things, that the agreement wasn’t intended to bind districts outside of [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/).

Maxwell had [urged the justices](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-ghislaine-maxwell-appeal-epstein-trump-rcna220042) to take her case not only to resolve her appeal but also to settle a split among the nation’s courts about how to interpret such agreements. The [National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers](https://www.nacdl.org/) backed her appeal, [asking the justices](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-1073/358461/20250509132003864_24-1073%20Amicus%20Brief.pdf) to grant review and “resolve the split among the circuits and ensure that defendants and their counsel can rely on the promises made by the United States in its written agreements.”
