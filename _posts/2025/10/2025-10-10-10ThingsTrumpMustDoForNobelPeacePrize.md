*The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) begged for the honor but didn’t get it. If he wants to try again next year, there are a variety of steps he can and should take.*

Oct. 10, 2025, 4:16 PM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

With less than a day to go before the [Norwegian](https://www.regjeringen.no/) [Nobel Committee](https://www.nobelprize.org/about/the-norwegian-nobel-committee/) [announced the latest recipient](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/nobel-peace-prize-2025-winner-machado-trump-rcna236645) of the [Nobel Peace Prize](https://www.nobelpeaceprize.org/), [Donald Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/public-sours-economic-performance-trump-tries-playing-make-believe-rcna236900) made one last pitch, describing how impressed he was with himself.

“I don’t know what they’re going to do, really, but I know this: Nobody in history has solved eight wars in a period of nine months, and I’ve stopped eight wars,” the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [told reporters](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-bilat-alexander-stubb-finland-october-9-2025/) at a [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) event. “So, that’s never happened before. But they’ll have to do what they do.”

His boasts weren’t at all true — [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [hasn’t solved](https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/23/politics/fact-check-un-speech-claims-trump) eight wars, no matter how many times he claims otherwise — and they also weren’t persuasive. My MSNBC colleague [Erum Salam reported](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/nobel-peace-prize-2025-winner-machado-trump-rcna236645) reported:

[María Corina Machado](https://www.facebook.com/mariacorinaya), a [Venezuelan](https://presidencia.gob.ve/) politician, has won the 2025 [Nobel Peace Prize](https://www.nobelpeaceprize.org/), the award’s committee announced Friday. [Machado](https://www.facebook.com/mariacorinaya) is a democracy advocate and opposition leader who has built a powerful social movement despite the brutal authoritarian tactics of [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Nicolás Maduro](https://presidencia.gob.ve/Site/Web/Principal/paginas/classPresidente.php).

The [Norwegian](https://www.regjeringen.no/) [Nobel Committee](https://www.nobelprize.org/about/the-norwegian-nobel-committee/) said [Machado](https://www.facebook.com/mariacorinaya) earned the honor due to “her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of [Venezuela](https://www.presidencia.gob.ve/) and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy,” calling her “one of the most extraordinary examples of civilian courage in Latin America in recent times.”

The news no doubt disappointed [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), who has spent months practically begging for the honor. “I’m not politicking for it,” the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) said in August. It was one of his more laughable lies.

That said, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is only in the first year of his second term, and there’s no reason he can’t start a new campaign for the 2026 [Nobel Peace Prize](https://www.nobelpeaceprize.org/). If he’s serious about the goal, however, I have some tips the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) might want to consider.

1. Abandon authoritarianism: The committee’s members have traditionally looked favorably on those who support democracy over authoritarianism, so if [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) were to abandon his anti-democratic agenda, it would almost certainly improve his odds.
2. Stop extrajudicial killings: Using the military to execute deadly strikes against civilian boats in international waters tends to be frowned upon by those who choose the [Nobel Peace Prize](https://www.nobelpeaceprize.org/).
3. Stop threatening [Venezuela](https://www.presidencia.gob.ve/): [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s recent saber-rattling toward Caracas didn’t exactly scream “peacemaker.”
4. Stop trying to annex countries that don’t belong to the United States: Over the course of the year, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has expressed unnerving interest in acquiring [Canada](https://www.canada.ca/), [Greenland](https://grl-rep.dk/en/rep/sek), the [Panama Canal](https://pancanal.com/en/) and the Gaza Strip. When authoritarian leaders start talking about annexing foreign countries and properties for no reason, it tends to get the [Norwegian](https://www.regjeringen.no/) [Nobel Committee](https://www.nobelprize.org/about/the-norwegian-nobel-committee/)’s attention, and not in a good way.
5. Stop praising and aligning the [[White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) with dictatorial regimes: The more [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [cozies up](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/russia-trump-rejects-public-attitudes-takes-new-kremlin-aligned-steps-rcna196709) to foreign tyrants and despots, the less he looks like a [Nobel Peace Prize](https://www.nobelpeaceprize.org/) recipient.
6. Stop lying: It’s unrealistic to think the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) will turn over a new leaf regarding the importance of honesty, but the [Norwegian](https://www.regjeringen.no/) [Nobel Committee](https://www.nobelprize.org/about/the-norwegian-nobel-committee/) knows full well that the American [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) didn’t resolve eight wars in nine months, so there’s little value to him pretending otherwise.
7. Stop militarizing American cities: No one has ever won a [Nobel Peace Prize](https://www.nobelpeaceprize.org/) after sending armed troops into his or her own country’s civilian streets without a good reason. (While he’s at it, dropping the “Department of War” nonsense might help, too.)
8. Stop the trade war: [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is destabilizing economies, disrupting markets, hurting farmers and shifting alliances. Undoing what he has done on trade would very likely impress the [Norwegian](https://www.regjeringen.no/) panelists.
9. Reverse course on [USAID](https://www.usaid.gov/): [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s cuts to the program have been [deadly and brutal](https://apnews.com/article/myanmar-usaid-thailand-trump-rubio-aid-7f6919a1863ceea2ddf6708e47bb88f0). Restoring the United States’ role as the pre-eminent global leader on foreign aid would dramatically improve [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s odds of winning a [Nobel Peace Prize](https://www.nobelpeaceprize.org/). (Conversely, his decision to gut the [U.S. Agency for International Development](https://www.usaid.gov/) made him a pariah in many parts of the world.)
10. Stop begging: Honestly, it’s unseemly to see the chief executive of a global superpower pleading in pitiful ways for an award. It’s likely the [Norwegian](https://www.regjeringen.no/) [Nobel Committee](https://www.nobelprize.org/about/the-norwegian-nobel-committee/) doesn’t want to be seen as caving to pressure, so [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s chances would likely be better if he just shut up about it.
