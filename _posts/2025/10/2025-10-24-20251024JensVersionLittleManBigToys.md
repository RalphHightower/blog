[Jen Psaki](https://www.msnbc.com/jen-psaki) addresses questions posed at the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) press briefing, giving more honest and direct answers than the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is willing to offer on questions ranging from [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s desecration of the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s pardoning of a crypto-criminal business associate.
