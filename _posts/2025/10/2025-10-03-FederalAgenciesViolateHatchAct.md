title: "Federal Agencies Are Violating the Hatch Act By Politicization of the Government Shutdown"

The most egre​gious violation is the [Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)](https://www.hud) which displays a Javascript alert blaming the "far-left Democrats" for the shutdown. It requires anyone viewing any [HUD](https://www.hud.gov/) pages to click the [Okay] button to continue. 

## [Trump’s partisan shutdown emails break the law, top Oversight Democrat says](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/oversight-democrat-trump-shutdown-emails-illegal-rcna235156)

*[Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Robert Garcia](https://robertgarcia.house.gov/) is asking for an [Office of the Special Counsel](https://osc.gov/) investigation into the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s shutdown guidance.*

Oct. 2, 2025, 10:18 AM EDT

By Ali Vitali, Capitol Hill correspondent for [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/)

The top [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) on the [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Oversight Committee](https://oversight.house.gov/), [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Robert Garcia (D-CA42)](https://robertgarcia.house.gov/), thinks the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) is in “blatant violation of the law” for “misuse of taxpayer dollars for political purposes” over [partisan agency guidance](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/trump-shutdown-guidance-blame-democrats-emails-rcna235021) offered to government employees during the shutdown.

And [Garcia](https://robertgarcia.house.gov/) wants the [Office of the Special Counsel](https://osc.gov/) to investigate.

“I write regarding the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [Administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s apparent violations of the Hatch Act, and illegal use of government resources to promote a false, partisan [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) political agenda,” [Garcia](https://robertgarcia.house.gov/), who is the ranking member of the [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Oversight Committee](https://oversight.house.gov/), wrote in a letter to the [Office of the Special Counsel](https://osc.gov/) that was first obtained by [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/).

> *[Garcia](https://robertgarcia.house.gov/) goes on to deem these possible Hatch Act violations part of “a pattern of abuse and politicization of Executive Branch agencies.”*

[Garcia](https://robertgarcia.house.gov/) references [multiple agencies that have pushed public and private communications blaming [Democrats for the ongoing government shutdown](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/trump-shutdown-guidance-blame-democrats-emails-rcna235021) — messages that potentially violate a law called the Hatch Act, which bars political speech and activity by federal officials in taxpayer-funded roles.

The letter, addressed to [OSC](https://osc.gov/) acting head [Jamieson Greer](https://ustr.gov/about-us/biographies-key-officials) — who also serves as the [U.S. trade representative](https://ustr.gov/about-us/biographies-key-officials) — ties this latest inquiry to broader investigations into “attempts by the [Administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) to leverage federal power to advance partisan political ends, including recent efforts to censor prominent critics of [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).”

[Garcia](https://robertgarcia.house.gov/) goes on to deem these possible Hatch Act violations part of “a pattern of abuse and politicization of Executive Branch agencies,” vowing to “investigate fully.”

He asks the [OSC](https://osc.gov/) to immediately investigate “these likely violations of federal law,” and to provide a staff-level briefing “in which you provide detailed information on how you plan to address the Administration’s actions no later than October 16, 2025.”

Responding to the news on [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/)’s “Way Too Early” on Thursday, [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Jake Auchincloss (D-MA4)](https://auchincloss.house.gov/), said the agencies’ posts were “almost unquestionably illegal,” calling it “just the tip of the iceberg of a much deeper level of corruption and grift.”

Ethics experts have railed against violations of norms and laws throughout the first months of [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/), from accepting the gift of a [Qatari jet](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) to be the new [Air Force One](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/) to the issuance of a [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-themed [crypto coin](https://gettrumpmemes.com/).

“Everyone was aghast at the airplane that the [Qataris](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) gave to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/),” Auchincloss said. “At least Americans knew who was giving the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) a bribe. With the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) coin, you don’t even know who’s buying the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) … So the corruption here is endemic, it’s systemic.”
