## [Private call shows early fissures over Mike Johnson's shutdown strategy](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/private-call-fissures-gop-shutdown-strategy-rcna236697)

*Some [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) are questioning the wisdom of a key aspect of [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/)'s strategy.*

Oct. 9, 2025, 3:52 PM EDT

By Mychael Schnell, congressional reporter at [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/)

Throughout the shutdown, a key piece of [Speaker](https://speaker.house.gov/) [Mike Johnson (T-LA4)](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/)’s strategy has been to keep the [House](https://www.house.gov/) out of session, hoping that his chamber’s absence will force [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) to accept the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/)’s funding bill. But as [the standoff stretches into its second week](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/democrats-embrace-shutdown-ridiculously-abnormal-rcna236685), some [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) are questioning the wisdom of keeping lawmakers out of Washington.

During a private conference call with [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) on Thursday, at least three [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) lawmakers — [Reps.](https://www.house.gov/) [Stephanie Bice (T-OK5)](https://bice.house.gov/), [Jay Obernolte (T-CA23)](https://obernolte.house.gov/) and [Julie Fedorchak (T-ND0)](https://fedorchak.house.gov/) — raised concerns about the [House](https://www.house.gov/) remaining out of session next week, according to a source on the call.

“I think we’re gonna get to a point where it’s damaging to continue to keep the [House](https://www.house.gov/) out of session,” [Obernolte](https://obernolte.house.gov/) told his fellow [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/). “I think we’ve gotten to that point.”

The [California Republican](https://obernolte.house.gov/) said keeping lawmakers home would make it look like [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) are “prioritizing politics over government,” according to the source.

[Bice](https://bice.house.gov/) said she has “concerns” about the [House](https://www.house.gov/) lawmakers staying in their districts, adding that she thinks constituents “wonder why we’re not there,” according to the source on the call. She encouraged leadership to consider the optics for next week, noting that members could just as easily message about the shutdown from Washington.

[Fedorchak](https://fedorchak.house.gov/) echoed that sentiment, arguing that the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/)’s messaging would be stronger and more consistent from the Capitol.

The trio is not alone. In an interview with [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/08/politics/mtg-shutdown-trump) this week, [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Marjorie Taylor Greene (T-GA14)](https://greene.house.gov/), said [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) should bring the [House](https://www.house.gov/) back into session. And [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Kevin Kiley, (T-CA3)](https://kiley.house.gov/), said in a [statement to [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) earlier this week](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/republicans-stay-quiet-trump-nixes-projects-districts-rcna236004) that he was “calling on the speaker to bring the [House](https://www.house.gov/) back in session.”

[Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/), for his part, has not shown any interest in modifying his strategy.

For days, the speaker has defended his decision to keep members out of Washington, arguing that the [House](https://www.house.gov/) has done its job by sending a short-term spending bill to the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) for consideration — a measure that most [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) have deemed a nonstarter. [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) continues to say the only path forward is the [House](https://www.house.gov/)-passed bill, trying to place the onus of the shutdown on [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/).

“The [House](https://www.house.gov/) did its job,” [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) said Thursday.

Meanwhile, the [House](https://www.house.gov/) has not voted since Sept. 19.

The private call on Thursday featured some spirited discussion about varying [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) reactions to the shutdown. [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Nicole Malliotakis (T-NY11)](https://malliotakis.house.gov/), appeared to call out [Greene](https://greene.house.gov/) for her recent comments about the shutdown — where [Greene](https://greene.house.gov/) noted that [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) control the [House](https://www.house.gov/), [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) and [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), and called on [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) to address the expiring [Obamacare](https://www.healthcare.gov/) subsidies.

[Malliotakis](https://malliotakis.house.gov/) said the holdup is “obvious”: seven [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) won’t support the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) continuing resolution.

At another point, [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Claudia Tenney (T-NY24)](https://tenney.house.gov/), told a story about being at a gas station and someone saying to her “tell [Marge](https://greene.house.gov/) stop supporting [Chuck Schumer](https://www.schumer.senate.gov/),” according to the source.

> *If we acquiesce to the [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) extortion right now, it is only going to be worse next time.”*

[Speaker](https://speaker.house.gov/) [Mike Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) according to a source

After a dramatic Wednesday on Capitol Hill — which featured two explosive confrontations between [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) and [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) in the hallways — [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) said [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) is “probably” better served with his members at home.

“Is it better for them, probably, being physically separated right now? Yeah, probably is,” [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) told reporters. “Frankly, I wish that weren’t the case. But we do have to turn the volume down.”

[Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/), meanwhile, are using the absent [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) members as fodder for attack, with the prospect of military service members missing a paycheck on Oct. 15 becoming a flashpoint for discussion. Troops will go without pay if [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) does not pass funding for paychecks by Oct. 13.

As a result, a growing number of lawmakers in both parties are urging leaders to pass a standalone bill to pay the troops during the shutdown.

“What [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) need to do is come back so we can address the military pay issue and reopen the government,” [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Minority Leader](https://democraticleader.house.gov/) [Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY8)](https://jeffries.house.gov/), said Thursday. “I mean, this is an extraordinary thing. It’s unbelievable. Members of the [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) conference are upset and perplexed that their leadership has them on vacation week after week after week.”

[House](https://www.house.gov/) [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) leaders have maintained that [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) in the chamber already voted to pay the troops by passing their stopgap bill last month.

When asked by [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) about a potential vote on a standalone bill to pay members of the military, [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Majority Leader](https://www.majorityleader.gov/) [Steve Scalise (T-LA1)](https://scalise.house.gov/), noted that the bill [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) already passed would pay the military.

“I voted for it, [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) did, 99% of [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) voted not to pay our troops,” Scalise said.

Pressed on whether the [House](https://www.house.gov/) would return to Washington next week, Scalise said, “Right now we’re calling on the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) to open the government back up.”

As the debate over the [House](https://www.house.gov/) [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) strategy heats up, [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) is no closer to turning the lights back on in Washington. The [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) failed to advance a pair of spending bills — one crafted by [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/), the other written by [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) — for the seventh time on Thursday. And neither side seems ready to blink.

“If we acquiesce to the [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)ic extortion right now, it is only going to be worse next time,” [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) told his members on Thursday’s call, according to a source.
