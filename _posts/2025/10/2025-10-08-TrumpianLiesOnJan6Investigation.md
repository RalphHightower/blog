## [The latest Republican conspiracy theory about the FBI and Jan. 6 starts to unravel](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/january-6-fbi-republican-conspiracy-theory-rcna236367)

*[Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) are claiming that the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) was caught “spying” on congressional [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) and “tapping” their phones. That’s really not what happened.*

Oct. 8, 2025, 10:57 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

In recent years, [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) officials and their allies have searched high and low for evidence implicating the [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/)-era [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) in political wrongdoing, and to date, the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) hasn’t had much luck. This week, however, the party claimed to have finally succeeded.

On Monday, a group of congressional [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) claimed that the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) analyzed the personal cellphone data of nine [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) lawmakers as part of the probe into the [Jan. 6 attack]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}). [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/fbi-analyzed-republican-senators-phone-records-jan-6-probe-capitol-rio-rcna236063):

> *[Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Judiciary Committee](http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/) Chair [Chuck Grassley (T-IA)](https://www.grassley.senate.gov/), shared a one-page, unclassified document that he said shows that the cellphone ‘tolling data’ of [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) lawmakers was sought and obtained in 2023 as part of the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/)’s ‘Arctic Frost’ investigation — a precursor of special counsel [Jack Smith]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %})’s investigation into efforts by [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his allies to overturn the 2020 election results.*

According to the document released by the Iowa [Republican](https://www.gop.com/), the analysis included eight [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) senators — [Ron Johnson (T-WI)](https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/), [Lindsey Graham (T-SC)](https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/), [Bill Hagerty (T-TN)](https://www.hagerty.senate.gov/), [Josh Hawley (T-MO)](https://www.hawley.senate.gov/), [Dan Sullivan (T-AK)](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/), [Tommy Tuberville (T-AL)](https://www.tuberville.senate.gov/), [Cynthia Lummis (T-WY)](https://www.lummis.senate.gov/) and [Marsha Blackburn (T-TN)](https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/) — as well as [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Mike Kelly T-PA16)](https://kelly.house.gov/).

The day after the claims reached the public, [Grassley declared](https://x.com/ChuckGrassley/status/1975297712712262100) that the controversy was “worse than Watergate,” while [Hawley](https://www.hawley.senate.gov/) [spent much of the day](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/10/07/congress/josh-hawley-fbi-pam-bondi-testimony-00596258) claiming that his phone had been “[tapped](https://bsky.app/profile/acyn.bsky.social/post/3m2mqwu7vzr2p)” by the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/). ([He was lying](https://x.com/kyledcheney/status/1975620647805198562).)

Not surprisingly, [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) joined the partisan parade soon after. “Wow! [Jack Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith/) and the [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) spied on [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [Senators](https://www.senate.gov/) and a least one [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [Congressman](https://www.house.gov/),” the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [wrote online](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115336083572186272) on Tuesday night. “This is really bad ‘stuff.’ They tried to take down the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) Party, and got caught!!!”

Based on the available information, the truth is far more anodyne.

The [New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/07/us/politics/republican-senators-jack-smith-phone-records.html), “The analysis of phone toll records is a common investigative tactic. ... Such toll record information does not include the contents of conversations, which would require a court-approved wiretap.”

A [related analysis from CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/07/politics/republican-lawmaker-records-seized-explained) explained that there’s nothing especially surprising about any of this.

> *We already knew that the phone records of some lawmakers were seized in [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith)’s probe, because the Justice Department had to overcome legal hurdles posed by the Constitution’s Speech or Debate Clause. And it’s difficult to understand how [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) ever could have conducted such a probe without obtaining some phone records of lawmakers. That’s because [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s pressure on lawmakers was a key part of his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. ... It would seem very difficult to piece together a case without understanding who was talking to whom, and when.*

MSNBC’s Ken Dilanian [emphasized a related point](https://x.com/DilanianMSNBC/status/1975374749317353671), noting that the former special counsel’s final report, released earlier this year, made note of these same toll records.

Plenty of other independent observers drew a similar conclusion. “It actually seems sort of obvious that if you’re investigating a former [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) of the United States for trying to subvert an election, you’d probe some of contacts he and alleged co-conspirators had with people he was trying to enlist/pressure to overturn the results,” [Politico](https://www.politico.com/)’s Kyle Cheney [noted](https://x.com/kyledcheney/status/1975384789617418526).

Of course, we know how the coming days, weeks, months and years will unfold. It will now be a simple “fact” that the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) was caught “spying” on congressional [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) and “tapping” their phones as part of a nefarious plot — a claim that will be repeated ad nauseum in conservative media. (For more on how this model of rewriting history works, [see my second book](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/ministry-of-truth-steve-benen?variant=42060890374178).)

But barring additional revelations, that “fact” won’t be true.
