## [Trump keeps making himself the punch line](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-self-parody-white-house-renovations-crypto-unpopular-rcna239597)

*The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is proving once again that he remains a captive of the very stereotype that’s made him a target of ridicule for so many years.*

Oct. 24, 2025, 3:02 PM EDT
By [Jen Psaki](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jen-psaki-ncpn1300286)

This is an adapted excerpt from the [Oct. 23](https://www.msnbc.com/jen-psaki) episode of “The Briefing with Jen Psaki.”

The [The White House Correspondents Dinner](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/watch/journalists-honored-at-white-house-correspondents-dinner-238417477907) is a Washington tradition in which the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and members of the press get together, have a few drinks and tell a few jokes at each other’s expense. It’s an annual event, but the 2011 dinner was especially notable.

That was the year that then-[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Barack Obama](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-abuses-worsen-seems-obama-increasingly-fired-ready-go-rcna232178) got up and absolutely roasted [Donald Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/donald-trump) — and there’s one joke from that night that has a certain resonance today. At the time, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was mulling a run for [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). [During his set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX16OrIVfeQ), [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) said that, if elected, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) “certainly would bring some change to the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).”

> *Authoritarian leaders can become so caught up in projecting their own power that their levels of blatant public corruption just get more laughable as they go.*

[Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) joked about an alternative universe in which [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) found his way into the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and mused about what the real estate developer would do to the historic building, sharing a [mocked-up picture](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/obamas-jokes-target-trump-at-white-house-correspondents-dinner) showing it fitted out with golden columns and a neon sign bearing [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s name.

Fast-forward 14 years, and we are, of course, now living in that alternate universe that [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) conjured up that night. By now, you have seen the images of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s construction crews tearing down the entire [East Wing](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/trump-demolishes-east-wing-white-house-norms-rcna239516) of the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) to make room for a gaudy new ballroom that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) plans to build in its place.

Now, it can be frustrating, even infuriating, to watch [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [destroy a building](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/republicans-cheering-trump-east-wing-demolition-democrats-rcna239413) that belongs to all of us, without approval from [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) or anyone else, just because he feels like it. But in doing so, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is literally making himself the punch line of a 14-year-old joke — a joke about what might happen if a narcissistic real estate developer with horrible taste became the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) of the United States.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is proving once again that he remains a captive of the very stereotype that’s made him a target of ridicule for so many years. He just can’t seem to help himself. In that way, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) himself is a joke, a walking, talking parody.

That’s not to say his actions in office aren’t dangerous — they are — but here’s the thing: [Authoritarian](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/no-kings-protests-trump-successful-anti-authoritarian-movements-rcna238949) leaders can become so caught up in projecting their own power that their levels of blatant public corruption just get more laughable as they go.

Let me give you an example. On Thursday, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) pardoned [Changpeng Zhao](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-house-struggles-defend-trumps-pardon-founder-binance-crypto-exch-rcna239435), the head of a [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.binance.com/en), who was convicted of violating money laundering laws after he allowed criminals to use his [platform](https://www.binance.com/en) to finance everything from child sex abuse to drug trafficking to terrorism. It was an outrageous move, made all the more outrageous by the fact that the company he founded has major business ties to the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) family’s own crypto venture.

When [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was asked about that pardon, he lashed out in his typical way. First, he said he had no idea what the reporter was talking about, even though the company [Zhao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cpzhao/) founded has been campaigning for a pardon for a year. Then, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) seemed to remember who [Zhao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cpzhao/) was and told reporters that “a lot of people say that he wasn’t guilty of anything ... He served four months in jail and they say that he was not guilty of anything.” This is equally ludicrous, because he pleaded guilty.

Look, recognizing the absurdity of that doesn’t minimize the danger of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) — it minimizes [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) himself, it exposes him for the small man he is, and it makes it easier to push back against his corruption.

So now, a number of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s opponents are showing that it isn’t so hard to stand up to an insecure bully. Ever since he retook office, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and his allies in [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) have been targeting special counsel [Jack Smith](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jack-smith-ready-respond-gop-questions-wants-public-see-answers-rcna239538), investigating him and trying to paint him as some kind of devious criminal.

On Thursday, [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) [punched back:](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/watch/-game-on-jack-smith-offers-to-testify-in-public-hearing-over-his-investigation-into-donald-trump-250496069628) His attorneys sent a letter to [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) proclaiming that “[Mr. Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) respectfully requests the opportunity to testify in open hearings before the House and [Senate Judiciary Committees](http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/).”

In other words, [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) is telling [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his cronies that he wants to have this fight, and to have it in public. [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) is calling their bluff because he knows that what he can expose about [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is far worse than anything they can do to him.

We’re seeing that same kind of fight from [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) elected officials who are making the bet that it pays to stand up to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), like [California](https://www.ca.gov/) [Gov. Gavin Newsom](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/watch/-an-epic-troll-gavin-newsom-speaks-trump-s-language-as-redistricting-fight-heats-up-244905541915) and [Illinois](https://www.illinois.gov/) [Gov. JB Pritzker.](https://www.msnbc.com/the-briefing-with-jen-psaki/watch/pritzker-looks-to-hold-law-breaking-ice-agents-to-account-250068037848). Both have taken the fight directly to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), showing very effective ways of dealing with a bully.

On Thursday, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [backed off his threats](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/trump-federal-deployment-san-francisco/3968903/) to send [National Guard](https://www.nationalguard.mil/) troops into [San Francisco](https://www.sf.gov/) after just one call with the city’s [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) mayor. And while it remains to be seen what will happen in the end, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has already blinked, and he’s shown that he will back down.

[Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) can clearly sense that, and in so many different ways, they now feel emboldened to go on offense.

For weeks, the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has been lobbying [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) states to [redraw their congressional maps](https://www.msnbc.com/the-briefing-with-jen-psaki/watch/powerful-pushback-is-disrupting-trump-s-plan-to-rig-election-with-redistricting-250433605793) and to give the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s party a big advantage in the midterms. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s tactics have succeeded in a few states, like [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/) and [North Carolina](https://www.nc.gov/).

Recognizing the absurdity of that doesn’t minimize the danger of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) — it minimizes [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) himself, it exposes him for the small man that he is.

But [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) in [California](https://www.ca.gov/) are pushing back with [Proposition 50,](https://www.msnbc.com/the-briefing-with-jen-psaki/watch/pelosi-fired-up-as-california-is-poised-to-boost-democrats-in-play-for-house-249909317845), giving voters a chance to stand up to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) by voting to redraw their state maps to counter what [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) did in [Texas](https://www.texas.gov/). And after a relentless pressure campaign from [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and [Vice President JD Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/), [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) in [Indiana](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-houses-plan-rig-district-maps-advancing-not-everywhere-rcna239360) still don’t have the votes to redraw maps there and steal more seats. Meanwhile, activists in [Missouri](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkWpQfFZKhY) are working to make sure voters have a chance to overrule any new maps in that state at the ballot box.

On Thursday, [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) in [Virginia](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/us/politics/virginia-democrats-redistrict.html) announced that they are initiating a plan to redraw maps there, potentially netting [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) three new seats in [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/). That makes the state’s gubernatorial election in less than two weeks all the more important, but luckily for [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is hugely unpopular in that state. A new poll from [Suffolk University](https://www.suffolk.edu/-/media/suffolk/documents/academics/research-at-suffolk/suprc/polls/other-states/2025/10_22_2025_virginia_statewide_marginals.pdf?la=en&hash=151508E05025492875040BD1F23D8D5CC60782F6) found the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) underwater by more than 12 points.

So yes, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is cruel and corrupt, he’s knocking down the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) for a ballroom, and he’s shaking down American taxpayers while pardoning a [crypto CEO](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cpzhao/) who has been a huge proponent of his own [crypto business](https://www.binance.com/en). That is all true. But he is also weak. He is unpopular. He’s a joke.

[Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) know that — and they know that it pays to stand up to him.
