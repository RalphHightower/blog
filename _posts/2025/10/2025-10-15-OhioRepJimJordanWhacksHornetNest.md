## [As Republicans seek Jack Smith’s testimony, the former special counsel has plenty to say](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-seek-jack-smiths-testimony-former-special-counsel-plenty-s-rcna237737)

*As [Jim Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/) and other [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) officials drag the special counsel back into the spotlight, the phrase "be careful what you wish for" keeps coming to mind.*

Oct. 15, 2025, 8:52 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

[Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s 2024 election victory marked the beginning of the end of then-special counsel [Jack Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith)’s criminal cases. Almost immediately after Election Day, the prosecutor and his team [grudgingly wrapped up their work](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/sen-mike-lee-doesnt-understand-jack-smiths-cases-rcna182012) — not because they wanted to or because they lacked compelling evidence, but because of [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) guidelines related to prosecuting a sitting [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).

Left without options, [Smith resigned](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/jack-smith-resigns-justice-department-trump-rcna187281) and his criminal indictments against the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) effectively evaporated.

In theory, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) allies could’ve celebrated the demise of [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith)’s cases and moved on. In practice, it’s not quite working out that way.

The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) continues to [peddle baseless attacks](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/january-6-fbi-republican-conspiracy-theory-rcna236367) against the [former special counsel](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith); the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) [continues](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/kash-patel-fires-yet-another-group-fbi-agents-cause-shutters-corruptio-rcna236490) to [push out](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/doj-fires-career-prosecutors-team-trumps-revenge-tour-continues-rcna189586?icid=previouspost_bot) officials who worked with [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith); [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) continue to target [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) with [unhinged and easily discredited](https://www.thedailybeast.com/eric-trump-goes-full-tin-full-hat-in-rant-against-his-dads-nemesis/) conspiracy theories; and [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) lawmakers continue to see the prosecutor as a worthwhile target.

Indeed, nine months ago, [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Judiciary Committee](http://judiciary.house.gov/) [Chairman](http://judiciary.house.gov/the-committee/the-chairman) [Jim Jordan (T-OH4)](https://jordan.house.gov/) said [he was prepared](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/15/congress/jim-jordan-jack-smith-trump-00198533) to call [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) to testify, and this week, the [far-right Ohio Trumpian](https://jordan.house.gov/) followed through, [sending a letter](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/10/14/congress/jordan-wants-jack-smith-testimony-00607878) to the former special counsel, demanding his closed-door testimony.

We’ll learn soon enough whether and when [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) will talk to lawmakers, but the timing of [Jordan](https://jordan.house.gov/)’s summoning is notable in its own right — because as the [Judiciary Committee](http://judiciary.house.gov/) [chair](http://judiciary.house.gov/the-committee/the-chairman) wants to hear from [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith), [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) appears to have quite a bit to say.

A few weeks ago, for example, the former special counsel, who’s maintained an exceedingly low public profile, delivered remarks at [George Mason University](https://www.gmu.edu/) and [sounded the alarm](https://www.npr.org/2025/09/25/nx-s1-5552723/former-special-counsel-jack-smith-warns-that-rule-of-law-is-under-attack) about intensifying threats to the U.S. legal system. “My career has been about the rule of law, and I believe that today it is under attack like in no other period in our lifetimes,” [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) said.

Those were not his final words on the subject. [The New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/us/politics/jack-smith-house-judiciary-committee.html):

> *[Jack Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith), the special counsel who twice secured indictments of [Donald J. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), said it was ‘ludicrous’ to suggest he was motivated by partisan politics — and offered a scathing denunciation of the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) — in his first extended remarks since resigning in January. ‘The idea that politics played a role in who worked on that case, or who got chosen, is ludicrous,’ [Mr. Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) said during an Oct. 8 interview with the former prosecutor [Andrew Weissmann](https://its.law.nyu.edu/facultyprofiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=profile.biography&personid=39254) at the [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/home/welcome-ucl) that was posted online Tuesday.*

At the same event, [the prosecutor added](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/jack-smith-speaks-trump-administration-rare-interview-rcna237688), “I think the attacks on public servants, particularly nonpartisan public servants — I think it has a cost for our country that is incalculable, and I think that we — it’s hard to communicate to folks how much that is going to cost us.”

I understand why [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) have invested so much time and effort into villainizing [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith). He had the audacity to build strong criminal cases against [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), rooted in voluminous evidence. And as the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) works his way through his enemies list, he and his cohorts apparently still see value in trying to discredit the former special counsel.

But they ought to be careful what they wish for. [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) is an experienced, credible and capable prosecutor, who’s familiar with the evidence from [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s criminal cases at a granular level. The more [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) drag him back into the spotlight, the more [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) will be positioned to remind the public about alleged [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)ial felonies the party would probably prefer to forget.
