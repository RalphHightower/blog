## [Mike Johnson's plan to keep the House closed is backfiring](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/mike-johnsons-house-shutdown-epstein-files-rcna237374)

*In recent months, the [House](https://www.house.gov/) [speaker](https://speaker.house.gov/) has kept the chamber closed to an unprecedented degree.*

Oct. 14, 2025, 6:00 AM EDT
By James Downie, [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) Opinion Editor

“All hard work brings a profit,” [says the Book of Proverbs](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2014%3A23&version=NIV), “but mere talk leads only to poverty.” When [Mike Johnson (T-LA4)](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) [told Americans](https://www.mediaite.com/politics/new-house-speaker-tells-hannity-go-pick-up-a-bible-off-your-shelf-and-read-it-thats-my-worldview/) that the Bible was “my worldview” shortly after he was first elected [House](https://www.house.gov/) [speaker](https://speaker.house.gov/), he must have forgotten that passage. In his first year as [speaker](https://speaker.house.gov/) with a [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/), [Johnson (T-LA4)](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/), has increasingly forgone the hard work of legislating while apparently hoping his talk could obscure some uncomfortable truths for Republicans.

Since the [House](https://www.house.gov/) passed a short-term funding bill Sept. 19, [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) and the rest of the [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) leadership team have kept their members out of Washington. [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) and his leadership team insist that, because they passed the funding bill, it’s up to [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) to end the shutdown. In addition, keeping the [House](https://www.house.gov/) out of session means [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/)-elect Adelita Grijalva (D-AZ7) can’t be sworn in. And until she’s sworn in, [she can’t be the 218th signature](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/pam-bondi-jeffrey-epstein-files-trump-fact-check-rcna236482) on a discharge petition forcing a vote over the release of the government’s files on deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

> *The [House](https://www.house.gov/)’s self-imposed absences, in fact, started long before mid-September.*

But as [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/)’s Mychael Schnell [reported last week](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/private-call-fissures-gop-shutdown-strategy-rcna236697), a growing number of [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) representatives are criticizing the strategy — ranging from [Marjorie Taylor Greene (T-GA14)](https://greene.house.gov/) to less conservative members like [Kevin Kiley (T-CA3)](https://kiley.house.gov/). This dissent is particularly noteworthy in a caucus that has consistently stayed in lockstep with leadership and especially with [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).

The [House](https://www.house.gov/)’s self-imposed absences, in fact, started long before mid-September. “Since July 3, the [House](https://www.house.gov/) has only been in session for 20 days (out of more than 100 calendar days),” [Punchbowl News](https://punchbowl.news/)’ Jake Sherman and John Bresnahan wrote Monday. On July 22, [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) [started the House’s summer break](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/epstein-files-speaker-mike-johnson-afraid-rcna220490) early rather than face a vote on releasing the Epstein files. From that point on, Sherman and Bresnahan write, “the [House](https://www.house.gov/) has been AWOL.”

Concerns about [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/)’ shrinking role in running the country long predate [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) and the rest of this generation of congressional leaders, on both sides. But just 20 days in session in more than three months is an astonishingly small number — a rate of less than 80 days in session in a calendar year. The lowest since World War II, for comparison, was the 80th [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/), which had [109 days in session](https://history.house.gov/Institution/Session-Dates/80-89/) in 1948. But unlike this 119th [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/), the “Do Nothing” [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) (as [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) Harry Truman famously deemed it) had two excuses. First, it was in opposition to the sitting [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), limiting the chances for legislation. Second, 1948 was an election year, and [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) typically spends less time in session when its members are campaigning.

Just as the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has been sending mixed messages — alternating between blaming [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)s for the shutdown and using it to fire thousands of federal employees — [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/)’s “stay home” approach has undercut his talking points. It’s difficult to argue that he is serious about swiftly reopening the government when his caucus is spread out around the country. Instead, [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)s seem to be winning the messaging war. [The Washington Post reports](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/12/obamacare-shutdown-republicans-repeal/), “The White [House](https://www.house.gov/) and a growing number of congressional [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s are worried that [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/’ demand to boost Obamacare as part of any bill to reopen the government is proving salient with voters — including their own.”

Speaking of Obamacare, by keeping the [House](https://www.house.gov/) away, [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) has hurt efforts to deal with expiring subsidies for plans on the [Affordable Care Act](https://www.healthcare.gov/) marketplace. “That’s a Dec. 31 issue,” [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) [insisted last week](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/affordable-care-act-subsidies-sticking-point-government-shutdown/story?id=126322841). But that timeline is misleading. “While the enhanced premium tax credits are set to expire at the end of 2025, the start of open enrollment is around the corner on Nov. 1,” says [Miranda Yaver](https://www.publichealth.pitt.edu/directory/miranda-yaver) of the [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/) [School of Public Health](https://www.publichealth.pitt.edu/). If lawmakers don’t agree on a fix before the end of the year, it will be weeks after “marketplace insurers have submitted their initial premium rate proposals, suggesting dramatic premium increases faced by marketplace enrollees.” Without a fix to the subsidies soon, millions of people will be deciding in November whether to pay more next year or forgo coverage altogether. For them, a Dec. 31 deal would come far too late.

> *By delaying Grijalva’s swearing-in, [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) only deepens suspicious that the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is hiding something.*

As for the Epstein files, [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/)’s effort here seems especially futile. Clearly, neither the White [House](https://www.house.gov/) nor [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s in [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) want a vote on releasing the files (though even if the bill passes the [House](https://www.house.gov/), it will certainly die in the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/)). But efforts to derail the discharge petition seem to have failed, and at some point — whether for the [ACA](https://www.healthcare.gov/) subsidies or some other legislation — the [House](https://www.house.gov/) will have to come back. By delaying Grijalva’s swearing-in, [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) only deepens suspicions that the White [House](https://www.house.gov/) is hiding something.

In 1948, Truman ran against the “Do Nothing” [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) and surprisingly won re-election. [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) and other [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) leaders should take note. Staying home and doing nothing can help them put off some hard choices — but whether it’s the Epstein files or people’s health care costs, ducking and running won’t be sustainable.
