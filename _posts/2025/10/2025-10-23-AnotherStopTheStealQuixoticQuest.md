## [As the White House hires another ‘Stop the Steal’ lawyer, failure is inevitable](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-house-hires-another-stop-steal-lawyer-failure-inevitable-rcna238712)

*[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has hired a lawyer to oversee yet another investigation into his [2020 defeat](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf), apparently because the original probes were too reality-based for him.*

Oct. 20, 2025, 3:30 PM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

[Ed Martin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edmartinjr/), one of the nation’s more notorious “Stop the Steal” lawyers, has already been rewarded with [powerful and influential positions](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/pam-bondi-finds-new-job-ed-martin-special-attorney-pursuing-trump-foes-rcna223934) on [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s team. He will not, however, be the only such attorney working within the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s operation. [The Wall Street Journal reported](https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/white-house-hires-stop-the-steal-lawyer-to-investigate-2020-election-claims-6395d322?st=B7iykg&):

> *A former [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) campaign lawyer who worked on the effort to overturn the 2020 election results has joined the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) to investigate that year’s election and voting-related issues, according to people familiar with the matter. Kurt Olsen, a lawyer who unsuccessfully pushed claims of voter fraud, has joined the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) as a ‘special government employee,’ some of the people said.*

According to the [Journal](https://www.wsj.com/)’s report, which has not been independently verified by [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/), Olsen will be working directly with the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). The lawyer has also reportedly taken an interest in voting machines, while “asking intelligence agencies for information about the 2020 election.”

About a year ago, with time running out in the 2024 presidential election and early voting underway across much of the country, then-[Sen. JD Vance](https://bioguide.congress.gov/search/bio/V000137) refused to answer questions about who was the rightful winner of the 2020 race. The Ohio [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [complained at the time](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-steps-vances-message-clings-rigged-election-lie-rcna174049) that political journalists were “obsessed” with the election from four years earlier.

A year later — and roughly five years since [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) lost his re-election bid — someone is “obsessed” with the 2020 race, but it’s not political journalists.

Indeed, on a nearly daily basis, the incumbent [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) continues to whine about his defeat five years ago, pretending that he secretly won despite the results and peddling discredited conspiracy theories intended to rewrite history. (Last week, for example, the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) brought up the 2020 race, unprompted, [Sunday](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-press-gaggle-air-force-one-october-12-2025/#150), [Tuesday](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-bilat-lunch-javier-milei-argentina-october-14-2025/#114), [Thursday](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-ivf-fertility-cost-reductions-october-16-2025/#146) and [Friday](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-bilat-lunch-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-october-17-2025/#113). This was not an especially unusual week.)

Now, evidently, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has even brought on a lawyer to tell him what he wants to hear.

The trouble is, we’ve already been down this path. In 2023, [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) [reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/02/11/trump-campaign-report-electoral-fraud/) on [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s political operation having hired the [Berkeley Research Group](https://www.thinkbrg.com/) to scrutinize the 2020 election. The purpose of the contract was obvious: The then-outgoing [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and his team wanted the researchers to bolster [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s conspiracy theories about voter fraud and election irregularities.

That didn’t work out well: [BRG](https://www.thinkbrg.com/) [couldn’t find any meaningful evidence](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-researchers-reportedly-couldnt-find-evidence-fraud-rcna70554). As my [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) colleague Hayes Brown [joked](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/report-makes-trumps-2020-fundraising-scam-even-clearer-rcna70404), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) “must have really hated that his campaign spent over \$600,000 to be told he was wrong.”

We later learned that [BRG](https://www.thinkbrg.com/) wasn’t alone in tackling this endeavor. Months later, the [Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) published [a related report](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/04/27/trump-false-election-fraud-claims/) on [Team Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) paying \$750,000 to [Simpatico Software Systems](https://simpaticosoftware.com/), which was also tasked with finding evidence of 2020 voter fraud. That didn’t go well, either: The company was unable to tell [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s what they wanted to hear because the evidence simply didn’t exist.

[Ken Block](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenblockri/), the owner of [Simpatico Software Systems](https://simpaticosoftware.com/), later [an op-ed](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2024/01/02/trump-lies-voter-fraud-2020-impact-2024-election/72057016007/) in [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/), published with a striking headline: “[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) paid me to find voter fraud. Then he lied after I found 2020 election wasn’t stolen.”

In his opinion piece, [Block](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenblockri/), a former [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) gubernatorial candidate, explained that his investigation failed to turn up meaningful evidence of voter fraud, adding that rank-and-file [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) voters have been fed “a steady diet of innuendo, misrepresentations and outright lies” on the issue.

I mention this because [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has already initiated investigations into his 2020 defeat. These investigators were motivated to tell their client what he wanted to hear, but even they couldn’t provide [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) with proof that doesn’t exist. The same is true of state-based audits, which confirmed that the actual election results from that race were accurate.

Now, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has reportedly hired a lawyer to oversee yet another investigation, apparently because the original probes, including the ones he paid for, were too reality-based for him.

Whether Olson will be paid with public funds is not yet clear. Watch this space.
