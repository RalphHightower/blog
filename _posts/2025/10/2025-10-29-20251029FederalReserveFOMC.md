## [Federal Reserve Board - Federal Reserve issues FOMC statement](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20251029a.htm)

October 29, 2025

[Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) issues FOMC statement
For release at 2:00 p.m. EDT

Available indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace. Job gains have slowed this year, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remained low through August; more recent indicators are consistent with these developments. Inflation has moved up since earlier in the year and remains somewhat elevated.

The [Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated. The [Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that downside risks to employment rose in recent months.

In support of its goals and in light of the shift in the balance of risks, the [Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 3-3/4 to 4 percent. In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the [Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The [Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) decided to conclude the reduction of its aggregate securities holdings on December 1. The [Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.

In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the [Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The [Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the [Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm)'s goals. The [Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm)'s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.

Voting for the monetary policy action were [Jerome H. Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm), Chair; [John C. Williams](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/federal-reserve-system-new-york.htm), Vice Chair; [Michael S. Barr](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/barr.htm); [Michelle W. Bowman](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/bowman.htm); [Susan M. Collins](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/federal-reserve-system-boston.htm); [Lisa D. Cook](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/cook.htm); [Austan D. Goolsbee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/federal-reserve-system-chicago.htm); [Philip N. Jefferson](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/jefferson.htm); [Alberto G. Musalem](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/federal-reserve-system-st-louis.htm); and [Christopher J. Waller](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/waller.htm). Voting against this action were [Stephen I. Miran](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/miran.htm), who preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point at this meeting, and [Jeffrey R. Schmid](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/federal-reserve-system-kansas-city.htm), who preferred no change to the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting.

Implementation Note issued October 29, 2025
Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation

The [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy stance announced by the [Federal Open Market Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) in its statement on October 29, 2025:

The [Board of Governors](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/default.htm) of the [Federal Reserve System](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) voted unanimously to lower the interest rate paid on reserve balances to 3.90 percent, effective October 30, 2025.
- As part of its policy decision, the [Federal Open Market Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) voted to direct the [Open Market Desk](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_openmarketops.htm) at the [Federal Reserve Bank of New York](https://www.newyorkfed.org/), until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the [System Open Market Account](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_openmarketops.htm) in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:
    - "Effective October 30, 2025, the [Federal Open Market Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) directs the Desk to:

        - Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 3-3/4 to 4 percent.
        - Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 4.0 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of \$500 billion.
        - Conduct standing overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 3.75 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of \$160 billion per day.
        - Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/)'s holdings of [Treasury securities](https://home.treasury.gov/services/bonds-and-securities) maturing in October and November that exceeds a cap of \$5 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap. Beginning on December 1, roll over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities.
        - Reinvest the amount of principal payments from the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/)'s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) received in October and November that exceeds a cap of \$35 billion per month into [Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/) securities to roughly match the maturity composition of [Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/) securities outstanding. Beginning on December 1, reinvest all principal payments from the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/)'s holdings of agency securities into [Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/) bills.
        - Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons."
- In a related action, the [Board of Governors](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/default.htm) of the [Federal Reserve System](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) voted unanimously to approve a 1/4 percentage point decrease in the primary credit rate to 4.0 percent, effective October 30, 2025. In taking this action, the Board approved requests to establish that rate submitted by the Boards of Directors of the [Federal Reserve Banks](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) of [Boston](https://www.bostonfed.org/), [New York](https://www.newyorkfed.org/), [Philadelphia](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/), [Richmond](https://www.richmondfed.org/), [Atlanta](https://www.atlantafed.org/), [Chicago](https://www.chicagofed.org/), [Minneapolis](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/), [Kansas City](https://www.kansascityfed.org/), [Dallas](https://www.dallasfed.org/), and [San Francisco](https://www.frbsf.org/)..
This information will be updated as appropriate to reflect decisions of the [Federal Open Market Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) or the [Board of Governors](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/default.htm) regarding details of the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/)'s operational tools and approach used to implement monetary policy.
