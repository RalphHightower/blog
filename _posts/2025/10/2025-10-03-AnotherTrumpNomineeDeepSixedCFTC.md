## [Crypto advocates derail a Trump nominee who had been slated for confirmation](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/crypto-advocates-derail-trump-nominee-slated-confirmation-rcna235455)

*[Brian Quintenz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-quintenz-3692865/) appears to be the first nominee ever to be derailed by objections from prominent cryptocurrency advocates.*

Oct. 3, 2025, 12:10 PM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

The vast majority of [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) nominees face an easy path to confirmation. The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) tells [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s to approve his picks, regardless of merit, and GOP senators obey.

There are, however, occasional exceptions. Earlier this week, for example, [E.J. Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd)’s outlandish nomination to become the next commissioner of the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/) [failed in the face of bipartisan opposition](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/ej-antonis-failed-nomination-makes-white-house-look-even-incompetent-rcna234896). And while his failure generated a lot of headlines, another nomination failure happened on the same day that you might not have heard about. [Politico reported](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/09/30/congress/white-house-pulls-quintenz-nomination-to-lead-cftc-00589043):

*The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) withdrew [Brian Quintenz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-quintenz-3692865/)’s nomination to chair the [Commodity Futures Trading Commission](https://www.cftc.gov/) late Tuesday, according to two people granted anonymity to discuss the decision ahead of a public announcement. A small but powerful agency, the [CFTC](https://www.cftc.gov/) oversees a broad swath of financial markets including those tied to the cryptocurrency industry.*

[Quintenz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-quintenz-3692865/) appeared well positioned to be confirmed, but over the summer, crypto billionaires [Tyler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tylerwinklevoss/) and [Cameron Winklevoss](https://www.linkedin.com/in/winklevoss/) reportedly raised concerns about the nominee to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).

That appears to have made an enormous difference. As Punchbowl News summarized, [Quintenz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-quintenz-3692865/) was withdrawn “after facing opposition” from the crypto leaders.

This is, oddly enough, an unprecedented development. We’ve seen some [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) nominees fail because they lacked the votes on Capitol Hill ([Matt Gaetz](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/matt-gaetz-withdraws-trump-attorney-general-pick-rcna181207) and [Ed Martin](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-ed-martin-nomination-us-attorney-jan-6-rcna205197)). We’ve seen other nominees fail because the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) neglected to do its due diligence ([Antoni](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/ej-antonis-failed-nomination-makes-white-house-look-even-incompetent-rcna234896) and [Jared Isaacman](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/demise-trumps-nasa-pick-different-personnel-failures-rcna210461)). We’ve seen instances in which nominees failed because of objections from the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s MAGA base [Dr. Janette Nesheiwat](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/white-house-surgeon-general-nominee-casey-means-janette-nesheiwat-rcna205476). We’ve even seen one nominee fail because of [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) concerns about Democrats making potential gains in [Congress](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) ([Elise Stefanik](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/elise-stefanik-nomination-un-ambassador-trump-rcna198432?icid=latestpost_bot)).

But [Quintenz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-quintenz-3692865/) appears to be the first nominee ever to be derailed by objections from prominent cryptocurrency advocates.

The developments, [Politico](https://www.politico.com/) noted, were “an illustration of the new balance of power in [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s Washington.”

Indeed, the demise of [Quintenz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-quintenz-3692865/)’s nomination came about a month after [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Tim Scott (T-SC)](https://www.scott.senate.gov/), the chair of the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Banking Committee](http://www.banking.senate.gov/public) who’s currently leading the [National Republican Senatorial Committee](https://www.nrsc.org/), appeared at a crypto conference in [Jackson Hole](https://www.jacksonwy.gov/), [where he thanked the industry](https://punchbowl.news/article/senate/scott-brown/) for “getting rid of” former [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Sherrod Brown](https://www.sherrodbrown.com/). As [Scott](https://www.scott.senate.gov/) characterized it, crypto advocates created a super PAC that spent roughly \$40 million to tear down the [Ohio](https://www.ohio.gov/) senator, and that made the difference between winning and losing.

“Literally, the [crypto] industry put [Bernie Moreno (T-OH)](https://www.moreno.senate.gov/) in the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/), and he’s on the [Banking Committee](http://www.banking.senate.gov/public),” the [South Carolina Trumpian](https://www.scott.senate.gov/) said.

A month later, prominent crypto advocates are being credited with derailing a [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) nominee who was otherwise likely to be confirmed.
