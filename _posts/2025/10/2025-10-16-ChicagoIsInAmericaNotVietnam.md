## [Americans can’t grow numb to the terror Trump is inflicting on the streets of Chicago](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-ice-agents-violence-chicago-terror-numb-rcna238003)

*[ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) agents are wreaking absolute havoc, terrorizing legal residents, American citizens and everyone in between.*

By Chris Hayes

This is an adapted excerpt from the [Oct. 15](https://www.msnbc.com/all) episode of “All In with Chris Hayes.”

It may have dropped off the front pages a bit this week, but the [heavy-handed brutality](https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/-this-is-crazy-mika-shocked-by-ice-removing-two-women-from-car-near-chicago-school-249931333530) from [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement](https://www.ice.gov/) officers in cities like [Chicago](https://www.chicago.gov/) and elsewhere has continued every day.

We have seen [video after video](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/ice-agents-violent-video-arrests-trump-immigration-crackdown-rcna237373) of armed, militarized agents and police officers harassing demonstrators and grabbing folks off the street. They are wreaking absolute havoc among the residents of [Chicago](https://www.chicago.gov/), terrorizing legal residents, American citizens and everyone in between.

On Tuesday, [Chicago](https://www.chicago.gov/) residents were [tear-gassed](https://www.nbcchicago.com/investigations/tear-gas-released-on-chicago-crowd-as-border-patrol-describes-chase-crash-and-arrests/3838716/) after a crowd gathered in response to a collision between an [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) vehicle and another car. In a video of the incident, multiple cans of the gas are visible at the scene. It looks like an active war zone with militarized agents in gas masks.

At one point, a couple carrying a baby are seen fleeing the scene to avoid exposing the infant to the chemical agents deployed against the crowd. A voice can be heard telling them to “get the baby in the house.”

According to [Chicago](https://www.chicago.gov/) police, they were attempting to [de-escalate the situation](https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/14/us/chicago-ice-protesters-crash) after onlookers started throwing objects at agents. But the behavior exhibited in that video does not appear to be de-escalatory.

In fact, we’re not seeing a lot of de-escalatory behavior from [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) lately. Last week, a producer for a local news station was [detained by agents.](https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/10/14/wgn-tv-producer-ice-detention/) The [Homeland Security Department](https://www.dhs.gov/) claimed she was arrested for throwing objects at officers but, later that day, she was released without any criminal charges.

And remember that [Black Hawk helicopter raid](https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/10/05/congress-members-rally-south-shore-apartment-ice-raid) on a South Side apartment building in [Chicago](https://www.chicago.gov/)? The one where, according to witnesses, folks were forced out of their homes naked and children were zip-tied? [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) ransacked the building under the guise of hunting down gang members.

Initially, the [Homeland Security Department](https://www.dhs.gov/) claimed it arrested two suspected members of the gang Tren de Aragua. Now, on its own, that would make the apartment raid wildly disproportionate. But it gets even worse. According to [new reporting](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/trump-immigrants-violent-crime-chicago-illinois-ice-rcna237272) from [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) senior correspondent Jacob Soboroff, that number has already gone down to one.

The agency has also refused to say how it verified that gang affiliation. It is worth remembering that, in the past, this [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has labeled someone a gang member for having [an autism awareness tattoo.](https://www.msnbc.com/all-in/watch/-incredible-trump-admin-reportedly-deports-man-over-autism-awareness-tattoo-235625029616).

You do not have to take the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s excuses at face value. What we do know is that [Donald Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/donald-trump) is escalating his repression of the American people — and he’s doing it right out in the open. He wants you to grow numb to the terror they are inflicting on our streets. But Americans cannot give up the fight.
