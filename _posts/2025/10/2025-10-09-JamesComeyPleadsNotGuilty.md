*Former [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) personal lawyer [Lindsey Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) obtained the indictment sought by the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). Now she needs to prove the case.*

Oct. 8, 2025, 10:08 AM EDT
By [Jordan Rubin](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jordan-rubin-ncpn1301611)

[James Comey](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/james-comey-trump-immunity-ask-jordan-rcna235454) pleaded not guilty Wednesday [to criminal charges](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/james-comey-plea-arraignment-federal-indictment-rcna236198) that were demanded by [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and secured by one of his former personal lawyers, who has never prosecuted a case before. The [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) [installed Lindsey Halligan](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-lindsey-halligan-james-comey-indictment-rcna234122) to lead the [U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) after the previous head, Erik Siebert, was [forced out after he resisted](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-justice-department-fires-wrong-prosecutor-wrong-reason-rcna235424) charging [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/) and [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) [Attorney General](https://ag.ny.gov/) [Letitia James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james/), another political opponent [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [wants charged](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/top-prosecutor-trump-pressure-charge-new-york-ag-rcna235922).

The [federal indictment](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.582136/gov.uscourts.vaed.582136.1.0_12.pdf) on which the former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director was arraigned in a Virginia courtroom outside Washington on Wednesday is the product of a grand jury presentation [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) [made herself](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/trump-james-comey-indictment-us-attorney-lindsey-halligan-rcna233853) last month — over the objection of career prosecutors — as the statute of limitations window was closing. Further suggesting that her new colleagues think the case lacks merit is that [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) was the only lawyer for the government listed on [the docket](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/71459121/united-states-v-comey/) until Tuesday, when two federal prosecutors from North Carolina entered their appearances alongside her.

Grand jurors [rejected one](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.582136/gov.uscourts.vaed.582136.3.0_8.pdf) of the three counts [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) presented but approved two others: one for allegedly lying to [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) and another for allegedly obstructing [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/).

[Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/)’s theory of the case isn’t entirely clear from [the indictment](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/read-full-text-james-comey-indictment-pdf-rcna233818), which is somewhat vague and limited. But it centers on [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/)’s September 2020 congressional testimony over whether he authorized anyone at the bureau to be an anonymous source in news reports related to an [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) investigation. The indictment accuses him of falsely stating that he hadn’t granted such authorization.

[Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/) headed the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) when [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) took office in his first term and his 2016 campaign’s potential ties to [Russia](http://government.ru/) were under investigation. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) fired [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/) in 2017 [after Comey said he](https://www.npr.org/2017/06/07/531927032/comey-trump-asked-for-loyalty-wanted-him-to-let-flynn-investigation-go) refused to [pledge loyalty to the president](https://www.justice.gov/storage/report_volume2.pdf).
