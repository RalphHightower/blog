## [Trump approves disaster declarations for red states, as blue states go without](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-approves-disaster-declarations-red-states-blue-states-go-rcna239604)

*“[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) have politicized disaster relief,” one governor said, “and our communities are the ones who will pay the price.”*

Oct. 24, 2025, 12:28 PM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

It takes an awful lot for congressional [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s to express dissatisfaction with Donald [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his team, but the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has been [so slow](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/democrats-questions-dhs-buying-private-jets-used-kristi-noem-rcna238636) in approving disaster declarations that even [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) lawmakers aligned with the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) are [sick of it](https://www.notus.org/congress/kristi-noem-frustration-republicans-dhs-fema).

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [published an item](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115419577297297862) to his social media platform on Wednesday afternoon, announcing that he’d personally approved \$2.5 million in disaster aid for [Missouri](https://www.mo.gov/). Ordinarily, that wouldn’t have been especially notable as a national news story, but the context matters.

The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s online statement didn’t just announce the relief funding, it also emphasized the number of times he won [Missouri](https://www.mo.gov/)’s electoral votes, as if there were some kind of connection between his political support in the state and his eagerness to provide disaster aid. The [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) went on to reference the “incredible Patriots” in the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) stronghold.

Just one minute later, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) published [a follow-up item](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115419580763584285), touting his approval of \$15 million for [Nebraska](https://www.nebraska.gov/). The minute after that, he [added a third missive](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115419584805414647), announcing \$25 million for [Alaska](https://www.alaska.gov/) — “which I won BIG in 2016, 2020, and 2024,” he wrote.

The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s apparent eagerness to draw overt and direct connections between disaster relief funds and political considerations was ridiculous, but it was only part of a larger problem. [The Associated Press reported](https://apnews.com/article/fema-trump-disasters-alaska-maryland-illinois-2c7a90956c101db8fe281d669a9cbde2):

> *[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) approved major disaster declarations for [Alaska](https://www.alaska.gov/), [Nebraska](https://www.nebraska.gov/), [North Dakota](https://www.nd.gov/) and the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe late Wednesday, while denying requests from [Vermont](https://www.vermont.gov/), [Illinois](https://www.illinois.gov/) and [Maryland](https://www.maryland.gov/) and leaving other states still waiting for answers. ... The disaster declarations authorize the [Federal Emergency Management Agency](https://www.fema.gov/) to support recipients with federal financial assistance to repair public infrastructure damaged by disasters and, in some cases, provide survivors money for repairs and temporary housing.*

The [AP](https://apnews.com/)’s report added that the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) denied four requests, “including [Maryland](https://www.maryland.goov/)’s appeal for reconsideration after the state was denied a disaster declaration for May flooding that severely impacted the state’s two westernmost counties.”

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) lost [Maryland](https://www.maryland.goov/) by 29 points last fall.

The state’s [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [governor](https://governor.maryland.gov/Pages/home.aspx), [Wes Moore](https://governor.maryland.gov/leadership/Pages/governor.aspx), described the denial as “deeply frustrating,” adding in a written statement that “[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) have politicized disaster relief, and our communities are the ones who will pay the price.”

Around the same time, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) also denied a major disaster declaration for [Vermont](https://www.vermont.gov/) — a state he lost by 31 points — which suffered significant flooding damage in July.

It would be easier to see this as a coincidence if the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) had been otherwise evenhanded in dealing with red and blue states, but given [the obvious fact](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-house-targets-blue-states-democratic-senator-condemns-mafioso-ta-rcna235126) that [it](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/17/white-house-pauses-new-round-of-largely-blue-state-projects-00613875) has [not](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/14/us/trump-grants-democrat-districts-government-shutdown.html), it makes these latest decisions even more difficult to defend.

“*[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) seems to see [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/)-led states — and the people in them — less as constituents to which he has a set of larger obligations and more as enemies to be pacified and defeated,” [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/)’ [Jamelle Bouie recently argued](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/04/opinion/trump-responsible-president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)-job-military.html). “For [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), there is no whole people of the United States. There are only his people and his states.”*
