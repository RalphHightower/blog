## [Trump wants the IRS to investigate his foes. That won't play out the way he thinks.](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-irs-left-groups-investigation-shapley-illegal-rcna238684)

*[IRS](https://www.irs.gov/) employees should remember they don't have [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s [presidential](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) immunity.*

Oct. 21, 2025, 6:00 AM EDT
By [Ezra Reese](https://www.elias.law/team/ezra-reese), political law chair at [Elias Law Group LLP](https://www.elias.law/)

[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is committed to using every tool at his disposal to exact retribution on his political enemies, and now he has turned his attention to the [Internal Revenue Service](https://www.irs.gov/).

[The Wall Street Journal recently reported](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-irs-investigations-left-leaning-groups-democratic-donors-612a095e) that the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) is “preparing sweeping changes at the [IRS](https://www.irs.gov/) that would allow the agency to pursue criminal inquiries of left-leaning groups more easily, according to people familiar with the matter.” These changes, the [Journal](https://www.wsj.com/) reports, “are being driven by Gary Shapley, an adviser to [Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/) [Secretary Scott Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent),” and include revising the agency’s procedure handbook to diminish the role of lawyers from the [IRS](https://www.irs.gov/)’ chief counsel’s office.

> *That the second [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) would target groups by political affiliation is especially ironic given the actions of the first [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/).*

While Shapley briefly served as acting [IRS](https://www.irs.gov/) [Commissioner](https://www.irs.gov/about-irs/commissioner-scott-bessent), he is best known for overseeing the [IRS](https://www.irs.gov/)’s investigation into Hunter Biden. The changes are clearly designed to make investigations of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s political enemies easier; indeed, the article noted that he has already “ordered” the [IRS](https://www.irs.gov/) to investigate specific tax-exempt organizations that oppose him. As the political law chair at [Elias Law Group](https://www.elias.law/), I represent several tax-exempt organizations that could be inappropriately targeted if the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is able to fully weaponize the [IRS](https://www.irs.gov/). However, these changes won’t achieve the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s

Federal criminal law ([Internal Revenue Code Section 7217](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/7217)) bars the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), the [vice president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) and other [Cabinet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/) officials (except the [attorney general](https://www.justice.gov/) from “directly or indirectly” requesting an audit or investigation by the [IRS](https://www.irs.gov/). While the [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) recently granted the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) presumptive immunity from prosecution for official actions, it is doubtful that this immunity would extend to the flagrant violation of a law that specifically applies to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).

Perhaps more importantly, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s immunity does not extend to those aiding him. Section 7217 also requires[IRS](https://www.irs.gov/) employees to report improper requests to the [Treasury Department](https://home.treasury.gov/)’s [Inspector General](https://oig.treasury.gov/), or risk hefty fines or up to 5 years in prison. Shapley may be willing to flout this law, but will other civil servants at the [IRS](https://www.irs.gov/) assume that much personal risk? Will they enable baseless investigations of [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s political opponents, particularly when the 5-year statute of limitations lasts far beyond his second term?

Shapley and any [IRS](https://www.irs.gov/) employees aiding him in his efforts would also face their own criminal exposure. Any federal employee that intentionally discriminates against Americans for their political views could be violating a number of criminal statutes, including [Sections 241](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/241) and [242 of Title 18 of the United States Code](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/242). Another law ([Internal Revenue Code Section 7214](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/7214)) specifically applies to “revenue officers or agents” who engage in “willful oppression under color of law” — punishments include firing, fines and prison time. For these laws as well, the statute of limitations is 5 years and would extend into a subsequent [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/).

That the second [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) would target groups by political affiliation is especially ironic given the actions of the first [Trump](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/). In 2013, Lois Lerner, then the director of the Exempt Organizations Unit, [admitted that IRS employees had given extra scrutiny](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/irs-admits-targeting-conservatives-for-tax-scrutiny-in-2012-election/2013/05/10/3b6a0ada-b987-11e2-92f3-f291801936b8_story.html) to groups with “tea party” or “patriot” in their names that had applied for tax-exempt status. The resulting firestorm resulted in [Lerner’s resignation,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/lois-lerner-ousted-from-irs-volunteers-to-screen-grant-applications-in-montgomery-co/2013/10/18/ca8c1d3a-3771-11e3-80c6-7e6dd8d22d8f_story.html), departures of other top officials, [congressional inquiries](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/irs-chief-tells-house-panel-he-does-not-deserve-impeachment-n652031) and [multiple lawsuits](https://nonprofitquarterly.org/irs-settles-last-nonprofit-targeting-scandal-case/).

> *Shapley reportedly has been very clear about his intentions.*

In 2017, the first Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) settled one of those lawsuits with an apology and [payment of $3.5 million](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/aug/9/judge-approves-35-million-settlement-irs-tea-party/). In announcing the settlement, [Attorney General Jeff Sessions said](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/attorney-general-jeff-sessions-announces-department-justice-has-settled-plaintiff-groups) said, “It is improper for the [IRS](https://www.irs.gov/) to single out groups for different treatment based on their names or ideological positions. Any entitlement to tax exemption should be based on the activities of the organization and whether they fulfill requirements of the law, not the policy positions adopted by members or the name chosen to reflect those views.”

The [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) declined to pursue criminal charges under these laws only because they could not prove that officials intended to break the law and [found that in that case](https://static.politico.com/5e/cc/575deb8447a1ae21270d7481a108/justice-department-letter-declining-to-charge-lois-lerner.pdf) “mismanagement, poor judgment, and institutional inertia” were the more likely culprits. Shapley, on the other hand, reportedly has been very clear about his intentions. According to the [Journal](https://www.wsj.com/), he “has been putting together a list of donors and groups he believes [IRS](https://www.irs.gov/) investigators should look at. Among those on the list are the billionaire Democratic donor George Soros and his affiliated groups, according to a senior [IRS](https://www.irs.gov/) official and another person briefed on the list.”

As a veteran of the [IRS](https://www.irs.gov/)’s criminal investigative division, Shapley is fully aware of the law, meaning if he and any colleagues pursue these investigations, arguing ignorance would be a much more difficult sell in court.

Ultimately, [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and members of his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) cannot weaponize the [IRS](https://www.irs.gov/) against the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s enemies without creating significant legal peril for themselves and those around them. Those hoping to shelter in recent [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov%) rulings or this [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s support for retribution should reconsider how their actions will be seen under a future [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) that might not be so willing to ignore the rule of law.
