## [Pam Bondi’s boasts about the ‘end’ of weaponization suddenly look a lot more preposterous](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/pam-bondis-boasts-end-weaponization-suddenly-look-lot-preposterous-rcna236855)

*If [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) genuinely believes she and the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) have somehow “ended” government weaponization, I have some very bad news for the [attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/).*

Oct. 10, 2025, 9:48 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

When [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) sat down with [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/)’ [Sean Hannity](https://www.foxnews.com/person/h/sean-hannity) two weeks ago, the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) lawyer repeated a familiar talking point. “[Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is in office, and the weaponization has ended,” [she boasted](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/pam-bondi-claims-weaponization-ended-141332238.html). The [Floridian](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) [repeated the line](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3m24xo4ce6g2f) on [Faux Business](https://www.foxnews.com/) a few days later.

During [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/)’s appearance before the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Judiciary Committee](http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/) this week, she again emphasized the line, telling the panel’s members that one of her principal priorities is “to end the weaponization of justice” — a goal the [attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) claimed she’d achieved.

There was, of course, a problem with the premise of [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/)’s boasts: One cannot end something that never started. It is an accepted fact in [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) circles that the federal government in general, and the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) in specific, was weaponized during the [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) era, but there’s never been any evidence to bolster the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/)’s many conspiracy theories.

But as important as that detail remains, there’s an equally problematic element to [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/)’s incessant boasts: The idea that government weaponization came to a sudden and remarkable end upon [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s return to power is obviously preposterous. [The New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/07/us/politics/trump-enemies-justice-department-investigations.html):

> *From the moment [Donald J. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) began his campaign to return to the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), he has expressed a clear desire to seek vengeance against his perceived enemies. In the last few weeks, the pressure campaign has intensified with two of his foes — [James Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/) and [Letitia James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james/) — now indicted. Back in power, [Mr. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has weaponized the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) to his own ends, critics say, in a more direct manner than any [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) since the [Nixon](https://www.nixonlibrary.gov/) era.*

Of course, it’s not just “critics” who’ve made the case. It’s also reality.

This isn’t an especially close call.

In recent weeks, and in response to [a corrupt presidential directive](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-directive-ag-bondi-seen-impeachment-level-scandal-rcna232888), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) secured [a highly dubious criminal indictment](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-orchestrates-james-comey-indictment-fbi-justice-corruption-rcna233857) against one of the [president](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s favorite targets, and then secured another [highly dubious criminal indictment](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/one-thing-letitia-james-james-comey-indictments-common-rcna236837) against one of the president’s other favorite targets.

But that’s just the start. [Team Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is also investigating [Fani Willis](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/fani-willis-faces-subpoena-trumps-justice-department-joining-unsettlin-rcna234429), the [Georgia](https://www.georgia.gov/) [district attorney](https://fultoncountyga.gov/Inside-Fulton-County/Fulton-County-Departments/District-Attorney/DA-Executive-Team/Fani-Willis) who tried to hold the president accountable for his post-2020-election conduct. And [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Adam Schiff](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/adam-schiff-tries-turn-tables-pushes-investigation-fhfas-pulte-rcna230346) of [California](https://www.ca.gov/). And former [CIA](https://www.cia.gov/) Director [John Brennan](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/doj-says-comey-brennan-perceived-trump-foes-are-criminal-investigation-rcna217731) (a paid contributor to MSNBC). And former [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) National Security Adviser John Bolton. And even former [President Joe Biden](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-targets-biden-new-investigation-republican-endgame-comes-focus-rcna211131).

And did I mention that, in recent months, a [Democratic mayor](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/newark-mayor-ras-baraka-sues-alina-habba-ice-arrest-rcna210629), a [Democratic U.S. House member](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/rep-lamonica-mciver-arrested-ice-new-jersey-alina-habba-rcna207334), the [staffer](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/31/nyregion/nadler-aide-handcuffed-federal-agents.html) of a different [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [U.S. House](https://www.house.gov=) member, [sitting judge](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/fbi-arrests-judge-wisconsin-ag-pam-bondi-directs-new-threats-judiciary-rcna203061) and a labor leader have all been criminally charged, detained or taken into custody by [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) officials? Because all of that happened, too.

In case that weren’t quite enough, the [Times](https://www.nytimes.com/)’ report noted that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/), which is currently led by [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s former personal lawyers, “has fired dozens of career prosecutors, many of whom had worked on cases involving [Mr. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). And the [president](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his allies have targeted or pushed out several U.S. attorneys as he seeks quick movement on cases involving a number of his political adversaries.”

If [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) believes she and the president have somehow “ended” people in power using the government as a political weapon, I have some very bad news for the [attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/).
