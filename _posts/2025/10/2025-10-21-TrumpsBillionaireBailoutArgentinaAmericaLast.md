## [Trump’s deal with Argentina shows just how hollow his ‘America First’ slogan has become](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-argentina-bailout-milei-america-first-rcna238725)

*With the government paralyzed and Americans’ pocketbooks reeling, the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is giving a $20 billion bailout to an ideological ally of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and [Elon Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk/).*

Oct. 21, 2025, 6:00 AM EDT
By [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Nydia Velázquez (D-NY7)](https://velazquez.house.gov/)

In January, [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) opened [his inaugural address](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-inauguration-speech-2025-address-full-transcript-rcna188365) by promising to “put [America first](https://www.msnbc.com/the-weekend-primetime/watch/trump-faces-backlash-from-allies-for-abandoning-america-first-250171461940)” daily and usher in a new golden age for American families. Ten months in, Americans are still waiting for the golden age to arrive and reeling from [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) policies that have actively made their lives worse.

His [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s [signature legislation](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/medicaid-cuts-big-beautiful-bill-deaths-rcna215575) delivers the largest [Medicaid](https://www.medicaid.gov/) cuts in U.S. history, threatening to strip coverage from 15 million people while taking food assistance from children, seniors, and people with disabilities. His erratic trade policy has worsened the cost-of-living crisis, amounting to an average [\$1,300 tax increase](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/trump-tariffs-trade-war/__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!pDA-qBoXJPC40BVhQpX5Yjzp5b6DHWONJylPU217q4tPsZziCey7jHd5oJTo7aeLeWT0GpIOjQiNIqHQxV0gp6uJfRiWaRNiK8KHQPisk-xH$) per household this year. And as the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) shutdown drags on, essential services are halted and paychecks paused for hundreds of thousands of federal workers.

> *Even [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) knows this deal has nothing to do with helping Americans and everything to do with propping up a political ally.*

Now, with government operations paralyzed and Americans’ pocketbooks reeling, the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has made the extraordinary decision to move forward with a \$20 billion bailout for [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/). [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s and [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)s alike are asking what, exactly, is “America First” about sending billions of U.S. dollars abroad while Americans are suffering at home. The irony is especially sharp for U.S. farmers, who have been shut out of [China](https://www.gov.cn/)’s soybean market because of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s trade war — just as [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/) moves in to fill that gap. While [Washington](https://dc.gov/) props up [Buenos Aires](https://buenosaires.gob.ar/inicio/), small-farm bankruptcies here have climbed to a five-year high.

During a [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) meeting with [Argentine](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/) [President Javier Milei](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/presidencia) last week, [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) provided the answer. Asked how the bailout would help the U.S., [he replied](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/south-america/trump-threatens-pull-support-argentina-politics-move-leftward-rcna237704), “Just helping a great philosophy take over a great country.”

Even [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) knows this deal has nothing to do with helping Americans and everything to do with propping up a political ally.

[Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/) [Secretary Scott Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) [has called Argentina](https://x.com/SecScottBessent/status/1970107351912075454) a “systemically important ally,” but its real importance to this [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) is political rather than economic.

[President Milei](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/presidencia) has styled himself as an ideological cousin of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and [Elon Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk/), though his campaign of extreme austerity came first. At the [Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC)](https://www.cpac.org/) in [Washington, D.C.](https://dc.gov/), this February, [Milei](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/presidencia) presented [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk/) with a chainsaw to highlight the links between [Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk/)’s [Department of Government Efficiency](https://doge.gov/), or [DOGE](https://doge.gov/), and [Milei](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/presidencia)’s austerity campaign in [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/). Like [DOGE](https://doge.gov/), [Milei](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/presidencia)’s program was billed as a war on waste, but in practice, it became a showy slashing spree that gutted public services while doing little to fix [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/)’s deeper economic problems.

[Milei](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/presidencia)’s program [has driven household spending on utilities up](https://economicas.uba.ar/iiep/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/INFORME-TARIFAS-Y-SUBSIDIOS-JULIO-2024.pdf) up from 6% to 15%, according to a report from the [University of Buenos Aires](https://www.uba.ar/), and pushed the country to the brink of a currency crisis.

This situation has left many [Argentine](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/)s fed up with the [Milei](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/presidencia) political agenda, causing his party to suffer a stunning loss in a [Buenos Aires provincial election](https://apnews.com/article/argentina-election-javier-milei-cristina-fernandez-peronism-fecba6d106eb2c0f2440e9fca298e470) in September. With more potential losses looming in a pivotal [Argentine](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/) midterm election, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) decided to step in to stop the bleeding. The political motive behind the bailout was made crystal clear last week when [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said the U.S. is “not going to waste our time” if [Milei](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/presidencia)’s coalition did not prevail in November.

That motivation should alarm every taxpayer. Using U.S. funds to influence a foreign election is a glaring misuse of public money. The fact that [Milei](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/presidencia)’s government is [embroiled in numerous alleged corruption scandals](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/27/javier-milei-sister-argentina-alleged-kickbacks) makes the bailout even more concerning.

> *[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s promise to put America first has become a hollow slogan.*

Even the structure of the bailout raises red flags. The [Treasury Department](https://home.treasury.gov/) is utilizing the [Exchange Stabilization Fund](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/international/exchange-stabilization-fund), or [ESF](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/international/exchange-stabilization-fund), to extend a massive line of credit without any conditionality or immediate congressional oversight. Such intervention is almost without precedent. Historically, deployment of the [ESF](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/international/exchange-stabilization-fund) — such as for [Mexico](https://www.gob.mx/) in 1995 and Asian economies in 1997 — came with clear repayment terms and transparency requirements to protect American taxpayers. The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has disclosed no such safeguards here.

This is important, as [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/)’s capacity to repay the loan is highly uncertain. Its sovereign bonds are rated below investment grade across the board. Investors consider them a speculative gamble, reflecting just how precarious [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/)’s finances have become. Meanwhile, the government has been burning through billions in reserves to prop up an overvalued exchange rate — a strategy that cannot last, no matter how much it borrows from the United States or other institutions. The [Treasury Department](https://home.treasury.gov/) owes the public an explanation of what safeguards or repayment terms exist to protect U.S. taxpayers from loss.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s promise to put America first has become a hollow slogan. At home, he’s dismantling the government programs that working families rely on. Abroad, he’s using taxpayer dollars on a risky bailout of a foreign government that shares his politics. If this is his idea of America first, Americans deserve far better.
