Oct. 27, 2025, 8:00 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

A month ago, [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) targeted his former handpicked [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director, [Christopher Wray](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/christopher-wray), in a new and creative way. As part of a weird and discredited conspiracy theory, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [spun a ridiculous tale](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/s-not-just-comey-trump-eyes-case-chris-wray-fbi-director-ousted-rcna234393) about [Wray](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/christopher-wray) having lied about imaginary [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) agents who participated in the [Jan. 6 attack]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}).

Though [none of this made any sense](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/s-not-just-comey-trump-eyes-case-chris-wray-fbi-director-ousted-rcna234393), the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [told NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-weighs-whether-doj-investigate-former-fbi-director-christopher-w-rcna234225) a day later that he believed [Wray](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/christopher-wray) engaged in “inappropriate” behavior during his tenure at the bureau and said he “would think” the [Justice Department](https"//www.justice.gov/) is investigating him.

“I would imagine. I would certainly imagine. I would think they are doing that,” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said when he was asked whether the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) should investigate [Wray](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/christopher-wray).

A month later, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) was even less subtle. [The New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/10/24/us/trump-canada-news/da7382fd-81a7-59a6-ab4d-c2a22f8d824a?smid=url-share):

> *[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) called for prosecution of former [Attorney General Merrick Garland](https://www.justice.gov/ag/bio/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland) and former F.B.I. Director [Christopher Wray](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/christopher-wray), among others, in a rant on his social media platform on Friday night — replete with misinformation and debunked lies about the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf). [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), seizing on the release of documents showing the [Biden](https;//bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) Justice Department requested metadata on calls between the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) senators during the investigation into [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s attempt to overturn the election, claimed without evidence that the department ‘taped’ the calls.*

For reasons unknown, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), while presumably focused on his trip to Asia, published [an absurd online tirade](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115432378654253078) about newly disclosed “documents” that don’t appear to exist. As part of the same harangue, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) claimed there’s now “conclusive” evidence against [Wray](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/christopher-wray), [former special counsel Jack Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith), former [Attorney General Merrick Garland](https://www.justice.gov/ag/bio/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland) and former Deputy Attorney General [Lisa Monaco](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisa-monaco-345154350/).

According to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), the quartet “spied on” members of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) (which never happened in reality), “taped” the lawmakers’ phone calls (which also never happened in reality) and “cheated and rigged the [2020 Presidenial Election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf)” (which was not rigged).

The post concluded, “These Radical Left Lunatics should be prosecuted for their illegal and highly unethical behavior!”

None of these people are “radical left lunatics”; three of the four weren’t in office on Election Day 2020 and couldn’t have “rigged” anything; and there is literally no evidence of any of them engaging in “illegal” or “unethical” behavior.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s hysterics, in other words, reflect the perspective of someone living in an alternate reality.

But while the broader conversation about the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s cognitive state continues to have merit, what I cared most about was his “should be prosecuted” phrase.

Nine days before publishing this nonsense, during an event in the [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), [the president pressed](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-pitches-justice-dept-fbi-leaders-newly-expanded-enemies-list-rcna237944) the nation’s three most powerful federal law enforcement officials — the incumbent attorney general, the deputy attorney general and the director of the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) — [to prosecute](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-pitches-justice-dept-fbi-leaders-newly-expanded-enemies-list-rcna237944) [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith), [Monaco](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisa-monaco-345154350/) and former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) general counsel Andrew Weissmann.

For good measure, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) soon after [added](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3m3b2u2dopo2t), in reference to Sen. [Adam Schiff (D-CA)](https://www.schiff.senate.gov/), “I hope they’re looking at ‘Shifty’ Schiff. I hope they’re looking at all these people,” before also endorsing a federal investigation [into his election defeat in Georgia](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3m3b3tmsdhr2n) five years ago.

Weeks earlier, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) posted an item to his online platform that directed [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) [to go after three of the president’s perceived political enemies](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-directive-ag-bondi-seen-impeachment-level-scandal-rcna232888), whom he said were “[guilty as hell](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-directive-ag-bondi-seen-impeachment-level-scandal-rcna232888)” of unidentified crimes.

As is always the case, while focusing on those in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), it’s important to watch what they do, not just what they say. The trouble in this instance, however, is that officials in [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) have a scandalous habit of launching investigations — and in some cases, even securing dubious indictments — [targeting those on the president’s growing enemies list](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/one-thing-letitia-james-james-comey-indictments-common-rcna236837).

In other words, when [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) barks orders about those he wants to see prosecuted, there’s a team of [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)ial appointees who take these outlandish directives seriously, which makes them harder to simply brush off as meaningless palaver.
