## [Jack Smith ready to respond to GOP questions, but he wants the public to see his answers](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jack-smith-ready-respond-gop-questions-wants-public-see-answers-rcna239538)

*Last week, [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) lawmakers tried to go on the offensive against the former special counsel. This week, he turned the tables and called their bluff.*

Oct. 24, 2025, 8:55 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

More than 10 months after then-special counsel [Jack Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith/) [grudgingly stepped down](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/jack-smith-resigns-justice-department-trump-rcna187281) — the [2024 election results](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/2024presgeresults.pdf) [derailed his criminal cases](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/sen-mike-lee-doesnt-understand-jack-smiths-cases-rcna182012) against [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) — the prosecutor remains a popular target for [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s’ ire.

The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) continues to [peddle baseless attacks](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/january-6-fbi-republican-conspiracy-theory-rcna236367) against the former special counsel; the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) [continues](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/kash-patel-fires-yet-another-group-fbi-agents-cause-shutters-corruptio-rcna236490) to [push out](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/doj-fires-career-prosecutors-team-trumps-revenge-tour-continues-rcna189586?icid=previouspost_bot) officials who worked with [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith/); and assorted [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) voices continue to go after [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith/) with [unhinged and easily discredited](https://www.thedailybeast.com/eric-trump-goes-full-tin-full-hat-in-rant-against-his-dads-nemesis/) conspiracy theories.

As for developments on Capitol Hill, GOP lawmakers remain eager to treat [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith/) like a punching bag. [Rep](https://www.house.gov/) [Michael Rulli (T-OH6](https://rulli.house.gov/) this week [baselessly accused](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3m3uifejwj22a) accused the prosecutor of acts that he said bordered on “treason”; [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Marsha Blackburn (T-TN)](https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/) [referred Smith to the Justice Department](https://thehill.com/homenews/5561372-marsha-blackburn-jack-smith-doj-probe/) for a misconduct investigation, based on [misguided allegations](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/us/politics/jack-smith-phone-records-republicans.html) the Tennessee [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [did not appear to understand](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/january-6-fbi-republican-conspiracy-theory-rcna236367); and several GOP members have even [pushed for Smith’s disbarment](https://www.axios.com/2025/10/17/jack-smith-arctic-frost-marsha-blackburn-letter-doj).

To date, no [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) official has produced any evidence of [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith/) doing anything wrong. The party’s hysterics continue anyway.

Most recently, [House Judiciary Committee](http://judiciary.house.gov/) [Chairman](http://judiciary.house.gov/the-committee/the-chairman) [Jim Jordan (T-OH4)](https://jordan.house.gov/) [sent a letter](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/10/14/congress/jordan-wants-jack-smith-testimony-00607878) to the former special counsel last week to demand his closed-door testimony. This week, [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith/) said he’s ready to respond to GOP questions — but he wants the public to see his answers. [The New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/10/23/us/trump-news/07e9c340-87d9-5a84-95b7-327684ced27e?smid=url-share):

> *[Jack Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith/), the former special counsel who twice indicted [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), is asking for a public hearing following a summons from House [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s to testify about his investigations. [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith/)’s lawyers — citing ‘many mischaracterizations’ made about his work — want to avoid a closed-door interview.*

The Times’ report, which has been independently verified by MSNBC, added that [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s on Capitol Hill “have privately been wary about having him appear in public, concerned he will undercut the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s claims of innocence.”

Those concerns, of course, give away the game.

As we’ve [discussed](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-seek-jack-smiths-testimony-former-special-counsel-plenty-s-rcna237737), [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith/) is an experienced, credible and capable prosecutor, who’s familiar with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s criminal cases at a granular level. The more [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s drag him back into the spotlight, the more [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith/) will be positioned to remind the public not only of the variety of alleged presidential felonies, but also of evidence the party would probably prefer to forget.

In other words, Jordan and his GOP colleagues sounded last week like they were going on the offensive against [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith/), but now it’s [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith/) who’s calling their bluff. He’s not the one who needs to worry; they are.

“You want to talk?” the former special counsel effectively said. “Great. I have quite a bit to say. Let’s have a public conversation.”

[Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s have not yet said whether they’ll allow the transparency [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith/) clearly wants, although for the record, there’s no reason this Q&A would have to be held behind closed doors. Watch this space.
