## [Speaker Johnson condemns congressional Democrats as ‘legislative terrorists’](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/speaker-johnson-condemns-congressional-democrats-legislative-terrorist-rcna239323)

*After expressing concerns about the dangers of incendiary political rhetoric, [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/)’ top [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) referred to [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)s as “legislative terrorists.”*

Oct. 23, 2025, 9:49 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

On Jan. 6, 2021, a New York man named Christopher Moynihan was one of the first rioters to break into the U.S. Capitol. He was later sentenced to 21 months in prison. Moynihan did not, however, serve his full term behind bars, because he was one of the many criminals [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) pardoned just hours after returning to power earlier this year.

Nine months after receiving the presidential reprieve, Moynihan made headlines again. On Tuesday morning, the public learned that the pardoned rioter [had been arrested](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/pardoned-jan-6-rioter-charged-threatening-hakeem-jeffries-adding-patte-rcna238891) after allegedly threatening to assassinate [House](https://www.house.gov/,) [Minority Leader](https://www.majorityleader.gov/) [Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY8)](https://jeffries.house.gov/)
According to the evidence presented by local prosecutors, [the man texted](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/pardoned-jan-6-rioter-charged-threatening-hakeem-jeffries-adding-patte-rcna238891) in reference to the [New York Democratic congressman](https://jeffries.house.gov/), “I cannot allow this terrorist to live.”

Hours after these revelations came to light, a reporter asked [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Speaker](https://speaker.house.gov/) [Mike Johnson (T-LA4)](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) for his reaction to the developments. The [Louisiana Republican](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/ b) said [he knew very little](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3m3pkxrl5js2e) about the story ([a familiar posture](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/mike-johnson-excuses-trump-investigations-congress-rcna239144) for the [GOP leader](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) before he [ultimately blamed “the left”](https://bsky.app/profile/thebulwark.com/post/3m3pmzb2qgn2v) for having cultivated an “assassination culture.” (When a [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) is targeted with violence, it’s the left’s fault, and when a [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) is targeted, it’s also the left’s fault.)

One day later, the [House speaker](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) sat down with [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/)’s [Kaitlan Collins](https://www.cnn.com/profiles/kaitlan-collins#about) to talk about the ongoing government shutdown.

“We will not negotiate with legislative terrorists,” [Johnson said](https://transcripts.cnn.com/show/skc/date/2025-10-22/segment/01), referring to congressional [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)s.

In other words, on Tuesday, Americans learned of an alleged would-be assassin who described a [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) leader as a “terrorist.” The next day, the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [House speaker](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) thought it’d be a good idea to appear on national television and describe [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) leaders as “legislative terrorists.”

In the wake of the shooting death of conservative activist [Charlie Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/), a great many [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) officials — including [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) — eagerly drew a connection between inflammatory rhetoric and political violence. To hear these [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) tell it, the more that prominent political voices use provocative language, the more dangerous the conditions for violence become.

In the aftermath of those arguments, [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) published an online item featuring the images of [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) leaders, describing them as belonging to “the party of “[hate, evil, and Satan](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-pushes-new-label-democrats-party-hate-evil-satan-rcna235479).” Now that has been followed by the [House speaker](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) telling a national television audience that [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) leaders are “legislative terrorists” one day after the public learned of a would-be assassin who described a [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) leader as a “terrorist.”

Evidently, one party is allowed to use inflammatory rhetoric and the other is not?
