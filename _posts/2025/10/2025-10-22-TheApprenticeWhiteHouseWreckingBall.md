title: "The Apprentice: White House – Wrecking Ball"
---

I called the first season of [Trump’s](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) presidency, "The Apprentice: White House". November 11, 2024, I needed a title for his second presidency. Because of his intentions to destroy the federal government, I thought of him using a wrecking ball. I didn't think that it would be literally.

Jen Psaki, MSNBC Host and Former White House Press Secretary along with Cornell Belcher, MSNBC Political Analyst join Nicolle Wallace on Deadline White House with reaction to the images coming from the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) with [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com%) ordering the demolition of the entire [East Wing of the White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) for the purpose of building a 90,000 square foot ball room and how the destruction of the people's house is symbolic of how he views the Presidency.

*[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s critics have long accused him of being responsible for making a mess at the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). Those assessments have now become literal.*

By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

In 1998, the late David Broder criticized [Bill Clinton](https://clintonwhitehouse2.archives.gov/) [in a memorable way](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1998/11/02/not-in-their-back-yard-in-washington-that-letdown-feeling/545022ba-3717-4690-bfe7-9d5657b007c4/). “He came in here and he trashed the place — and it’s not his place,” the longtime [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) columnist said of the [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [president](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).

Broder, of course, was being metaphorical about [Clinton](https://clintonwhitehouse2.archives.gov/) and his impact at the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), but a generation later, the incumbent [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [president](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is actually trashing the place. [The Washington Post reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/20/white-house-begins-demolishing-east-wing-facade-build-trumps-ballroom/):

> *Demolition crews on Monday began tearing down part of the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) to build [President](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s long-desired ballroom despite his pledge that construction of the $250 million addition wouldn’t ‘interfere’ with the existing building. Construction teams were demolishing a portion of the [East Wing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), with a backhoe ripping through the structure, according to a photo shared with [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) and two people who witnessed the activity and spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe it.*

To be sure, when it comes to altering the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), it’s been a busy year for the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) incumbent. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) decided, for example, to [pave the Rose Garden](https://apnews.com/photo-gallery/trump-rose-garden-paved-over-photo-gallery-732b9521b69c10c12ce448f12e27401c). He’s taken a borderline-unhealthy interest in [interior decorating](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-struggles-governing-details-remains-focused-interior-decorating-rcna217809), including bringing in his “gold guy” to [add gold finishes](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-white-house-oval-office-gold-touches-6018016d)to just about everything in the [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). He installed a flagpole that the [president](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [seemed awfully excited about](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/06/20/trump-iran-war-flagpoles/). He even boasted about [“ripping” apart the tile](https://people.com/trump-says-he-ripped-apart-section-of-white-house-residence-and-installed-marble-11831030) in the Lincoln bathroom.

But destroying parts of the [East Wing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), as part of an effort to build a giant ballroom, took this campaign to a breathtaking new level.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s critics have long accused him of being responsible for making a mess at the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). Those assessments have now become literal.

When the [president](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) signed an executive order in July, related to the construction of a ballroom, he made a rather specific promise. “It won’t interfere with the current building,” he said. “It won’t be. It’ll be near it but not touching it — and pays total respect to the existing building, which I’m the biggest fan of. It’s my favorite. It’s my favorite place. I love it.”

As is too often the case, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was lying, though he tried to wiggle out of his vow after the demolition got underway: By way of his social media platform, the [Republican claimed](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115408594704490513) the [East Wing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is “completely separate from the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) itself.”

In other words, the [president](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wants the public to believe that the [East Wing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) of the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) isn’t actually part of the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), despite reality.

In 2009, [Republicans whined](https://washingtonmonthly.com/2009/02/06/andy-cards-fashion-preoccupation/) that [Barack Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) was being disrespectful to the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and its institutional traditions because he was photographed not wearing a jacket in the [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). Sixteen years later, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) brought in a crew to start destroying the [East Wing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).

The symbolic significance is difficult to miss: An authoritarian [president](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), acting at his own discretion, ignored his earlier vow and starting tearing down part of [The People’s House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) — not because it was necessary, but because he has decided he wants a fancy ballroom to host parties for the elite.

All of this, of course, is predicated on [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s apparent assumption that the [[White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is his house. He’s not a temporary steward, hired to lead; he’s a power-hungry owner, who decided the [presidential](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) mansion did not meet his tacky standards.

If [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s critics had predicted this during the 2024 campaign, the right would’ve accused them of being hysterical. And yet, here we are.
