[María Corina Machado](https://www.facebook.com/mariacorinaya), a Venezuelan politician, has won the [2025 Nobel Peace Prize](https://www.nobelpeaceprize.org/), the award’s committee announced Friday. [Machado](https://www.facebook.com/mariacorinaya) is a [democracy advocate and opposition leader](https://www.msnbc.com/jose-diaz-balart/watch/-campaign-of-terror-venezuelan-opposition-leader-speaks-out-about-maduro-refusing-to-cede-power-217315909625) who has built a powerful social movement despite the brutal [authoritarian tactics](https://www.msnbc.com/jose-diaz-balart/watch/maduro-regime-has-no-legitimacy-sen-cardin-speaks-with-opposition-leader-maria-corina-machado-219297861591) of President Nicolás Maduro.

The Norwegian Nobel Committee said [Machado earned the honor due to](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/2025/press-release/) “her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy," calling [Machado](https://www.facebook.com/mariacorinaya) "one of the most extraordinary examples of civilian courage in Latin America in recent times."

The committee cited [Machado](https://www.facebook.com/mariacorinaya)'s ability to organize various opposition factions, particularly around last year's presidential election. Volunteer poll watchers provided tallies showing the [Machado](https://www.facebook.com/mariacorinaya)-backed candidate had defeated Maduro, who refused to accept those results and is still in power.

"Despite serious threats against her life, she has remained in the country, a choice that has inspired millions of people," the committee wrote of [Machado](https://www.facebook.com/mariacorinaya), who now lives in hiding.

The [Norwegian Nobel Committee](https://www.nobelprize.org/about/the-norwegian-nobel-committee/) said [Machado](https://www.facebook.com/mariacorinaya) earned the honor due to “her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy."

Past recipients include Nihon Hidankyo, a Japanese organization of atomic bomb survivors, “for its efforts to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons” in 2024; Yasser Arafat, Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin in 1994; Henry Kissinger and Le Duc Tho in 1973; and Martin Luther King Jr. in 1964.

The [Nobel Prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/), first awarded in 1901, is named for Swedish inventor and entrepreneur Alfred Nobel, who left his fortune to recognize extraordinary contributions to humankind. The prize has six categories: physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature, peace and economic sciences.

Despite his nomination by [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu](https://apnews.com/article/explaining-netanyahu-trump-nobel-prize-nomination-bb3b0338b85226694ab7064b50f978c8) ([among](https://tenney.house.gov/media/press-releases/congresswoman-tenney-urges-nobel-committee-award-peace-prize-president-donald) [others](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-nominate-trump-nobel-peace-prize-rcna214246)) — and having repeatedly expressed his wish to be recognized for diplomacy — [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/,) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) did not come away the winner. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [said in September](https://thehill.com/video/trump-it-would-be-%e2%80%98an-insult-to-our-country%e2%80%99-if-he-doesn%e2%80%99t-get-nobel-peace-prize/11123610/) that if he didn’t win for his efforts ending foreign conflicts, “it’ll be a big insult to our country, I will tell you that.” Four U.S. presidents have won the [Nobel Peace Prize](https://www.nobelpeaceprize.org/): Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, [Jimmy Carter](https://www.jimmycarterlibrary.gov/jimmy-carter-presidential-library-and-museum) and [Barack Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/).
