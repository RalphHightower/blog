## [Trump’s clown car Cabinet is key to his retribution campaign](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-retribution-campaign-clown-car-cabinet-rcna240811)

*The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s [Cabinet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/) members weren’t chosen for their qualifications — they were chosen because they would be his loyal foot soldiers.*

Oct. 30, 2025, 3:52 PM EDT
By [Jen Psaki](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jen-psaki-ncpn1300286)

This is an adapted excerpt from the [Oct. 29](https://www.msnbc.com/jen-psaki) episode of “The Briefing with Jen Psaki.”

Typically, when people talk about [Donald Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/donald-trump)’s retribution campaign, they talk about his pressure to bring criminal charges against people such as [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Adam Schiff](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/watch/breaking-prosecutors-recently-told-doj-there-is-not-enough-evidence-to-prosecute-sen-adam-schiff-250495045896) of [California](https://www.ca.gov/), [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) [Attorney General](https://ag.ny.gov/) [Letitia James](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/comey-james-lindsey-halligan-appointment-rcna240482), former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Director](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/) [James Comey](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/james-comey-amicus-brief-hungary-turkey-venezeula-rcna240340) and [former special counsel](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) [Jack Smith](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/jack-smith-classified-documents-florida-aileen-cannon-rcna240017).

Those are definitely glaring examples of [Trump’s revenge tour](https://www.msnbc.com/the-weeknight/watch/-there-is-no-limit-ex-dhs-official-warns-trump-s-whole-of-government-revenge-tour-won-t-stop-250422853897), but the retribution campaign goes far beyond just trying to get current and former public officials thrown in jail.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is [deploying federal troops](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/scotus-set-rule-national-guard-deployment-chicago-nationwide-implicati-rcna239100) to the streets of [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/)-led cities in what appears to be an attempt to punish voters in places where he got the least support. Just this week, he [threatened to send troops into even more cities](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/10/28/trump-national-guard-deployment-us-cities/86942893007/). On Wednesday, [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/) reported the [Pentagon](https://www.jcs.mil/) is [establishing a “quick reaction force”](https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/pentagon-orders-national-guard-to-establish-quick-reaction-forces-for-civil-unrest-riots-f602b193?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqeINQzCjcUEjO2eHKLcH10RQhgrNM4EOyC800Lk1RMfK20xYkxhnGvsxBNHGQ0%3D&gaa_ts=690395d8&gaa_sig=fiqesrX09eaZtp2BDBs4SSdXxcHsEiID9ALXBhFiWqU0mcaiWrqnUhtW79hpdGQHBWj7Dig0iAaxhavEncYsMQ%3D%3D) inside the [National Guard](https://www.nationalguard.mil/) so that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) can deploy troops to any city he wants at any time.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has also used the shutdown fight to [cancel infrastructure](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/14/us/trump-grants-democrat-districts-government-shutdown.html) projects in [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) congressional districts, in order to punish even more people who didn’t vote for him. [Last week](https://newrepublic.com/post/202231/donald-trump-disaster-aid-states-voted-for-him), he approved disaster aid for three states he won in the last election, while denying disaster aid to three states he lost.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is engaging in a whole-of-government retribution campaign, using every lever of the federal government to target anyone in this country who he thinks is insufficiently loyal to him.

That has been his goal ever since his first term in office, when he tried to do the same thing over and over, only to be stopped by some of the people around him. So [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) knew the only way he could carry out that campaign of retribution in his second term was by making sure that, this time, there was no one around to stand in his way.

As [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) told journalist [Jonathan Karl](https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/jonathan-karl-on-how-trump-s-hush-money-case-sets-stage-for-his-victory-250768453877) for his new book “Retribution,” the difference between his first and second terms is “I know everybody now, and when I first came I knew nobody. … We had a lot of great people. But I didn’t know people. Had to rely on recommendations. Now I know people, so it’s good.”

There are reasons that there is typically a lengthy [vetting process](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/matters-trump-team-arent-vetting-cabinet-picks-rcna181665) for every person nominated to be in a [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s [Cabinet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/). The first is, of course, to make sure there are no surprises during the confirmation process, but the more important process is determining whether they are up for doing the job.

But [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) ignored both of those criteria in favor of his own preferred test: Who was most likely to be loyal to him? Who would be so indebted to him for nominating them that they would carry out virtually any order he gave? That led to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) assembling the most incompetent [Cabinet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/) of sycophants in modern American history.

Karl’s book offers a new window into how this clown car of people ended up in [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Cabinet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/). Take, for instance, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s appointment of [Kristi Noem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlGVUpBBGng) to be the head of [homeland security](https://www.dhs.gov/).

As Karl writes:

> *[Noem](https://www.dhs.gov/person/kristi-noem) had not been on the transition team’s list of possible candidates and had not gone through vetting for the job. When a surprised [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) advisor asked the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)-elect why he had decided to nominate [Noem](https://www.dhs.gov/person/kristi-noem) to be secretary of [Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/), he had a simple answer. “I did it for [Corey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/corey-lewandowski-46016810/),” he said. “It’s the only thing [Corey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/corey-lewandowski-46016810/) asked me for.”*

The “[Corey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/corey-lewandowski-46016810/)” in that anecdote is almost certainly [Corey Lewandowski](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/corey-lewandowski-bad-bunny-super-bowl-ice-rcna235176), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s loyal first campaign manager, who is now perhaps best known for his close relationship with [Noem](https://www.dhs.gov/person/kristi-noem).

The decision to nominate a completely unqualified loyalist like [Noem](https://www.dhs.gov/person/kristi-noem) was such a surprise that it even caught another former [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) campaign manager, [Steve Bannon](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-third-term-2028-pretty-clear-not-allowed-rcna240530), off guard. According to Karl, two days after [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) announced [Noem](https://www.dhs.gov/person/kristi-noem) as his pick, an exasperated [Bannon](https://warroom.org/) told him, “She runs the whole thing? She runs the fucking [Secret Service](https://www.secretservice.gov/)? It’s all of it. It’s the global war on terror. It’s all that. What are you talking about? She’s never been in law enforcement!”

According to Karl, [Noem](https://www.dhs.gov/person/kristi-noem) was not the only appointment that caught people in [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s orbit by surprise.

> *A [cabinet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/) finalist had been sitting in the [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) living room downstairs near a [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) weekend anchor, whom he assumed was in town to conduct a television interview with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). Like the rest of the world, he was stunned to hear later that night that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)-elect would be nominating that [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) weekend anchor — [Pete Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) — to serve as secretary of defense.*

It’s the same story with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s transportation secretary, [Sean Duffy](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-taps-sean-duffy-nasa-space-agencys-future-increasingly-doubt-rcna217951). Again, from Karl:

> *[Duffy](https://www.transportation.gov/meet-secretary/us-transportation-secretary-sean-duffy) had a colorful biography — in addition to his … experience [as a [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) host], he had been a reality TV star on [MTV](https://www.mtv.com/)’s Real World, served four terms in the [House of Representatives](https://www.house.gov/), won three lumberjack world championships, and worked as a local prosecutor in [Wisconsin](https://www.wisconsin.gov/Pages/Home.aspx) and a lobbyist in [Washington](https://dc.gov/) — but he had no relevant experience for the job.*

> *When [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) asked a friend of [Duffy](https://www.transportation.gov/meet-secretary/us-transportation-secretary-sean-duffy)’s if he knew anything about transportation, the friend answered, “Of course he does, he has nine kids!” Moving a family that large around, the friend joked, requires at least some transportation expertise.*

In other words, everyone knew at the time that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Cabinet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/) picks were not qualified for the jobs they had been given, because they weren’t chosen for their qualifications — they were chosen because they would be loyal foot soldiers in the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s [retribution campaign](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-retribution-campaign-james-comey-letitia-james-john-bolton-rcna237365).

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) didn’t want [Cabinet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/) secretaries. He wanted people who would always defer to him. The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) knew he could rely on [Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) to defend sending troops into [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/)-led cities. He knew he could rely on [Noem](https://www.dhs.gov/person/kristi-noem) to defend deploying [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) to those same cities and withholding disaster aid from blue states. He knew he could rely on [Duffy](https://www.transportation.gov/meet-secretary/us-transportation-secretary-sean-duffy) to defend the cancellation of important infrastructure projects in [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) congressional districts.

He knew he could rely on all of them to go out and defend any myriad of the crazy decisions he planned to make, and now [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is using that unqualified [Cabinet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/) to carry out the campaign of vengeance that has motivated him since day one.
