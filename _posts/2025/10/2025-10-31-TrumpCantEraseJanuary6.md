*This week’s Deadline: Legal Newsletter connects the authoritarian dots of the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s legal actions ahead of the pivotal tariffs hearing.*

Oct. 31, 2025, 5:27 PM EDT
By [Jordan Rubin](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jordan-rubin-ncpn1301611)

Welcome back, Deadline: Legal Newsletter readers. When we left off [last week](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-chicago-national-guard-comey-deadline-newsletter-rcna239621), we were awaiting a [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) ruling on [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s bid to deploy the [National Guard](https://www.nationalguard.mil/) in [Chicago](https://www.chicago.gov/). We learned this week why that ruling hasn’t come yet and likely won’t come until late November. In the meantime, the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s authoritarian tactics came into focus on multiple legal fronts.

**In the [Guard](https://www.nationalguard.mil/) litigation**, the justices issued [an order](https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/102925zr_hgci.pdf) Wednesday that didn’t decide the case but instead asked for more briefing. The upshot is that a lower court order [blocking deployment](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/scotus-set-rule-national-guard-deployment-chicago-nationwide-implicati-rcna239100) in [Illinois](https://www.illinois.gov/) is still intact, and the fact that the high court didn’t immediately lift it could be a good sign for [Illinois](https://www.illinois.gov/). But we’ll have to see what the justices do after the new briefing is completed Nov. 17. The [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) [argues that](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/25/25A443/379964/20251017155210488_Trump%20v.%20Illinois%20No.%2025A__%20-%20Stay%20Application%20-%20Final.pdf) the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has unreviewable discretion to deploy troops.

**Turning away from [SCOTUS](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) for now**, lower court developments underscored the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s autocratic approach. One example came in the case of Taylor Taranto, whose Jan. 6 charges were dismissed by [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Day 1 clemency order](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-january-6-pardon-taylor-taranto-rcna206518), but he still faced sentencing for other charges stemming from his actions [two years later](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-jan-6-taylor-taranto-obama-address-rcna191886). Two [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) prosecutors were suspended after they filed a [sentencing memo](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.257469/gov.uscourts.dcd.257469.155.0_5.pdf) stating the plain facts that “a mob of rioters attacked the U.S. Capitol” on [Jan. 6, 2021]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}), and that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) factored into the lead-up to Taranto’s 2023 crimes.

**[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is relevant to the 2023 case** because in June of that year, he shared online a purported street address for former [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Barack Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/)’s home in [Washington](https://dc.gov/), after which Taranto reposted the address and was arrested nearby. He was [convicted](https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/washington-state-man-who-livestreamed-threats-convicted-weapons-and-other-charges) of firearms and ammunition charges, as well as spreading a false bomb threat hoax. On top of putting the two prosecutors on leave, the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) [withdrew the memo](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/jan-6-doj-withdraws-filing-taylor-taranto-mob-rioters-rcna240570) from the court docket and said it was “entered in error.” Then two new prosecutors came in and [filed a new memo](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-jan-6-taylor-taranto-sentencing-memo-rcna240721) without the [Jan. 6]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}) or [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) references.

**Of course, the attempt to erase history backfires**, because it necessarily leads us to reassert that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) lost the 2020 election to [Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) and then [sicced a mob](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-free-jan-6-hostages-violence-rcna146020) on the Capitol, where [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) was certifying the results of the election he lost. Apparently, the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/)’s policy is to avoid mentioning that day entirely, and to otherwise airbrush any embarrassing facts about the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) from its legal filings. The judge presiding over Taranto’s case, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) appointee [Carl Nichols](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/district-judge-carl-j-nichols), [told the government](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67607958/united-states-v-taranto/?page=2) to file a memo explaining why it thinks the initial one should be sealed. We’ll see what the new prosecutors say.

**Elsewhere on the autocratic front**, scholars of global authoritarianism [weighed in](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/james-comey-amicus-brief-hungary-turkey-venezeula-rcna240340) on [James Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey)’s indictment by [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-installed prosecutor [Lindsey Halligan](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/comey-james-lindsey-halligan-grand-jury-ask-jordan-rcna241100). They aren’t the usual suspects to appear on a criminal court docket. But they [wrote to](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.582135/gov.uscourts.vaed.582135.73.2.pdf) the judge overseeing the [former FBI director’s case](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/james-comey-pleads-not-guilty-trump-halligan-rcna236313) to warn that it “mirrors many of the features of politicized prosecutions” in the countries they study — namely [Hungary](https://kormany.hu/), [Turkey](https://www.turkiye.gov.tr/) and [Venezuela](https://presidencia.gob.ve/Site/Web/Principal/paginas/classIndex.php). Urging dismissal of the indictment, they argued that it’s essential to view the case “in the larger context of how politicized prosecutions are used in autocracies and backsliding democracies and the risks that even one such prosecution poses.”

**Meanwhile, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) still has his own criminal litigation**, which we were reminded of this week with his appeal in the [hush money case](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-sentence-new-york-hush-money-case-rcna187107). It’s the only one of his four prosecutions that went to trial before he won the 2024 election. (His [two federal cases vanished](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/jack-smith-drops-appeal-trump-classified-docs-case-rcna181687) because of the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/)’s policy against prosecuting sitting [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)s, and the [Georgia](https://www.georgia.gov/) state case [is in limbo](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/fani-willis-georgia-prosecution-trump-dismissal-rcna235988).) In their brief to [New York](https://www.ny.gov/)’s intermediate state court, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s lawyers [argued that](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-appeals-hush-money-conviction-citing-supreme-court-immunity-case-rcna240294) prosecutors wrongly convicted him using evidence of his official [presidential](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) acts, in violation of the [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/)’s [immunity ruling](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-supreme-court-presidential-immunity-ask-jordan-rcna201873). The justices could have the final word on whether their immunity decision upends the hush money verdict, but it could take a while for the case to get to them.

It’s just a few days until the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) tariffs case gets a high court [hearing Wednesday](https://www.scotusblog.com/2025/10/trumps-tariffs-face-supreme-court-scrutiny/), when the justices will yet again confront the scope of the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s power. He said he might [attend the hearing](https://reason.com/2025/10/28/trump-hopes-to-bully-scotus-into-upholding-his-tariffs/) at the court, which [remains closed to the public](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) because of the [government shutdown](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/democrats-government-shutdown-trump-authoritarianism-rcna236960).
