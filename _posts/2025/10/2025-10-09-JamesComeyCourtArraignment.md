## [What to watch as former FBI Director James Comey is arraigned on federal indictment](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/james-comey-plea-arraignment-federal-indictment-rcna236198)

*Inexperienced [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) lawyer [Lindsey Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/), who secured the indictment, brought on two attorneys who have prosecuted criminal cases.*

Oct. 8, 2025, 6:00 AM EDT
By [Jordan Rubin](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jordan-rubin-ncpn1301611)

[James Comey](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/james-comey-trump-immunity-ask-jordan-rcna235454) is set to plead not guilty Wednesday morning when he’s arraigned on a [two-count federal indictment](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/read-full-text-james-comey-indictment-pdf-rcna233818) in a Virginia courtroom outside Washington. Beyond that simple procedural step, open questions remain in the criminal case against the former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director that [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [demanded](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/28/us/politics/trump-comey-retribution-precedent.html) and has now received.

Heading into [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/)’s arraignment on charges of lying to and obstructing [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/), here are three big ones, whose answers could help us understand the shape this case will take and whether it will exist as a case for much longer.

**Will [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/) seek a speedy trial?**

He reacted to his indictment last month by [proclaiming his innocence and stating](https://www.msnbc.com/all-in/watch/james-comey-responds-after-trump-indictment-let-s-have-a-trial-248377925835): “Let’s have a trial.”

Criminal defendants [aren’t always eager](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-georgia-trial-delay-rcna179107) to rush to trial. But we could soon learn how serious [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/) and his lawyers are about getting his case to a jury. [Federal law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3161) gives the government 70 days to bring cases to trial, though [delays are common](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/cannon-ryan-routh-trial-date-trump-rcna173600).

This could be a case in which pushing to trial gives the defense an advantage. [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/)’s experienced lawyers are defending the case brought by [Lindsey Halligan](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-lindsey-halligan-james-comey-indictment-rcna234122), a former [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) personal lawyer who lacked prosecutorial experience and was nonetheless installed by the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) to lead the [Eastern District of Virginia’s U.S. Attorney’s Office](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/). There was an opening in the [Eastern District](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/)) after an experienced prosecutor who previously led the office [was forced out](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-justice-department-fires-wrong-prosecutor-wrong-reason-rcna235424) after he bucked [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-backed pressure to bring a case against [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/). In one of many shocking aspects of the case, [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) [presented it herself](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/trump-james-comey-indictment-us-attorney-lindsey-halligan-rcna233853) to the grand jury after experienced prosecutors in the office objected.

**Will [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/) seek to dismiss the case as vindictive?**

The former lawman seems to have a decent argument that his case, [which centers on](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/25/us/politics/james-comey-indicted.html) congressional testimony he gave in 2020, should be dismissed on the grounds of [vindictive prosecution](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/james-comey-charges-fbi-donald-trump-rcna233662).

To be sure, his lawyers can press that claim and others while still retaining his right to a trial. But we’ll see how the defense seeks to prioritize any such motions to dismiss if [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/) also wants a speedy trial.

**How’s the prosecution team shaping up?**

Which prosecutors show up for an arraignment isn’t usually the stuff of intrigue. But here we’ve had the solo handling of a high-profile matter by an inexperienced [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) lawyer, who was installed for the apparent purpose of securing an indictment against a [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) target, over the objection of experienced prosecutors.

On that note, Halligan’s name was alone on the government side of [the docket](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/71459121/united-states-v-comey/) until Tuesday, when two federal prosecutors from North Carolina, [Gabriel J. Diaz](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.582135/gov.uscourts.vaed.582135.18.0.pdf) and [Nathaniel T. Lemons](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.582135/gov.uscourts.vaed.582135.17.0.pdf), appeared alongside her.

[Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/) is represented by experienced attorneys Patrick Fitzgerald and Jessica Carmichael.

How the case unfolds will be partly up to the jurist assigned to the matter, U.S. District Judge [Michael Nachmanoff](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/10/07/nachmanoff-comey-judge-virginia/), a [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov=) appointee. [Trump wrote on social media](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115270236987768479) that [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/) “is a Dirty Cop, and always has been, but he was just assigned a Crooked Joe Biden appointed Judge, so he’s off to a very good start.”
