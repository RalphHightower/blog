## [Democrats have some questions about DHS buying private jets to be used by Kristi Noem](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/democrats-questions-dhs-buying-private-jets-used-kristi-noem-rcna238636)

*The [homeland security](https://www.dhs.gov/) [secretary](https://www.dhs.gov/person/kristi-noem) was already a controversial figure. Then her [agency](https://www.dhs.gov/) bought two private jets for her and other [DHS](https://www.dhs.gov/) officials.*

Oct. 20, 2025, 10:44 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

[Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/) [Secretary Kristi Noem](https://www.dhs.gov/person/kristi-noem) has generated a great many controversies during her first year in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Cabinet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/), but one of the most problematic has to do with government efficiency — or in the case of the [South Dakota](https://www.sd.gov/) [Republican](https://www.gop.com/), the lack thereof.

Several months ago, [Noem](https://www.dhs.gov/person/kristi-noem) issued a memo requiring all [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/) personnel [to get her personal approval](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/spotlight-kristi-noem-brings-administrations-brutal-inefficiencies-foc-rcna218243) on all spending in excess of $100,000. In theory, the secretary said she was positioning herself as a responsible steward of taxpayers’ money. In practice, [Noem](https://www.dhs.gov/person/kristi-noem) quickly made [DHS](https://www.dhs.gov/) agencies slower, less responsive and less efficient.

This has been especially problematic at the [Federal Emergency Management Agency](https://www.fema.gov/), where critically important [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/) resources have been slow to reach disaster-struck areas because of [Noem](https://www.dhs.gov/person/kristi-noem)-imposed bureaucracy. Even congressional [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s aligned with the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) are [sick of it](https://www.notus.org/congress/kristi-noem-frustration-republicans-dhs-fema).

There’s one area within [DHS](https://www.dhs.gov/), however, where money appears to be flowing quite freely. [The New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/18/us/politics/kristi-noem-dhs-gulfstream.html):

> *The [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/) has purchased two [Gulfstream private jets](https://www.gulfstream.com/en/) for [Kristi Noem](https://www.dhs.gov/person/kristi-noem), the secretary, and other top department officials at a cost of $172 million, according to documents reviewed by [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/). The [jets](https://www.gulfstream.com/en/), which a department official said were needed for safety, are the latest expenditures on behalf of [Ms. Noem](https://www.dhs.gov/person/kristi-noem) to draw scrutiny from [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) and other critics who have noted her lavish spending on living and other expenses during her time in public life.*

Though the [Times](https://www.nytimes.com/)’ reporting hasn’t been independently verified by MSNBC, a [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/) spokesperson acknowledged the purchase to the [Times](https://www.nytimes.com/).

The [Coast Guard](https://www.uscg.mil/) originally requested \$50 million to buy a jet to replace the plane [Noem](https://www.dhs.gov/person/kristi-noem) is already using. Now, however, [DHS](https://www.dhs.gov/) is spending \$172 million to purchase two jets.

Two key [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/), [Reps.](https://www.house.gov/) [Rosa DeLauro (D-CT3)](https://delauro.house.gov/), the ranking member on the [House Appropriations Committee](https://appropriations.house.gov/), and [Lauren Underwood (D-IL14)](https://underwood.house.gov/), the ranking member overseeing its [homeland security panel](http://appropriations.house.gov/subcommittees/homeland-security-0), apparently want to know where the money came from.

“In addition to raising serious questions about your ability to effectively lead an agency whose procurement strategies appear to vary on a whim, the procurement of new luxury jets for your use suggests that the [U.S. Coast Guard](https://www.uscg.mil/) has been directed to prioritize your own comfort above the [U.S. Coast Guard](https://www.uscg.mil/)’s operational needs, even during a government shutdown,” the lawmakers wrote. “We are deeply concerned about your judgment, leadership priorities, and responsibility as a steward of taxpayer dollars.”

Time will tell how and whether the secretary responds to the request for information from Capitol Hill, but as the burgeoning story unfolds, it’s the latest installment in a series of controversies surrounding [Noem](https://www.dhs.gov/person/kristi-noem).

[ProPublica reported](https://www.propublica.org/article/kristi-noem-fema-florida-naples-sinan-gursoy) last month, for example, that a community in [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/) awaiting [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/) assistance found itself stuck in “bureaucratic purgatory,” right up until one of [Noem](https://www.dhs.gov/person/kristi-noem)’s wealthy supporters reached out to her, at which point the process dramatically improved.

A month earlier, [The Washington Post reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/08/15/kristi-noem-is-living-free-charge-coast-guard-commandants-home/) that the secretary was living for free in a military home typically reserved for the [Coast Guard](https://www.uscg.mil/)’s top admiral. “[Other Cabinet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)/the-cabinet/) officials, including during both [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)s, have paid to use military housing that otherwise would be occupied by top generals and admirals,” the article added.

As for her tenure as governor, the [Times](https://www.nytimes.com/)’ report noted that [Noem](https://www.dhs.gov/person/kristi-noem) also used taxpayer [to remodel the governor’s mansion](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/11/29/south-dakota-gov-kristi-noem-spent-68-k-sauna-more-receipts-show-capitol-public-records/8666319002/?gnt-cfr=1&gca-cat=p) (she bought, among other things, a sauna) before having [South Dakota](https://www.sd.gov/) taxpayers [cover the costs](https://apnews.com/article/noem-travel-taxpayers-south-dakota-homeland-security-c2655e00a16d44bba46c60a14a638f5d) of her pre-election travel in 2024, including a six-day trip to [Paris](https://www.paris.fr/).
