*Organizers called an “emergency” edition of the annual ride to bring attention to the “ongoing and escalating harm” to immigrants and Indigenous people.*

As the threat of [National Guard](https://www.nationalguard.mil/) troops descending on the city looms, protesters [in Portland, Oregon](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/portland-ice-protests-trump-ai-video-rcna236980), are putting a new spin on their demonstrations against the [Trump administration](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/portland-trump-claims-are-odds-administrations-assessments-rcna236660).

Organizers called an “emergency” edition of the [World Naked Bike Ride](https://www.travelportland.com/events/naked-bike-ride/), an annual [Portland](https://www.portland.gov/) event that typically takes place in the summer. On Sunday, naked cyclists took to the streets of the quirky city in order to “bring attention to the Militarization of [Portland](https://www.portland.gov/) and the ongoing and escalating harm that is happening to our immigrant and indigenous communities,” [organizers wrote in an Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/DPeK_47EZvH/).

Recent protests in [Portland](https://www.portland.gov/) have caught attention for striking a lighter, more absurdist tone than other demonstrations against the [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/).

Recent protests in [Portland](https://www.portland.gov/) have caught attention for striking a lighter, more absurdist tone than [other demonstrations](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/chicago-ice-protest-democrat-kat-abughazaleh-thrown-tear-gas-rcna232512) against the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/). Poking fun at [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s false claim that [Portland](https://www.portland.gov/) has been ravaged by war, protesters have gathered at a [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement](https://www.ice.gov/) facility in recent weeks in [inflatable dinosaur, frog, unicorn and miscellaneous Pokémon costumes](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/dancing-frogs-unicorns-protest-portland-war-zone-rcna236887), dancing to upbeat music.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has federalized [National Guard](https://www.nationalguard.mil/) troops in several cities, such as [Los Angeles](https://lacity.gov/) and [Washington, D.C.](https://dc.gov/), in an effort to crack down on what he has characterized as out-of-control crime. In addition, he also has floated [invoking the rarely used Insurrection Act](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-floats-invoking-insurrection-act-rcna236030), an 1807 law that would allow him to use the military for domestic law enforcement purposes.

Earlier this month, a federal judge ordered a [temporary hold](https://www.doj.state.or.us/media-home/news-media-releases/judge-blocks-any-national-guard-from-being-deployed-to-oregon/) on the deployment of [National Guard](https://www.nationalguard.mil/) troops to [Oregon](https://www.oregon.gov/).

“The court recognized what we’ve said all along: there is no rebellion, no invasion, and no justification for militarizing our communities,” [Oregon](https://www.oregon.gov/) [Attorney General](https://www.doj.state.or.us/) [Dan Rayfield](https://www.doj.state.or.us/oregon-department-of-justice/office-of-the-attorney-general/attorney-general-dan-rayfield/) [said in a statement](https://www.doj.state.or.us/media-home/news-media-releases/judge-blocks-any-national-guard-from-being-deployed-to-oregon/). “The [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) cannot keep playing whack-a-mole with different states’ [Guard](https://www.nationalguard.mil/) units to get around court orders and the rule of law.”
