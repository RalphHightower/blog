Oct. 21, 2025, 4:34 PM EDT
By [Jordan Rubin](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jordan-rubin-ncpn1301611)

A federal judge has rejected another early motion from the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) in [James Comey’s criminal case](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/comey-cites-samuel-alito-clarence-thomas-arguing-halligans-appointment-rcna238864). As was true of a ruling siding with the former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director [last week,](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/comey-indictment-trump-doj-discovery-ruling-rcna237506), this latest decision also questions the approach taken by the [Lindsey Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/)-led [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) team.

While [last week’s order](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.582135/gov.uscourts.vaed.582135.39.0.pdf) said [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/)’s discovery proposal would cause needless delay, [Monday’s order](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.582135/gov.uscourts.vaed.582135.61.0.pdf) from [U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff](https://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/Alexandria) rejected the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/)’s request for an expedited ruling on how potentially sensitive evidence is processed through what is known as a [filter protocol](https://repository.law.miami.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2009&context=fac_articles).

[Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) (who lacks prior prosecutorial experience) and her team (two [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) prosecutors from [North Carolina](https://www.nc.gov/)) made the motion to expedite the day before [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey)’s first two big motions were due Monday. In those motions, he is seeking to dismiss the case based on what he says is the [unlawfulness of Halligan’s appointment](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/comey-cites-samuel-alito-clarence-thomas-arguing-halligans-appointment-rcna238864) in [Virginia](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) and the [selective and vindictive nature](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/james-comey-vindictive-selective-prosecution-rcna238735) of his prosecution. The [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) will respond to those next month.

The prosecution’s [failed motion](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.582135/gov.uscourts.vaed.582135.54.0.pdf) sought a speedy ruling on the government’s proposed implementation of a filter protocol, which the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) said is needed quickly to “avoid potential delay.” It said the evidence for filter review “could also inform a potential conflict and disqualification issue for the current lead defense counsel, [Patrick Fitzgerald](https://www.chaliflaw.com/patrick-fitzgerald-lawyer/).”

> *Rejecting the expedition request on Monday, [Nachmanoff](https://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/Alexandria) suggested that any undue delay was the government’s fault.*

[Opposing the motion](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.582135/gov.uscourts.vaed.582135.55.0.pdf), [Fitzgerald](https://www.chaliflaw.com/patrick-fitzgerald-lawyer/) and the rest of [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey)’s defense team said the effort to “defame lead defense counsel provides no basis to grant the motion.” They said the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/)’s claim that the defendant used [Fitzgerald](https://www.chaliflaw.com/patrick-fitzgerald-lawyer/) “‘to improperly disclose classified information,’” and the implication that [Fitzgerald](https://www.chaliflaw.com/patrick-fitzgerald-lawyer/) and [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) engaged in criminal activity by doing so, “is provably false and in any event provides no basis to grant the motion to expedite.”

[Rejecting the expedition request](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.582135/gov.uscourts.vaed.582135.61.0.pdf) on Monday, [Nachmanoff](https://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/Alexandria) suggested that any undue delay was the government’s fault. The judge noted that the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) failed to ask for a speedy ruling when it filed its [initial filter motion](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.582135/gov.uscourts.vaed.582135.38.0.pdf) on Oct. 13.

In a footnote, the [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) appointee wrote that the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) “has had the materials at issue in its possession for several years and apparently failed to seek any guidance with respect to a filter protocol at any time before October 13, 2025.” He added that the report forming the basis for the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/)’s claim about [Fitzgerald](https://www.chaliflaw.com/patrick-fitzgerald-lawyer/) was public knowledge since its 2019 publication. “And yet, the government failed to raise any concern with lead counsel’s representation until the filing of the government’s motion to expedite on October 19, 2025,” he wrote.

While this is only a ruling on a preliminary issue in a case in which the litigation is just getting started, and there are much bigger rulings to come (including on [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey)’s [motions to dismiss](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/james-comey-indictment-trump-pretrial-motions-rcna236650)), the judge has not been persuaded so far by [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/)’s approach.
