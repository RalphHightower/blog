## [As Trump’s Argentina bailout gets worse, so do his excuses](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-argentina-bailout-beef-rcna238720)

*The government remains shut down, but the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is trying to aid one of his allies abroad with a taxpayer-funded bailout.*

Oct. 20, 2025, 5:42 PM EDT
By [Ja'han Jones](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jahan-jones-ncpn371241)

As millions of Americans [suffer from the impacts](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/19/trump-tariffs-us-consumers) of his destructive tariff war, and as others [suffer from furloughs](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/15/trump-government-shutdown-jobs-vought.html) amid the ongoing government shutdown, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) of the United States on Sunday issued a passionate defense of the people.

The people of [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/), that is.

The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) gave a snappy response to a reporter when he was asked how he justifies showering aid on the South American nation as American farmers suffer the consequences of his tariff war.

The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) recently announced [\$40 billion in aid](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/price-tag-trumps-argentina-bailout-set-double-creating-democratic-oppo-rcna237989) to [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/) that [Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent](https://x.com/SecScottBessent/status/1970821535507026177) has said are intended to prop up the faltering economy of [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/)’s [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-aligned [President Javier Milei](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/presidencia), who has relied on some of the [same principles](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/argentina-bailout-trump-milei-bessent-maga-rcna234502) [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s have implemented stateside. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s irked response came after he floated the possibility of purchasing beef from [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/), framing it as a plan to help American consumers dealing with higher grocery prices.

A reporter asked the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) about American farmers who’ve been [outraged](https://www.msnbc.com/katy-tur/watch/soybean-farmer-hits-back-at-trump-admin-s-argentina-bailout-i-want-trade-not-aid-249871941959) that his bailouts in [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/) could undercut them. “What do you have to say to U.S. farmers who feel that the deal is benefiting [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/) more than it is them...” the reporter started to ask before [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) interrupted. The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) — whose [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has [appeared to leap at](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5534675-mike-lee-russ-vought-layoffs/) the opportunity to [cut programs that Americans depend on](https://19thnews.org/2025/10/special-education-cuts-parents/) during a shutdown predicated on his party’s refusal to negotiate on health insurance subsidies — responded with some thinly veiled sexism and a claim that his plan is about improving the lives of poor and downtrodden Argentines:

> *‘Look, look, [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/) is fighting for its life, young lady. You don’t know anything about it. You know what that means? They’re fighting for their life. Nothing’s benefiting [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/). They’re fighting for their life. You understand what that means? They have no money, they have no anything, they’re fighting so hard to survive. If I can help them survive in a free world — I happen to like the [president](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/presidencia) of [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/), I think he’s trying to do the best he can. But don’t make it sound like they’re doing great. They are dying.’*

Let’s also note that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and [the [Republican Party](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/musk-doge-usaid-congress-republicans-rcna212382) slashed billions of dollars in foreign aid to countries around the world this year, an act that [human rights experts said](https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/07/01/nx-s1-5452513/trump-usaid-foreign-aid-deaths) could result in [millions of deaths](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/sickening-evil-musk-bashed-usaid-cuts-study-predicts-millions-die-rcna216832). So it’s fair to question whether [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s concern for the health and wellbeing of people abroad, or just his alliance with [Milei](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/presidencia), is his priority. Not to mention that numerous hedge fund executives and associates of [Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent), who’s has been overseeing the aid to [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/), [stand to benefit greatly](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/us/politics/argentina-bailout-investors.html) from [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s taxpayer-funded generosity.

Indeed, there seem to be a bunch of less-than-charitable reasons that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his team want to shovel billions of Americans’ tax dollars to his right-wing cronies. And none of them square with the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s promise to put “America First.”
