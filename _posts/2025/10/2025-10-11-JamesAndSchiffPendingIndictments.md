## [What Letitia James and Adam Schiff should take from James Comey's indictment](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/james-comey-plea-letitia-james-adam-schiff-rcna236392)

*[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s revenge campaign doesn't require convictions in court. Simple humiliation will suffice.*

By Hayes Brown, MSNBC Opinion Writer/Editor

UPDATE (Oct. 9, 2025, 4:45 p.m. ET): On Thursday, a [Virginia grand jury](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) handed up [federal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/grand-jury-indicts-new-york-attorney-general-letitia-james-rcna236735) for allegedly obtaining a fraudulent mortgage. The indictment comes after weeks of pressure from [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to prosecute his political opponents.

Former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) Director [James Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/) [pleaded not guilty](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/james-comey-pleads-not-guilty-trump-halligan-rcna236313) Wednesday to two federal crimes a federal grand jury in [Virginia](https://www.virginia.gov/) charged him with last month. [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/) now awaits a Jan. 5 trial in the [Eastern District of Virginia](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/), and neither charge the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) is bringing seems particularly robust — or even serious. Should [acting U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-lindsey-halligan-james-comey-indictment-rcna234122) even manage to secure a conviction, it’s entirely possible that he will serve little to no jail time.

[Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/) served as [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director when [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) first took office but was quickly fired for refusing to drop an investigation into potential ties between the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) campaign and [Russia](http://government.ru/). In the years since, he has remained a vocal critic of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s authoritarian streak and a constant target of the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s ire. [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/) is now accused of lying about authorizing a leak to the media during his tenure when questioned about it during a 2020 [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) hearing. The indictment [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) obtained charges him with making a false statement to [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) and obstruction of a congressional proceeding.

> *It’s the journey, not the destination, that matters most to the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) that has brought this case.*

But, to misuse an adage, it’s the journey, not the destination, that matters most to the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) that has brought this case. The road [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/) now walks is a fun house mirror of the one [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) trudged; indeed, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s being charged with crimes is what prompted this quest for vengeance from the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). And if the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has his way, [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) [Attorney General](https://ag.ny.gov/) [Letitia James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james/) and [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Adam Schiff (D-CA)](https://www.schiff.senate.gov/), may soon find themselves on that same road.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has never been subtle about his [dreams of revenge](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-2024-campaign-election-revenge-enemies-rcna123848) for the various investigations, impeachments and criminal and civil cases leveled against him over the years. [Schiff](https://www.schiff.senate.gov/), then in the [House](https://www.house.gov/), served as lead the impeachment manager against [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) in 2020. (He was acquitted in that impeachment and another the following year.) [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james/) successfully brought [a civil case against the Trump Organization](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/letitia-james-lawsuit-would-hurt-trump-not-bankrupt-him-n1299010) in 2022. (The massive fines were [thrown out by a [New York appeals court](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/21/us/politics/court-penalty-trump-family-financials.html) this year, but the fraud conviction she secured remains.)

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) falsely claims that these were illegitimate political attacks against him and casts himself as an innocent victim to others’ machinations, a folk hero who strikes back only when wounded. Soon after his [his first federal indictment in 2023](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-bedminster-speech-indictment-bidens-clintons-rcna89193), he declared that “the seal is broken,” meaning it was time to “get tough” against those “involved in the destruction of our elections, our borders and our country itself.” Since returning to the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has leaned on the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) to put his enemies through the same wringer he was put through.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s harrying has drawn results, albeit not as quickly as he’d like. [Schiff](https://www.schiff.senate.gov/) and [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james/) are [under federal investigation](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/15/us/politics/mortgages-politicians-paperwork-confusion.html) in [Maryland](https://www.maryland.gov/) and [New York](https://www.ny.gov/), respectively, over allegations of mortgage fraud, upon referrals from [William Pulte](https://www.fhfa.gov/about/leadership/william-j-pulte), director of the [Federal Housing Finance Agency](https://www.fhfa.gov/). [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has also gone after [Federal Reserve Board member Lisa Cook](https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/25/economy/lisa-cook-mortgage-bessent-chavez-deremer), whose illegal firing is [on hold](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/judge-temporarily-blocks-trumps-firing-lisa-cook-federal-reserve-rcna230241) as the courts weigh in, for supposedly obtaining a mortgage fraudulently. [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) separately [named Ed Martin as a “special attorney”](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/doj-opens-investigation-new-york-ags-office-brought-fraud-case-trump-rcna223731) in August to probe [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james/)’ and [Schiff](https://www.schiff.senate.gov/)’s mortgages, as well. In each case, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has repeatedly lambasted [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) for not moving faster and pre-emptively declared his perceived enemies guilty.

Neither the [Schiff](https://www.schiff.senate.gov/) investigation nor the [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james/) investigation appears to be making much headway from the outside. [MSNBC correspondents Carol Leonnig and Ken Dilanian](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/top-prosecutor-trump-pressure-charge-new-york-ag-rcna235922) reported Monday that a “top prosecutor in [Virginia](https://www.virginia.gov/) has informed colleagues she plans to decline to seek charges” against [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james/). [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) reported last month that [Martin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edmartinjr/) “appears to have scant evidence showing that the alleged wrongdoing [from Schiff](https://www.schiff.senate.gov/) and James] was anything more than paperwork errors.”

> *[Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/)’s rush to prosecute [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/) vividly demonstrates what a determined [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) loyalist can do if she places winning his approval over winning in court.*

[U.S. Attorney](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) Erik Siebert [under pressure from Trump](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/10/02/edva-firings-resignations-comey/) in late September after he declined to bring charges against [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/). His departure opened the door for [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/)’s abrupt appointment and her dash to [beat the statute of limitations](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/justice-department-weighing-whether-charge-james-comey-lying-congress-rcna233535). She pursued charges against [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/) despite a memo from career prosecutors “documenting why they believed probable cause did not exist” for an indictment. Despite the vagaries of [the indictment](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.582136/gov.uscourts.vaed.582136.1.0_12.pdf) the grand jury handed up, signing off on two of her [three initial charges](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.582136/gov.uscourts.vaed.582136.3.0_8.pdf), it still means [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/) is scheduled to face federal trial in just a few short months.

[Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/)’s rush to prosecute [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/) vividly demonstrates what a determined [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) loyalist can do if she places winning his approval over winning in court. But securing a final verdict against the former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director may not be the full goal. When [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was standing trial in [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) in 2024, one person close to him [told The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/04/27/trump-trial-election-2024-campaign/): “The phrase around here is ‘the process is the punishment.’”

In other words, in [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s eyes the very act of having to show up at court day in and day out, understimulated and overly constrained, was meant to cow and humiliate him. [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/)’s having to defend himself at all [seen as his punishment](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/james-comey-indictment-fbi-trump-halligan-rcna233910) for having defied [Trump’s early demands for loyalty](https://www.npr.org/2017/06/07/531927032/comey-trump-asked-for-loyalty-wanted-him-to-let-flynn-investigation-go) for loyalty. The same will be the case should [Martin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edmartinjr/) or [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) manage to secure indictments against [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james/) or [Schiff](https://www.schiff.senate.gov/).
