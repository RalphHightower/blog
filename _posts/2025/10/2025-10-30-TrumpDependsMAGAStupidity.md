## [What Texas’ Tylenol suit and the Trump White House’s website have in common](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-white-house-website-texas-tylenol-lawsuit-rcna240417)

*[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and [MAGA](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) are attempting to rewrite history and remake reality right before our eyes — and they’re weaponizing vulgarity to do both.*

Oct. 29, 2025, 7:24 PM EDT
By Anthony L. Fisher, Senior Editor, MSNBC Daily

[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-free-speech-immigration-us-citizens-rcna199629)’s [authoritarian rampage](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-military-kill-drug-traffickers-boat-strike-venezuela-us-rcna229937) has relied on a bold and cynical strategy to bend the [public’s perception](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/american-proud-patriotism-gallup-poll-trump-racism-rcna216616) of reality: abject stupidity.

Just look at the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s website right now. There’s a new “[Major Events Timeline](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/the-white-house/),” which begins as a seemingly standard sequence of events depicting the evolution of the [People’s House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), all the way back to [George Washington](https://history.house.gov/People/Detail/23425?ret=True) selecting the site, rebuilding after it was set aflame in the War of 1812, and all the way through [Richard Nixon](https://www.nixonlibrary.gov/)’s bowling alley renovation. When the timeline gets to 1998, though, it abruptly transforms into a crude [MAGA](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) troll job with a caption highlighting [Bill Clinton](https://clintonwhitehouse2.archives.gov/)’s [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) sex scandal.

> *[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s “big lie” is, at its core, a witless tantrum thrown by a malignant narcissist who lacks the integrity to accept defeat.*

That’s followed by a caption reading “[Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) hosts members of the Muslim Brotherhood, a group that promotes Islamist extremism and has ties to Hamas.” This is an apparent reference to a 2012 meeting between [mid-level National Security Council officials and political representatives of the Muslim Brotherhood](https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-defends-meetings-with-muslim-brotherhood-146361515/179333.html) in the aftermath of the overthrow of [Egypt](https://www.presidency.eg/)'s longtime dictator Hosni Mubarak. If the trolling weren’t obvious enough, the caption is accompanied by a photo of [Barack Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) wearing a turban during a visit to [Kenya](https://www.president.go.ke/) in 2006 — nowhere near the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and years before [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) was [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). 

From there, the timeline hails [Melania Trump’s tennis pavilion](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/melania-trump-unveils-new-white-house-tennis-pavilion/), mocks Hunter Biden’s cocaine use and rails against [Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) hosting a “Transgender Day of Visibility” celebration. Finally, the site gushes over [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) putting tacky gold stuff all over everything in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), paving over the [Rose Garden](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), and leveling the entire [East Wing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).

There is something telling about the official [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) website being casually debased by people working at the direction of the most powerful person on the planet — and for no other reason than to “own the libs.”

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and [MAGA](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) are attempting to rewrite history right before our eyes. They’re also trying to normalize untruths as facts — and they’re weaponizing vulgarity and stupidity to do both.

Take [Texas’ lawsuit](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/texas-sues-tylenol-makers-disproven-claims-autism-rcna240259) against the current and former makers of [Tylenol](https://www.tylenol.com/), filed by the [state](https://www.texas.gov/)’s [attorney general](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/) [Ken Paxton](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/about-office), alleging the companies knew that taking the drug during pregnancy can cause autism. This echoes a conspiracy theory frequently put forth by (who else?) [Health and Human Services](https://www.hhs.gov/) [Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (RFKJr)](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html), [despite studies](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2817406#google_vignette) and major [medical groups](https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/09/acog-affirms-safety-benefits-acetaminophen-pregnancy) asserting there’s no evidence such a link exists. But [RFK Jr.](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html)’s “Make America Healthy Again” movement isn’t based on facts or science — it’s strictly vibes, and the [MAHA](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) vibes essentially say all modern medicine is bad, including your vaccines, antidepressants and over-the-counter pain medicines.

Pretty much no one — and certainly not [craven Mitch McConnell](https://web.archive.org/web/20220212013421/https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-owes-it-all-to-mcconnells-disgraceful-dereliction-of-duty/) — thought [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) would be a viable political candidate [after he attempted a self-coup following his 2020 election defeat](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jan-6-committee-trump-capitol-attack-history-liz-cheney-rcna186138) defeat and his incitement of a deadly riot at the Capitol on [Jan. 6, 2021]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}). The conservative-leaning [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/), including the three justices [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) appointed, declined to even give his [his evidence-bereft claims of a stolen election](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/11/us/politics/supreme-court-election-texas.html) a hearing. [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) [an audio recording of him badgering Georgia’s Republican secretary of state](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-raffensperger-call-georgia-vote/2021/01/03/d45acb92-4dc4-11eb-bda4-615aaefd0555_story.html) to “find 11,780 votes” to overturn the state’s results.

And if [Fulton County](https://fultoncountyga.gov/), [Georgia](https://www.georgia.gov/), [district attorney Fani Willis](https://fultoncountyga.gov/Inside-Fulton-County/Fulton-County-Departments/District-Attorney/DA-Executive-Team/Fani-Willis) hadn’t bungled the case, there’s a chance the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) would be serving prison time in [Georgia](https://www.georia.gov/) today. Good luck for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), bad luck for justice and the future of American democracy. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) waited out the storm and retook the presidency.

> *[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s authoritarian rampage has relied on a bold and cynical strategy to bend the public’s perception of reality: abject stupidity.*

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s “big lie” is, at its core, a witless tantrum thrown by a malignant narcissist who lacks the integrity to accept defeat. It should have been consigned to the dustbin of history half a decade ago. Instead, it’s fully canonized in [MAGA](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) lore — with tens of millions of Americans believing a thoroughly disproven falsehood. And some of those Americans are now in positions at the federal and state level with [authority over elections](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/22/us/politics/trump-election-deniers-voting-security.html).

The [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) last week said it would [send monitors to New Jersey and California](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/us/politics/doj-election-monitors-california-new-jersey.html) ahead of next week’s elections at the request of the [Republican Parties](https://www.gop.com/) in both states. They’ll be looking for voter fraud that’s so exceedingly rare that when the [Heritage Foundation](https://www.heritage.org/) (of [Project 2025]({% link Project2025AuthorsOfDestruction.md %})[^201] infamy) attempted to create a comprehensive database of cases, it accidentally disproved its own theory of widespread malfeasance. “To come up with thousands of instances of voter fraud around the country, [Heritage](https://www.heritage.org/) staff had to go back decades in time where there have been hundreds of millions of votes cast and a very small number of cases of election fraud have been found, none of which affected election outcomes,” [Elaine Kamarck of the Brookings Institution wrote](https://www.brookings.edu/people/elaine-kamarck/).

And [as Trump muses about staying in office beyond the expiration of his term on January 20, 2029](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/will-trump-run-president-2028-rcna240146), there’s a tendency among many people who ought to know better to blow it off as [oh-so-much harmless Trump bluster](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-racist-biden-garbage-civility-cops-rcna178464). But [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s smart enough to know that overwhelming the public with seemingly asinine ideas and actions creates a disorienting, even blinding effect, blurring the lines between reality and fantasy and making it harder to challenge his lies. In essence, the stupidity is the point.
