I would keep the case of  Christopher P. Moynihan in [New York](https://www.ny.gov/); otherwise, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) would let him loose again.

Quite a few of them have ended up in legal trouble again.*

Oct. 21, 2025, 11:31 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

[Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [pardons](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/granting-pardons-and-commutation-of-sentences-for-certain-offenses-relating-to-the-events-at-or-near-the-united-states-capitol-on-january-6-2021/) for [Jan. 6 rioters]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}) were wildly unpopular and controversial for a great many reasons, including a straightforward, practical consideration: The [president](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) let a bunch of criminals, including felons convicted of violent crimes, back out onto American streets.

Those concerned about these individuals committing other crimes were right to worry. [The New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/us/politics/jan-6-rioter-hakeem-jeffries-threats.html):

> *An upstate [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) man pardoned[^20250120] by [President](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) after taking part in the attack on the Capitol on [Jan. 6, 2021]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}), was charged last week with a new crime: threatening to assassinate [Representative](https://www.house.gov/) [Hakeem Jeffries](https://jeffries.house.gov/), the [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [leader](http://democraticleader.house.gov/), at an event in [New York City](https://www.nyc.gov/). The man, Christopher P. Moynihan, 34, sent text messages to an unknown associate on Friday threatening [Mr. Jeffries](https://jeffries.house.gov/)s life, according to a criminal complaint issued by local prosecutors in [Dutchess County](https://dutchessny.gov/), [N.Y.](https://www.ny.gov/)*

According to the evidence presented by local prosecutors, the man texted, in reference to the [House](https://www.house.gov/) [minority leader](http://democraticleader.house.gov/), “I cannot allow this terrorist to live. Even if I am hated he must be eliminated. I will kill him for the future.”

The man who wrote the text was among the first group of rioters to break into the U.S. Capitol on [Jan. 6]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}) and was later sentenced to 21 months in prison. Moynihan did not, however, serve his full term behind bars — because he was among the rioters the [president](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) pardoned.

The [Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) reports that Moynihan has been charged with making a terroristic threat and is scheduled to make a court appearance on Thursday.

“I am grateful to state and federal law enforcement for their swift and decisive action to apprehend a dangerous individual who made a credible death threat against me with every intention to carry it out,” the [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) leader [said in a written statement](https://jeffries.house.gov/2025/10/21/leader-jeffries-statement-on-death-threat-and-rearrest-of-convicted-january-6th-offender/).

Noting [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s intervention in [Jan. 6 cases]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}), the [New York congressman](https://jeffries.house.gov/) added, “Since the blanket pardon[^20250120] that occurred earlier this year, many of the criminals released have committed additional crimes throughout the country. Unfortunately, our brave men and women in law enforcement are being forced to spend their time keeping our communities safe from these violent individuals who should never have been pardoned[^20250120].”

While it’s obviously important to note that there was an apparent threat against [Jeffries](https://jeffries.house.gov/)’ life, the minority leader’s observation about the larger pattern is worth keeping in mind.

Last month, for example, Robert Keith Packer, a pardoned[^20250120] [Jan. 6 criminal]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}) best known for wearing a “Camp Auschwitz” sweatshirt inside the Capitol, was [arrested in a dog-biting incident](https://www.pilotonline.com/2025/09/04/jan-6-convict-pardoned-by-trump-arrested-after-dogs-bite-4-in-newport-news/). That came on the heels of another pardoned[^20250120] Jan. 6 criminal[^20250120] [getting convicted](https://www.kcra.com/article/man-pardoned-by-trump-convicted-child-pornography/65432041) on child pornography charges.

Two weeks earlier, another pardoned[^20250120] Jan. 6 rioter[^20250120] was [convicted of plotting to kill FBI agents](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/jan-6-defendant-life-sentence-murder-plot-trump-pardon-claim-rcna216584).

They have plenty of company. [Zachary Jordan Alam](https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/national/capitol-riots/january-6-capitol-riot-zachary-alam-donald-trump-pardon/65-18b573a8-b4c3-4072-9493-67cb405fc2a1), months after receiving a Jan. 6[^20250120] pardon[^20250120], was [convicted last week](https://rvamag.com/music/trump-pardoned-j6er-convicted-of-burglary-in-henrico.html) in connection with a home invasion. [Andrew Taake](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/jan-6-rioter-andrew-taake-arrested-texas-trump-rcna191245), weeks after receiving a Jan. 6[^20250120] pardon[^20250120], [pleaded guilty](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/andrew-taake-pardoned-jan-6-210132201.html) to soliciting a minor. [Emily Hernandez](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/us/missouri-woman-drunk-driving-death-jan-6.html), weeks after receiving a Jan. 6[^20250120] pardon[^20250120], was sentenced to 10 years in prison for driving drunk and killing a passenger in another car.

The [Times](https://www.nytimes.com/)’ report noted a variety of other examples, including Brent Holdridge, a pardoned[^20250120] Jan. 6[^20250120] criminal who was [arrested again in May](https://kymkemp.com/2025/05/11/capitol-riot-defendant-arrested-again-this-time-for-copper-theft-in-humboldt-county/) in connection with a string of alleged thefts of industrial copper; and Matthew W. Huttle, who was [fatally shot by a sheriff’s deputy in January](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/us/politics/jan-6-rioter-shot-indiana-traffic-stop.html) after he resisted arrest during a traffic stop, shortly after receiving a presidential pardon.

Occasionally, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) boasts that under his leadership, “We are going to have law and order.” It might be a little easier to take such rhetoric seriously if the Republican hadn’t given so many “get out of jail free” cards to so many criminals who proceeded to break more laws.
