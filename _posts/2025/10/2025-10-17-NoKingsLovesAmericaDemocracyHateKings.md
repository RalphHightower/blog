## [As Republicans slander No Kings rallies, the party is proving progressive activists’ point](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-slander-no-kings-rallies-party-proving-progressive-activis-rcna238179)

*Centuries after “L’État, c’est moi,” [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s are putting their own twist on the adage: “I am the state” has effectively become “[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is the state.”*

Oct. 17, 2025, 10:49 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

It’s not exactly a secret that in American politics, partisan officials distribute talking points to their allies. The purpose is obvious: Those in a position of authority have specific messages and phrases they want the public to hear, and so they encourage disciplined communications, to be repeated as often as possible.

Ahead of Saturday’s [No Kings](https://www.nokings.org/) rallies, [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) officials haven’t exactly been subtle in what they want to convey. [The Washington Post reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/17/no-kings-republicans-hate-america/):

> *Ahead of thousands of anti-authoritarian ‘[No Kings](https://www.nokings.org/)’ protests planned for Saturday across the United States, [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s are trying to brand the demonstrations as ‘hate America’ rallies, ramping up their rhetoric about the millions of people expected to peacefully protest [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s policies as they did in June.*

After [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Speaker](https"//speaker.house.gov/) [Mike Johnson (T-LA4)](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) [used the line a week ago](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/ahead-no-kings-events-republicans-anti-protest-rhetoric-takes-ugly-tur-rcna237271), claiming the [No Kings](https://www.nokings.org/) protest scheduled in [Washington, D.C.](https://dc.gov/), deserved to be seen as a “hate America rally,” I started taking notes on how many GOP officials [embraced](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3m3ficdt2322s) that phrasing.

Soon after, I had to give up. [So](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3m3fhcvlyvw2q) many [Republicans](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3m3ahzjim3p2s) were [pushing](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3m3d25qvpxy2n) the [same](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3m3d3tuuude2e) line [that](https://bsky.app/profile/thebulwark.com/post/3m35yvxhsgd2s) it [proved](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3m35qull2m22a) overwhelming[^11].

[^11]: @RalphHightower: The [Trumpians](https://www.gop.com/) sound like that [Sinclair Broadcasting](https://sbgi.net/) op-ed.

The more [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) rhetoric about the [No Kings](https://www.nokings.org/) events turns hysterical, the easier it is to believe that the party is panicking about the growing public backlash to its agenda. Just as notably, let’s not forget that a benchmark of any authoritarian movement is the delegitimization of political opposition and a crackdown on public dissent.

But looking specifically at the party’s choice of slander, it’s also worth emphasizing the degree to which [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s are helping prove the progressive activists’ point.

There were plenty of ways for GOP officials to attack these protests. For that matter, [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s could’ve simply ignored them or downplayed their importance.

Instead, the party settled on an unusual smear: To oppose [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), they appear to argue, is to “hate America.” It’s a perspective rooted in the idea that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is the embodiment of the United States, and as such, his critics are necessarily unpatriotic.

[No Kings](https://www.nokings.org/) protesters couldn’t possibly love their country or its highest ideals, the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) argument goes, because if they did, these progressive activists would join the cult of personality the GOP has built up around their party’s [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).

“L’État, c’est moi” is a phrase attributed to 17th century French King Louis XIV. Now, 370 years later, [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) are putting their own twist on the adage: “I am the state” has effectively become “[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is the state.”

The party has been headed down this path for much of the year. Indeed, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), not long after his second inaugural [described himself as a “king,”](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-describes-king-heels-napoleonic-statement-rcna192969) which came just days after he [similarly declared](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/napoleonic-statement-trump-targets-rule-law-radical-new-way-rcna192438), “He who saves his Country does not violate any Law,” a phrase often attributed to Napoleon Bonaparte.

It was around this time when an official [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) social media account released a portrait showing a grinning [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wearing a crown.

Eight months later, his party has decided that anti-[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) protests deserve to be labeled “hate America” events.

If the goal was to discourage participation in the rallies, I have a hunch the GOP slurs will have the opposite effect.
