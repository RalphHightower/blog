*It’s been 20 days since [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) publicly called for his political enemies to be indicted and, so far, he’s gotten his way in two of the three cases.*

Oct. 10, 2025, 3:13 PM EDT
By Chris Hayes

This is an adapted excerpt from the [Oct. 9](https://www.msnbc.com/all) episode of “All In with Chris Hayes.”

On Thursday, [New York Attorney General Letitia James](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/one-thing-letitia-james-james-comey-indictments-common-rcna236837) was indicted by [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) on one count of bank fraud and one count of false statements to a financial institution.

This is one of those situations where basically everyone in the political world saw it coming. That’s because 20 days ago, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) explicitly directed his [attorney general](https://www.justice.gov/), [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/), to indict his political opponents on obviously trumped-up charges, posting this message on [Truth Social](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115239044548033727):

> *[Pam](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/): I have reviewed over 30 statements and posts saying that, essentially, “same old story as last time, all talk, no action. Nothing is being done. What about Comey, Adam “Shifty” Schiff, Leticia??? They’re all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done.” … We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility. They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!! [President DJT](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/,)*

At the time, given how brazen that was, there was speculation that it was supposed to be a private directive to his [attorney general](https://www.justice.gov/) and, according to [The Wall Street Journal,](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-doj-inside-political-enemies-17f13f72?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAhImKKSgBJy6lQEFox5a9UFKXvPrlTVFnMemSXCsbZTohS8hNvKIzZH&gaa_ts=68e8795f&gaa_sig=llCk13Res-ncyopwmjeUWKTPPV1o-qkEGdeUnU4r6RjNTIt3KvwWibiK3FU4SvjJai0NiBMRWovwSk_XdCKkVA%3D%3D) that speculation was correct.

“[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) meant to send a private message to [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) urging her to prosecute former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Director James Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/) and his other favored targets, according to U.S. officials familiar with the matter,” the [Journal](https://www.wsj.com/) reported. “[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) believed he had sent [Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) the message directly, addressing it to ‘[Pam](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/),’ and was surprised to learn it was public, the officials said.”

Public or private, that message was received. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s U.S. attorney in the [Eastern District of Virginia](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/), [Erik Siebert](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-forces-uncooperative-us-attorney-virginia-touching-new-scandal-rcna232515), was pushed out, reportedly because he did not believe there was sufficient evidence to charge James or former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Director James Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/).

Siebert was then replaced with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s former personal attorney [Lindsey Halligan](https://www.msnbc.com/ana-cabrera-reports/watch/halligan-s-lack-of-experience-is-devastating-for-morale-at-doj-defense-attorney-249641029845), who had no previous experience as a prosecutor. It is not even clear if [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) was [legally appointed](https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/politics/trump-halligan-doj-appointment-challenged-comey) to the job in the first place. But she got to work anyway and immediately indicted [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/), who was [arraigned on Wednesday,](https://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/watch/lawrence-the-only-humiliation-in-court-during-comey-s-arraignment-was-on-the-trump-side-249434181776) following up with [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james/)’ indictment on Thursday.

A sitting president doing this out in the open would have, I believe, ended the career of any commander in chief not named [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). He has directly ordered the pretextual prosecutions of people he does not like in a ham-fisted, retaliatory, lawless fashion that violates the laws of the country, the letter of the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/) and the spirit of liberty.

Putting your political opponents in jail because they are your opponents, not because of what they did, is the heart of tyranny. It’s an obviously [impeachable offense.](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-directive-ag-bondi-seen-impeachment-level-scandal-rcna232888)

If there is any silver lining here, it is that the targets of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s ire are not going quietly. Much like [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/) before her, [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james/) [released a video statement](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/watch/-i-am-not-fearful-i-am-fearless-ny-ag-letitia-james-responds-after-being-indicted-by-trump-s-doj-249589829666) stating in no uncertain terms that these baseless charges are an [act of retaliation](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/donald-trump-letitia-james-subpoenas-rcna224310) for her office suing the [Trump Organization](https://www.trump.com/).

“This is nothing more than a continuation of the president’s desperate weaponization of our justice system,” [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james/) said. “He is forcing federal law enforcement agencies to do his bidding, all because I did my job as the [New York state](https://www.ny.gov/) [attorney general](https://www.justice.gov/). These charges are baseless, and the president’s own public statements make clear that his only goal is political retribution at any cost.”

“I am a proud woman of faith, and I know that faith and fear cannot share the same space,” [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james/) continued. “And so today I am not fearful, I am fearless, and as my faith teaches me, no weapon formed against me shall prosper. We will fight these baseless charges aggressively, and my office will continue to fiercely protect [New Yorkers](https://www.ny.gov/) and their rights. And I will continue to do my job.”

But it’s been less than three weeks since [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) made that post calling for [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/), [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james/) and [Sen. Adam Schiff](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/james-comey-plea-letitia-james-adam-schiff-rcna236392) of [California](https://www.ca.gov/) to be indicted. So far, he’s already gotten his way in two out of the three cases.
