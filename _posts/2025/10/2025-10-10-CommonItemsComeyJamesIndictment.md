## [The one thing the Letitia James and James Comey indictments have in common](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/one-thing-letitia-james-james-comey-indictments-common-rcna236837)

*Both cases are brazenly and transparently corrupt, for the sake of brazen and transparent corruption.*

Oct. 10, 2025, 9:00 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

One of the most memorable exchanges from [“The Simpsons Movie,”](https://www.fox.com/detail/series/SER000852IRHK/the-simpsons) which came out in 2007, involved a scene in which Bart suffers a humiliation and has to wait for his dad to pick him up and take him home.

“This is the worst day of my life,” Bart says, at which point Homer [quickly offers his son a painful reminder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfpPArfDTGw). “It’s the worst day of your life so far,” he says.

The rejoinder came to mind anew this week watching developments unfold inside [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/).

Two weeks ago, when an unqualified [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) loyalist [secured an indictment against former [FBI Director James Comey](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-orchestrates-james-comey-indictment-fbi-justice-corruption-rcna233857), it was widely characterized as the most obvious example in history of a politically motivated [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) prosecution. Fourteen days later, we were reminded that it was really just the most obvious example of a politically motivated [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) prosecution so far. [MSNBC reported](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/grand-jury-indicts-new-york-attorney-general-letitia-james-rcna236735):

> *A Virginia grand jury on Thursday indicted [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) [Attorney General](https://ag.ny.gov/) [Letitia James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james/) on bank fraud charges following intense pressure from [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to bring the case. ... [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james/) was charged with bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution, according to the indictment.*

The parallels between the [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james/) and [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/) cases are striking.

In the latter, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) spent months targeting the former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director and pressuring his team to bring criminal charges against his perceived foe. When the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-nominated U.S. attorney for the [Eastern District of Virginia](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) [balked](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/forcing-disobedient-prosecutor-trumps-new-nominee-makes-matters-worse-rcna232922), and career prosecutors explained [in detail and in writing](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/former-fbi-director-james-comey-facing-imminent-indictment-threat-rcna233539) that the evidence didn’t support charging [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/), the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) expressed indifference to the rule of law.

Indeed, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) published [a public appeal](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-directive-ag-bondi-seen-impeachment-level-scandal-rcna232888) to [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/), telling her that [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/) was “guilty as hell” of unidentified crimes and [directing her to go after him](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-directive-ag-bondi-seen-impeachment-level-scandal-rcna232888).

“I just want people to act,” [the president told reporters](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-press-gaggle-before-marine-one-departure-september-20-2025/) soon after, referring to federal law enforcement officials. “They have to act, and we want to act fast. ... We have to act fast.”

To pursue his overtly political goal, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [ousted a U.S. attorney who refused to obey](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-forces-uncooperative-us-attorney-virginia-touching-new-scandal-rcna232515) and replaced him [with the [White House’s Lindsey Halligan](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-house-lawyer-takes-key-prosecutors-office-scandalous-circumstanc-rcna233233) (an insurance lawyer with zero prosecutorial experience), who proceeded to do what the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) wanted her to do: She acted fast and charged someone who'd dared to cross [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).

With [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james/), the circumstances were effectively identical.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) spent months targeting the state attorney general and pressuring his team to bring criminal charges against his perceived foe. When the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-nominated U.S. attorney for the [Eastern District of Virginia](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) [balked](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/federal-probe-trump-foe-letitia-james-hits-standstill-law-enforcement-rcna232047), and career prosecutors explained [in detail and in writing](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/top-prosecutor-trump-pressure-charge-new-york-ag-rcna235922) that the evidence didn’t support charging [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james/), the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) again expressed indifference to the rule of law.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) published [a public appeal](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-directive-ag-bondi-seen-impeachment-level-scandal-rcna232888), telling her that [James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james/) was “guilty as hell” of unidentified crimes and [directing her to go after](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-directive-ag-bondi-seen-impeachment-level-scandal-rcna232888) the [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/).

Soon after, [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) again did what the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) wanted her to do: She acted fast and charged someone who’d dared to cross [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).

None of this is subtle. Both cases are brazenly and transparently corrupt, for the sake of brazen and transparent corruption.

The indictments are plainly what they appear to be. A failing, desperate and unpopular [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) wanted critics to be charged, without regard for merit; he [publicly demanded the indictments](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-directive-ag-bondi-seen-impeachment-level-scandal-rcna232888); and [he found officials](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-house-lawyer-takes-key-prosecutors-office-scandalous-circumstanc-rcna233233) who were willing to feed his appetite for revenge.

As we’ve [discussed](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-orchestrates-james-comey-indictment-fbi-justice-corruption-rcna233857), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his confederates aren’t hiding their weaponization of the criminal justice system, they’re flaunting it. They want everyone to notice. They need other [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) critics to be afraid, and other federal prosecutors to understand that they’ll soon be unemployed unless they play ball the way [Halligan](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/) did.

The corruption is the point.

There might be half-hearted denials, issued with winks and nods, but by design, everyone should already be painfully aware of what is plainly true: The authoritarian crisis has arrived. We now live in a country where the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s political opponents are prosecuted at his command.

[Alan Rozenshtein](https://law.umn.edu/profiles/alan-rozenshtein), a former department official who now teaches at the [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/home) [Law School](https://law.umn.edu/), [told The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/25/us/politics/trump-retribution-comey-indictment.html), “What we are seeing is the almost wholesale collapse of the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) as an organization based on the rule of law.”

Those comments came two weeks ago, in the immediate aftermath of the [Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey/) charges. Now, the question isn’t whether [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his team are gutting the rule of law, it’s who’ll be the next person on the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s enemies list to face a federal indictment.
