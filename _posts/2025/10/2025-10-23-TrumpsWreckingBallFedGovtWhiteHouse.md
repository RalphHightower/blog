title: "Trump The Destroyer Targets the White House"
---

[Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) does not own the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). He's a fucking tenant. 

My naming the second season of "The Apprentice: Wrecking Ball" was meant figuratively [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) reckless destruction if the federal government. I never imagined that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) would aim his wrecking ball at the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), the People’s House! [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s gilded ballroom will look like a massive wart on the [White House)m](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) grounds.

## [Literally and figuratively, Trump is trashing the entirety of the White House’s East Wing](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/literally-figuratively-trump-trashing-entirety-white-houses-east-wing-rcna239311)

*In July, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) said his ballroom project wouldn’t “interfere with” the current White House structure. So much for that idea.*

In recent years, [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his allies have taken a firm stand in support of Confederate monuments. Sure, they’ve said, these statues honor proponents of slavery who took up arms against their fellow Americans and tried to tear the United States apart, but to move or alter these monuments in any way is to launch an attack on our collective history.

When it comes to destroying a third of the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), however, the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has embraced a very different perspective. [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-administration-demolishing-entire-east-wing-white-house-add-new-rcna239018):

> *The entire [East Wing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) of the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) will be demolished ‘within days,’ according to two [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) officials. The demolition is a significant expansion of the ballroom construction project from what [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said this summer.*

This has turned into a political controversy with several moving parts, so let’s unpack the relevant details.

Moving the goalposts while moving the bulldozers: In July, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [assured the public](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-house-trumps-destructive-impulses-take-literal-turn-rcna238839) that his ballroom project wouldn’t “interfere with” the current [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) structure, adding, “It’ll be near it but not touching it — and pays total respect to the existing building, which I’m the biggest fan of.” Months later, he authorized the destruction of the [East Wing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) facade, then most of the wing and then, as things currently stand, the entirety of the wing.

Rising costs: On Tuesday, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [mocked former President Barack Obama](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/10/22/us/trump-news/7382f7ca-adcf-5aef-b15c-ab02c3302805?smid=url-share) over the budget for the [Democrat’s presidential library](https://www.obama.org/presidential-center/), claiming that the [former president](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) made a mistake by prioritizing “women and DEI to build it.” (In context, the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)’s reference to “DEI,” an acronym for “diversity, equity and inclusion,” was apparently meant to mean “nonwhite people.”) One day later, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said the price tag for his ballroom had [climbed to \$300 million](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/22/trump-white-house-ballroom/), up from his recent \$250 million estimate, which was itself an upward revision from an original \$200 million estimate.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) now claims the [East Wing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) wasn’t that great after all: At an [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) event, the incumbent [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) said the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s [East Wing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), before he started destroying it, “[was not much](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-says-demolished-white-house-east-wing-was-ugly-anyway.html),” adding that it included elements that were “not particularly nice.” He concluded, “It was never thought of as being much.” Put another way, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [boasted about his “love”](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-house-trumps-destructive-impulses-take-literal-turn-rcna238839) for the original structure in July, only to change his mind soon after. (For the record, the [East Wing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), up until a few days ago, [really was quite lovely](https://bsky.app/profile/kimoco.bsky.social/post/3m3soezmrrs2g).)

For that matter, given [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s obsession with [adding gold finishes](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-white-house-oval-office-gold-touches-6018016d) to just about everything in the [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), he’s hardly the ideal arbiter for taste and style anyway.

Transparency: At the same [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) event, the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [bragged about](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3m3ssaikbmk2e) how “transparent” he’s been with the whole project. In reality, however, the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has [tried to limit officials from taking photographs](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/treasury-tells-employees-not-to-share-photos-of-white-house-ballroom-construction-1d4f2c49?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqcmRh8R_cV6rDoE_5y_Anq2buNmQV6_8mtWLT7epxyxX8rTItUKnT5ALoC53x4%3D&gaa_ts=68f7905e&gaa_sig=edfj_pD0I6wFhgF088iqDUe2vfuQL7BPwxK9UNICerAH0l1gmgeZhPfWYNQzwPeA296uQ6oz-dmSAzZmXoPIBw%3D%3D) of the destruction, and as [The Washington Post reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/22/white-house-east-wing-ballroom-demolition/), “The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has released few details on the project’s funding — and has not sought permission from Congress.”

A growing body of critics: The National Trust for Historic Preservation, a nonprofit agency created by Congress to help preserve historic buildings, [warned [administration officials in a letter](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/savingplaces.org/stories/national-trust-letter-regarding-proposed-construction-of-white-house-ballroom__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!p4pKR1Hpo2E77M-zAvqdpnGbTYj0EojB9URlspF07YAQXtUTXwUUbqqwjqU8h_k5EdwKluSCCkuKCe9pjneqCYnSUUNKEZLJXr9yL_dCbuXT7-hR50RJ_w$) that the planned ballroom “will overwhelm the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) itself.” The Society of Architectural Historians [also isn’t pleased](https://sah.org/2025/10/16/statement-on-theproposed-ballroom-addition-at-the-white-house/).

Haunted by recent history: In June 2020, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [posted a message](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1275379758021390336) to social media that read in part, “I have authorized the Federal Government to arrest anyone who vandalizes or destroys any monument, statue or other such Federal property in the U.S. with up to 10 years in prison.” Whether the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) remembers this threat or not is unclear.

A broken perspective: As journalist and historian [Garrett Graff summarized](https://www.doomsdayscenario.co/p/the-only-check-and-balance-that-actually-matters) summarized, “If you step into the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) as [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) thinking it’s your own house — not the people’s house, not a national treasure you’re inheriting for four years, handed down across centuries and generations by the 44 men who have lived there before — it turns out that there’s not really anything that can stop you from tearing down the literal [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) if you really want to. What’s stopped the previous 44 is that none of them would have ever dreamed of such a thing in the first place.”

And that’s ultimately what makes this a national scandal. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is clearly driven by a core assumption, rooted in an authoritarian perspective, that he can destroy national treasures at his discretion — because he sees our treasures as his own.
