*Karoline Leavitt defended [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s son-in-law, who’s raked in millions from the Middle East, and claimed he’s “donating” his time to “secure world peace.”*

Oct. 2, 2025, 2:35 PM EDT
By [Allison Detzel](https://www.msnbc.com/author/allison-detzel-ncpn1310186)

[Jen Psaki](https://www.msnbc.com/jen-psaki) called out the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) for its bizarre defense of [Donald Trump’s](https://www.msnbc.com/donald-trump) son-in-law, [Jared Kushner,](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jared-kushner-private-equity-firm-affinity-senate-investigation-rcna172758), whose company has netted billions from countries in the Middle East while he has continued to advise the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) on [foreign policy](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jared-kushner-gaza-plan-israel-hamas-palestinian-rcna228907) in the region.

On Wednesday's [“The Briefing,”](https://www.msnbc.com/jen-psaki) [Psaki](https://www.msnbc.com/jen-psaki) debuted her latest edition of “Jen’s Version,” a segment of the show in which the former [Biden administration](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) press secretary offers her take on questions asked by reporters during that day’s [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) press briefing, providing real answers instead of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) spin.

During the briefing, one reporter asked [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) press secretary [Karoline Leavitt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5OZvsqFs74) about Kushner’s reported role in the Gaza peace plan and why the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) decided “that it is appropriate for Jared Kushner to be working on matters that involve [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/), the [UAE](https://u.ae/), [Saudi Arabia](https://my.gov.sa/) — three countries that combined have given him more than [\$2.5 billion](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/10/us/jared-kushner-saudi-investment-fund.html) for his investment firm?”

While [Psaki](https://www.msnbc.com/jen-psaki) said she doesn’t usually show Leavitt’s response during the segment, the former [Biden [administration](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) official said viewers needed to hear the press secretary’s attempted spin. “I think it’s frankly despicable that you’re trying to suggest that it’s inappropriate,” Leavitt said. “Jared is donating his energy and his time to our government, to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) of the United States to secure world peace.”

[Psaki](https://www.msnbc.com/jen-psaki) wasn’t buying Leavitt’s defense. “I don’t know how Karoline thinks donating your time works but, typically, donated time does not come with financial returns — like huge ones,” she said.

[“The Briefing”](https://www.msnbc.com/jen-psaki) host then laid out some of Kushner’s recent deals. “I mean, just this Monday, we learned that Jared Kushner’s private equity firm has teamed up with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund for the largest private equity buyout ever, buying the video game company [Electronic Arts](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/jared-kushner-electronic-arts-argentina-tiktok-epstein-rcna234754) for \$55 billion,” she said. “That, of course, comes on top of the [\$2 billion Saudi Arabia](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jared-kushners-money-saudi-arabia-comes-sharper-focus-rcna70367) has already invested in Kushner’s private equity fund and the [\$1.5 billion](https://www.newsweek.com/jared-kushner-says-15bn-qatar-uae-came-irrespective-trump-win-2004895) Kushner got from the UAE and Qatar late last year.”

“But how dare reporters suggest that it is inappropriate for Jared to be involved in [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) discussions impacting those countries?” [Psaki](https://www.msnbc.com/jen-psaki) asked sarcastically. “What an outrageous question — his company is only getting literally billions of dollars from them.”

[Psaki](https://www.msnbc.com/jen-psaki) then directed her ire toward the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s party, “Meanwhile, [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) are so unwilling to shell out for the [health care of millions of Americans,](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/government-shutdown-republicans-lying-democrats-health-care-rcna234985), they’re shutting the government down.”
