## [E.J. Antoni’s failed nomination makes the White House look even more incompetent](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/ej-antonis-failed-nomination-makes-white-house-look-even-incompetent-rcna234896)

*It’s not often that [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) muster the courage to tell [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his team, “Whoa, hold on, we can’t go that far.”*

Oct. 1, 2025, 9:45 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

As a rule, the process surrounding [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s nominees is relatively efficient. The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) taps a loyalist with dubious qualification; [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) do what the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) tells them to do; and the nominees are confirmed to powerful positions that most shouldn’t have.

But there are some exceptions to the rule. Indeed, the list of failed [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) nominees [quietly become rather long](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/demise-trumps-nasa-pick-different-personnel-failures-rcna210461). The list includes [Matt Gaetz](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/matt-gaetz-withdraws-trump-attorney-general-pick-rcna181207), [Dave Weldon](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/facing-bipartisan-opposition-white-house-abandons-outlandish-cdc-nomin-rcna196236), [Ed Martin](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-ed-martin-nomination-us-attorney-jan-6-rcna205197), [Dr. Janette Nesheiwat](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/white-house-surgeon-general-nominee-casey-means-janette-nesheiwat-rcna205476), [Chad Chronister](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-lost-choice-lead-dea-just-three-days-rcna182783), [Kathleen Sgamma](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/kathleen-sgamma-withdraws-jan-6-criticism-came-public--rcna200699), [Jared Isaacman](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/demise-trumps-nasa-pick-different-personnel-failures-rcna210461) and, as of this week, [E.J. Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd). [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/ej-antoni-nomination-withdraw-trump-bls-rcna234833):

> *The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) on Tuesday withdrew the nomination of [E.J. Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd), a conservative economist, to be the next commissioner of the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/). ... [Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd), a contributor to [Project 2025]({% link Project2025AuthorsOfDestruction.md %}), was backed by [Steve Bannon](https://warroom.org/) for the post.*

For those unfamiliar with [Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd) and his nomination, let’s take a minute to review [how we arrived at this point](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/ej-antoni-labor-statistics-trump-nominee-bls-rcna229399).

A couple of weeks after [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) responded to [his ugly record on jobs](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/us-job-growth-turns-ugly-summer-trumps-economic-agenda-falters-rcna229286) by [firing the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-responds-failure-create-jobs-firing-us-labor-statistics-chief-rcna222532) without cause, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [introduced his own nominee](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jan-6-revelations-trumps-labor-statistics-nominee-create-new-test-gop-rcna224959): [Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd), the chief economist at the [Heritage Foundation](https://www.heritage.org/). Almost immediately, he was exposed as an almost cartoonishly poor choice.

His [academic background](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/ej-antoni-who-bls-44f73217?mod=hp_lead_pos1), for example, left little doubt that he was spectacularly unqualified to lead the bureau. But there was no need to stop there: [Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd) also had a record of [misunderstanding the very government data](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/12/business/trump-bls-ej-antoni.html) he was supposed to oversee; he’d signaled an interest in [moving away from](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/cooking-books-hiding-books-team-trump-puts-access-jobs-data-doubt-rcna224693) releasing monthly job reports; he’d [derided Social Security](https://www.mediamatters.org/social-security/trumps-bls-commissioner-nominee-ej-antoni-calls-social-security-ponzi-scheme) as a “Ponzi scheme”; and he’d helped craft the right-wing [Project 2025 blueprint](https://bsky.app/profile/thebulwark.com/post/3lwen55jkbk25) blueprint.

There was a reason [Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd) had been mocked by his contemporaries as “a joke.”

Just when it seemed [Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd)’s record couldn’t get much worse, [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/) reported that the [BLS](https://www.bls.gov/) nominee was also among the crowd outside the Capitol on [Jan. 6, 2021]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}). Soon after, [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/) and [Wired](https://www.wired.com/) separately reported on [Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd)’s since-deleted [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) account, which featured sexually degrading attacks on [Kamala Harris](https://kamalaharris.com/), derogatory remarks about gay people, conspiracy theories and weird references to weapons used by Nazi Germany in World War II.

After [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [John McCain](https://bioguide.congress.gov/search/bio/M000303)’s death, [Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd) also reportedly wrote online, “I like a [senator](https://www.senate.gov/) who doesn’t die.”

This came to public light in early September. In mid-September, [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) press secretary [Karoline Leavitt insisted](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/pressed-weak-us-job-growth-white-house-line-comes-far-short-rcna230325) insisted that [Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd) could be counted on to generate “truthful and honest data.” In late September, the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) pulled the plug on this fiasco.

To be sure, part of what makes these developments notable is what unfolded on Capitol Hill. This is, after all, only the third time since [Election Day 2024](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/2024presgeresults.pdf) when just enough [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) mustered the courage to say, effectively, “Whoa, hold on, we can’t go that far,” following comparable reactions to Gaetz and Martin.

But as the dust settles on this debacle, it’s also worth pausing to appreciate that the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) obviously didn’t bother to do its due diligence on [Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd), reinforcing concerns about rampant incompetence in the [West Wing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).
