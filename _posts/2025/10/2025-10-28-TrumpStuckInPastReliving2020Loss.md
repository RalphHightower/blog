*Despite a full plate and overlapping challenges, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is focused less on governing and more on the results of an election from a half-decade ago.*

Oct. 28, 2025, 11:03 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

By any fair measure, there was a lot on [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s plate last week. The United States was three weeks into a government shutdown; the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) was ordering legally dubious military strikes against civilians in international waters; [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) team were dealing with multiple court fights; and the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) was preparing for a major overseas trip to Asia.

But on Wednesday night, none of these important issues was foremost on the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s mind. Rather, he published [this message](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115420559392004198) to his social media platform, alerting the public to an entirely different priority:

> *Ask former [President Barack Hussein Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) whether or not he really believes that in 2020 [Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) got 15 Million more Votes than he did in 2012 (65.9 vs. 81 Million). Additionally, ask him why it is that [Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) ‘beat’ [Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) in every single Swing State with the Black Vote in 2020, even though Black Voters hate him, but in no other State? THE 2020 ELECTION WAS AN ILLEGAL SCAM/HOAX THAT THE PEOPLE OF OUR GREAT COUNTRY WILL NEVER FORGET![^11]*

[^11]: Never forget! Never surrender! Activate the Omega-13! Commander Taggart. NSEA Protector. Galaxy Quest, 1999.

Yes, despite a full plate and overlapping challenges, the incumbent [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) was focused on the details surrounding his election defeat from five years earlier.

While this is ridiculous, it isn’t out of character. In fact, even after [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) left for Asia, he [continued to](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115441871289276790) publish [additional items](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115445084269284249) about his discredited 2020 conspiracy theories. When addressing U.S. troops stationed in [Japan](https://www.japan.go.jp/), the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [once again pushed](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3m4agkmzizx2s) pushed the election nonsense known as [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s “big lie.”

If we were to stop here, it would be a legitimate story about an incumbent [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s unhealthy obsession and desperate desire to prioritize an imaginary grievance over his weighty responsibilities. But complicating matters further is the unfortunate fact that the broader story isn’t just about misguided rhetoric:

- [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) added a “Stop the Steal” lawyer named Kurt Olsen to his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) and [tasked him with launching an investigation](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-house-hires-another-stop-steal-lawyer-failure-inevitable-rcna238712) with launching an investigation into his 2020 defeat.
- The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) hired another “Stop the Steal” lawyer named [Ed Martin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edmartinjr/) and [rewarded him with a leadership position](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/pam-bondi-finds-new-job-ed-martin-special-attorney-pursuing-trump-foes-rcna223934) in the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/).
- [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has [hired election deniers](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/us/politics/election-deniers-trump-administration.html) to help oversee federal elections.
- According to claims the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) made last week, both the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) and the [Office of the Director of National Intelligence](https://www.odni.gov/) are [currently investigating the results](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3m3qaazbmvz2a) of the 2020 election.

About a year ago, with time running out in the 2024 presidential election and early voting underway across much of the country, then-[Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [JD Vance (T-OH)](https://bioguide.congress.gov/search/bio/V000137) refused to answer questions about who was the rightful winner of the 2020 race. The [Ohio](https://www.ohio.gov/) [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [complained at the time](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-steps-vances-message-clings-rigged-election-lie-rcna174049) that political journalists were “obsessed” with the election from four years earlier.

A year later, someone is “obsessed” with the 2020 race, but it’s not political journalists.
