## [Trump’s weird claims about grocery prices are the most self-defeating of his lies](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-weird-claims-grocery-prices-are-self-defeating-lies-rcna239338)

*The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) can’t simply wave his hand and Jedi mind-trick consumers into believing the cost of groceries is falling, but he’s giving it a try.*

Oct. 23, 2025, 10:54 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

About a month after Election Day 2024, [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) offered a candid assessment of why he won a second term — and it had nothing to do with immigration, crime, transgender Americans or even the economy in general.

“I won on groceries,” [he said](https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-december-8-2024-n1311184) on [NBC](https://www.nbcnews.com/)’s [“Meet the Press,”](https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press) adding, “I won an election based on that.” Looking ahead, [the Republican went on to vow](https://bsky.app/profile/acyn.bsky.social/post/3lcssg4x3fj23) that he and his incoming team would bring food prices “way down.”

Almost a year later, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) keeps pretending he’s successfully delivered on that promise. [The New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/10/22/us/trump-news/d18eef81-a9d3-5b02-8648-e999eea3d428?smid=url-share) from a Wednesday afternoon event in the [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/):

> *[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), for the second day in a row, falsely said that grocery prices are ‘way down’ and that inflation was not affecting prices, except for beef. The last publicly available data showed inflation rising to nearly 3 percent in August. In addition to meat, prices also rose for fruits and vegetables, chicken, fish and eggs, new and used cars, and clothing.*

It’s not exactly a secret that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) routinely tries to deceive the public, but he’s been especially eager lately to lean into his lies about groceries, [repeating](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-ivf-fertility-cost-reductions-october-16-2025/#215) the [line](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-ivf-fertility-cost-reductions-october-16-2025/#213) several [times](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-press-gaggle-air-force-one-october-19-2025/#113) in [the](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-bilat-mark-rutte-nato-october-22-2025/) past week.

The obvious problem with the claim is that it’s [plainly](https://www.axios.com/2025/09/11/trump-tariffs-grocery-prices-rise-cpi) and [demonstrably](https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/23/politics/fact-check-un-speech-claims-trump) wrong. There are a variety of reasons grocery costs have climbed over the last year, outpacing inflation, but the bottom line remains the same: [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s repetition of the lie hasn’t made it true.

The less obvious problem, however, is that this is one of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s most self-defeating lies.

American consumers go to grocery stores all the time, and they know that prices haven’t gone “way down.” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) can’t simply wave his hand and Jedi mind-trick the public into being happy about rising costs.

[The Wall Street Journal reported](https://www.wsj.com/economy/consumers/grocery-price-inflation-customer-reactions-346487f7) last week, “Inflation in the grocery aisle is picking up, and stinging consumers. Consumers said they are cutting back on purchases, stockpiling certain foods or exploring more-affordable stores.”

The same article quoted a clerk manager at a store in [Chicago](https://www.chicago.gov/) who said of his customers, “They’ll come in and say, ‘What the fuck?’ It happens all the time.”

Common sense might suggest that any political leader would have the good sense either to avoid the subject or to express some degree of sympathy for angry consumers. But [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), reluctant to acknowledge his long list of failures, has instead decided to tell grocery-buying Americans not to believe their lying eyes (or wallets).

If that weren’t quite enough, let’s not forget that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Department of Labor](https://www.dol.gov/) quietly warned that grocery prices are [likely to get noticeably worse](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-administration-eyes-higher-food-prices-result-immigration-crackd-rcna237379) as the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s anti-immigration crackdown continues.

It seems likely the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) would respond to those price hikes by insisting that actually prices were falling, but there’s no reason to believe those lies would work.
