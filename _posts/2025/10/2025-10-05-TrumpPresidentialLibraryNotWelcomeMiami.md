It would be very [Trumpian](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to be given land worth \$67,000,000 for a presidential library and [Eric F. Trump / LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erictrump/) build a hotel on to of it.

## [Florida’s hasty deal to host Trump’s presidential library flagged in legal filing](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-presidential-library-miami-dade-college-land-rcna235521)

*A [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/) educator is seeking to [stop the state](https://www.myflorida.gov/) from gifting millions of dollars’ worth of land for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to build his [presidential library](http://www.trumplibrary.gov/home) in downtown Miami.*

Oct. 5, 2025, 6:00 AM EDT
By [Ja'han Jones](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jahan-jones-ncpn371241)

A Florida educator is seeking to thwart local officials’ hasty deal to hand over land in downtown [Miami](https://www.miami.gov/Home) for the construction of [Donald Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-picks-convenient-time-change-tune-project-2025-agenda-rcna235375)’s [presidential library](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/abc-news-settlement-trump-defamation-library-rcna184267).

[Florida International University](https://www.fiu.edu/) professor [Marvin Dunn](https://case.fiu.edu/about/directory/affiliated-profiles/dunn-marvin.html) filed a legal complaint with the [Miami-Dade State Attorney’s Office](https://miamisao.com/) in an attempt to stop [Miami Dade College](https://www.mdc.edu/)’s plan to cede millions of dollars’ worth of land to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s nonprofit so it can build his [presidential library](http://www.trumplibrary.gov/home) — and God knows what else.

“I want [Miami Dade College](https://www.mdc.edu/) trustees to rescind that offer,” [Dunn](https://case.fiu.edu/about/directory/affiliated-profiles/dunn-marvin.html) [told WPLG](https://www.local10.com/news/local/2025/10/01/miami-historian-files-legal-complaint-over-trump-library-vote-they-took-land-from-our-kids/), a [Miami](https://www.miami.gov/Home) television station. “They took land from our kids without the decency of asking us, the public, what we thought about that.”

The [vice chair](https://www.mdc.edu/about/leadership/trustees-roberto-alonso.aspx) of the [college](https://www.mdc.edu/)’s [board of trustees](https://www.mdc.edu/about/leadership/trustees.aspx), [Roberto Alonso](https://www.mdc.edu/about/leadership/trustees-roberto-alonso.aspx), told the station that the board had followed all “applicable” transparency guidelines. [Gov.](https://www.flgov.com/) [Ron DeSantis](https://www.flgov.com/eog/leadership/people/ron-desantis) and his [Republican administration](https://www.cabinet.myflorida.com/) approved the move Tuesday.

As the [Miami Herald](https://www.miamiherald.com/) reported, the board’s vote had been “shrouded in secrecy” and led to the handover of land in downtown [Miami](https://www.miami.gov/Home) “worth at least \$67 million to [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [nonprofit foundation](http://www.trumplibrary.gov/) to build a [presidential library](http://www.trumplibrary.gov/home) — and potentially a hotel — without prior public negotiations.”

[Per the Herald](http://miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article312300881.html):

> *The vote comes after the [Miami Dade College](https://www.mdc.edu/) [Board of Trustees](https://www.mdc.edu/about/leadership/trustees.aspx) agreed to transfer the land to the [state](https://www.myflorida.gov/) in a [special board meeting](https://www.mdc.edu/about/pdf/2025-trustee-agenda/20250923-agenda.pdf) last week with no debate, no public comment or discussion of the fact the land was intended for a presidential library. After the vote, the [college’s president](https://www.mdc.edu/president/madeline-pumariega/) and [vice chairman](https://www.mdc.edu/about/leadership/trustees-roberto-alonso.aspx) told the [Miami Herald](https://www.miamiherald.com/) that even they weren’t entirely sure what the state wanted to do with the property, located immediately south of the Freedom Tower.*

In March, [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/top-trump-adviser-gets-involved-fight-win-presidential-library-site-he-rcna195474) that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s son [Eric Trump](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erictrump/) and [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) adviser [Steve Witkoff](https://www.witkoff.com/) had gotten involved in the search for a library location, which I’d argue demonstrates the alarming mix of politics and personal enrichment at play here. Sources also told [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/) that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s team has said it would like a new hotel associated with the library, as well.

In addition to denouncing the land deal’s secrecy, some critics have also opposed the library’s proposed location right beside [Miami](https://www.miami.gov/Home)’s famous Freedom Tower, which has become a [symbol of hope and acceptance for immigrants](https://www.nbcmiami.com/video/multimedia/miamis-freedom-tower-marks-100-years-as-symbol-of-new-beginnings/3666829/) after serving as a processing center for Cuban refugees.

As Florida-based immigrant activist Tessa Petit [recently told The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/01/miami-deal-for-trump-library-angers-critics):

> *It’s ridiculous they’re putting a library of someone who represents everything that is contrary to freedom, someone who’s making it his mission to destroy immigrant families, next to the Freedom Tower.*

Indeed, it’s hard to imagine a more fitting epitome of America’s [authoritarian president](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his [MAGA](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) movement than this plan to erect a self-aggrandizing shrine to the real estate mogul’s political career — [which was launched using anti-immigrant bigotry](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/06/16/theyre-rapists-presidents-trump-campaign-launch-speech-two-years-later-annotated/) — on land that has been gifted to him by political allies and next to a building that has stood as a longtime symbol of support for immigration. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) may well be [the most unabashed anti-immigrant hatemonger to ever occupy the Oval Office](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/12/trump-racist-rhetoric-immigrants-00183537).

Meanwhile, [Eric Trump](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erictrump/) is already sharing grandiose plans for the state-gifted land. [In a statement Tuesday](https://amp.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article312320111.html), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s son said he envisioned a high-rise library that is “visible for miles into the Atlantic, a bold landmark on Miami’s skyline.”
