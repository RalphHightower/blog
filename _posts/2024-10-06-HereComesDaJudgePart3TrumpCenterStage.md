title: 'Here Comes Da Judge Part 3: Trump Is Center Stage'
---


I live in a county, [Lexington County](https://lex-co.sc.gov/), that is so red that the
Republican primary is the general election for county officials.

From April to mid-May 2021,  I was hospitalized at [Lexington Medical Center](https://www..lexmedlcom/).
Even then, four months after he was evicted from the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/),
Trump was still whining, *"I won! I won!"* Each morning during the daily cognitive
test, "What year is it?", "Do you know where you are?", etc., that I'd have a little fun
with the nurses.

I would also add one of the following statements:

1. "Biden is still president."
2. "Trump is no longer president.$

Consider this, if a Democrat had acted the same as Trump, the "Republicans" would be
jumping up and down, screaming for justice.

Opinion by Jackie Calmes. October 6, 2024.

- **Trump’s 2020 Election Actions:** The article details Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, including false claims of fraud and refusal to accept the outcome.
- **Parallels to 2024 Campaign:** Trump is repeating similar tactics in his 2024 campaign, alleging election fraud and undermining trust in the electoral process.
- **Legal and Political Implications:** The unsealed government case against Trump highlights the potential consequences if he is not held accountable and re-elected.
- **Call to Action:** Figures like Liz Cheney urge voters to prioritize patriotism over partisanship to prevent Trump’s return to power.

Trump has demonstrated time and time again, over and over, that Donald Trump has no respect for the rules of law, except when he is the beneficiary.

Yes, there are voters who will vote for Trump no matter what just because he is their party's nominee. Ignore those comments that she's a communist, or a socialists; that's just Trump who never graduated from elementary school of childish behavior using taunts, and name calling.

But I urge y'all to vote for Harris/Walz, I'll use a phrase that Trump uses, "Vote for Kamala, or you won't have a country anymore."

I've done my best to replicate the front page of the document filed in the UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA of the case, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA v. DONALD J TRUMP.

That document is 165 pages long. I am not going to screenscrape a document that large and separate the words with spaces. It is also quite damning. My copy  and paste brought in the text with as many as five to seven words strung together without separation[^11]. The court document is available from many different news media websites. Heck, it may even be available on Faux News.

[^11]: Sort of like *"Trump-Speak"* where Trump strings random thoughts into a *"tossed salad of words",* and hopes it makes sensel

One thing that attorney Jack Smith laid out in this document is that although Trump was indeed president at the time that these crimes were committed, in the reelection, he was also candidate Trump, an ordinary citizen that cannot claim presidential immunity, which the Supreme Court sent back to the district Court to determine immunity.

**GOVERNMENT'S MOTION FOR IMMUNITY DETERMINATIONS**<br />
<br />
The defendant asserts that he is immune from prosecution for his criminal scheme to <br />
overturn the 2020 presidential election because, he claims, it entailed official conduct. Not so.<br />
Although the defendant was the incumbent. President during the charged conspiracies, his scheme<br />
was fundamentally a private one. Working with a team of private co-conspirators, the defendant<br />
acted as a candidate when he pursued multiple criminal means to disrupt, through fraud and deceit,<br />
the government function by which votes are collected and counted a function in which the <br />
defendant, as President, had no official role. In *Trump v. UnitedStates,* 144 S. Ct. 2312 (2024), <br />
including the defendant's use of the Justice Department in furtherance of his scheme, as was<br />
alleged in the original indictment — and remanded to this Court to determine whether the remaining<br />
allegations against the defendant are immunized. The answer to that question is no. This motion<br />
provides a comprehensive account of the defendant's private criminal conduct; sets forth the legal<br />
framework created by Trump for resolving immunity claims; applies that framework to establish <br />
that none of the defendant's charged conduct is immunized because it either was unofficial or any<br />
presumptive immunity is rebutted; and requests the relief the Government seeks, which is, at <br />
bottom, this: that the Court determine that the defendant must stand trial for his private crimes as<br />
would any other citizen.

## [Judge Chutkan Hands Jack Smith a Win in Case Against Donald Trump](https://www.newsweek.com/judge-chutkan-hands-jack-smith-win-case-against-donald-trump-1958815)

Story by Kaitlin Lewis. September 24, 2024.

Trump's defense team argued in a motion on Monday that the "fundamentally unfair" request from Smith should be shot down.

But Chuktan wrote in her order a day later that the court would grant Smith's request "to file an oversized brief" and shot down the defense's arguments about the legality of the briefing, including claims that prosecutors were seeking "to proffer their untested and biased views to the Court and the public as if they are conclusive."

"Allowing a brief from the Government is not 'contrary to law procedure, and custom,' as Defendant claims...it is simply how litigation works," Chutkan's order read in part.
