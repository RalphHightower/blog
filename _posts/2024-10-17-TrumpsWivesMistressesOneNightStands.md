title: "Trump's Extramarital Affairs, Mistresses, and One Night Stands"

@RalphHightower: It is mind boggling how Trump has bamboozled the clergy into endorsing him; marital fidelity has never been one of his virtues; if he has any, please let me know by posting on [RalphHightower/blog · Discussions · GitHub](https://github.com/RalphHightower/blog/discussions).

I contend that Trump was having extramarital affairs with his second-to-be wife while married to his first, *"test driving"* his future wife. The same withhis secondwife and futurethird wife. Such an incident occurred in Aspen, Colorado when Ivana met Marla[^322]

## Trump's Wives

| Wife | Married | Divorced | Nationality | Settlement | Alimony | Fringe Benefits |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ivana Marie Zelníčková[^301] | 1977 | 1990[^313] | Czechoslovakia (until 1993)<br />Czech Republic (from 1993)<br />Austria (from 1973)<br />United States (from 1988) | \$14 million9[^302]<br />a 45-room mansion, Greenwich, Conn.<br />Trump Plaza apartment | \$650,000 annually | use of the 118-room Mar-a-Lago mansion in Florida for one month a year |
| Marla Maples[^311] | 1993 | 1999[^312]<sup>,</sup>[^322] | American | between 1 – 5 million | | Apartment in one of Trump's buildings |
| Melania (Melanija) Knavs[^321] | 2005 | *not yet* | Yugoslavia. 1970-1991<br />Slovenia. 1991–present<br />United States. 2006–present. |  |   |   |

In 2018, Knavs and her husband, Viktor, obtained green cards and then became naturalized U.S. citizens using the U.S.'s family-based immigration program, which Trump had denounced as "chain migration".[^323]<br />Correal, Annie; Cochrane, Emily (August 9, 2018).

[^301]: Wikipedia – [Ivana Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivana_Trump?wprov=sfla1)
[^302]: Her lawyers said that she was entitled to half his wealth, valued at \$5 billion. Trump was near bankruptcy, and the bank provided Trump \$375,000 monthly living allowance.[^311]
[^303]: Wikipedia – [Ivana Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivana_Trump?wprov=sfla1). Footnote 1.
[^311]: Wikipedia – [Marla Maples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marla_Maples?wprov=sfla1)
[^312]: Wikipedia – [Marla Maples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marla_Maples?wprov=sfla1). 1996, Trump fired his bodyguard Spencer Wagner after a police officer found Maples and the bodyguard together under a lifeguard stand on a deserted beach at 4:00 a.m. Both Maples and Trump denied that she was having an affair, despite reports in the National Enquirer and other tabloids; the bodyguard himself told conflicting stories about the incident. Maples and Trump separated in May 1997 and divorced on June 8, 1999
[^313]: 1989 when—on vacation in Aspen, Colorado—they were observed fighting after Ivana encountered Donald's mistress Marla Maples.
[^321]: Wikipedia – [Melania Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump?wprov=sfla1)
[^322]: Wikipedia – [Melania Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump?wprov=sfla1). Trump met Melanija in 1988, while still married to Maples. Interesting overlap.

## Trump's Mistresses (Extramarital Affairs, One Night Stands)

It is my opinion that Trump was *"test driving"* Marla Maples while still married to Ivana Trump. Likewise, he was *"test driving"* Melania Trump while still married to Marla Maples. Of course everyone knows about porn star Stormy Daniels and Donald Trump, and to a lesser extent, Playboy Playmate, and Playmate Of The Year, Karen McDougal while married to Melania Trump. Melania's warranty has expired and Donald is going too trade her in for a newer model.

Donald Trump has the same problem that Bill Clinton does.[^351]

[^351]: A problem with their zipper.
