## [Trump's Liz Cheney Remarks Probed by AG as Possible 'Death Threat'](https://www.newsweek.com/trumps-liz-cheney-remarks-probed-ag-possible-death-threat-1978919)
Story by Jon Jackson. November 2, 2024.

For a person that narrowly missed an assassin's bullet[^11], Trump, the *"Tough Guy"*, ramps up his dangerous and deadly rhetoric, advocating deadly violence against[^12]! his critics.

[^11]: @RalphHightower: Trump claims that the *"Hand of God"* deflected the bullet.

[^12]: @RalphHightower: First, he declares that Democrats are *"the enemy within"*. Now, he advocates the use of deadly force against his political critics.

Arizona Attorney General:

- "I have already asked my criminal division chief to start looking at that statement, analyzing it for whether it qualifies as a death threat under Arizona's laws. I'm not prepared now to say whether it was or it wasn't, but it is not helpful as we prepare for our election and as we try to make sure that we keep the peace at our polling places and in our state." – Kris Mayes, Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes
- "The Arizona Attorney General's Office is looking into whether Donald Trump's comments about Liz Cheney violated Arizona law. The office has no additional comments to make at this time." – Richey Taylor, AZ AG communications director.

Trump:

- "Let's put her with the rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her. OK, let's see how she feels about it. You know, when the guns are trained on her face. You know they're all war hawks when they're sitting in Washington in a nice building saying, oh gee, well, let's send 10,000 troops right into the mouth of the enemy." – at an event in Glendale, Arizona.
- "All I'm saying about Liz Cheney is that she is a War Hawk, and a dumb one at that, but she wouldn't have 'the guts' to fight herself. It's easy for her to talk, sitting far from where the death scenes take place, but put a gun in her hand, and let her go fight, and she'll say, 'No thanks!'" – on *"Truth Social"*

Cheney responded on X/Twitter on Friday morning:

- "This is how dictators destroy free nations. They threaten those who speak against them with death. We cannot entrust our country and our freedom to a petty, vindictive, cruel, unstable man who wants to be a tyrant. #Womenwillnotbesilenced #VoteKamala."

Cheney, and her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, have both endorsed Trump's Democratic opponent Vice President Kamala Harris in the November 5 election.

Karoline Leavitt, Trump campaign spokeswoman:

- "President Trump is 100 percent correct that warmongers like Liz Cheney are very quick to start wars and send other Americans to fight them, rather than go into combat themselves."
 – said in a Washington Post article published Friday,
