- **Trump's Comparison**: Former President Donald Trump compared the treatment of Jan. 6 defendants to the internment of Japanese Americans during WWII[^11], sparking controversy.
- **Capitol Riot**: Trump continues to downplay the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, calling it a "day of love"[^21] and criticizing the treatment of those jailed.
- **Supreme Court Ruling**: Trump referenced a Supreme Court ruling that he claims should have freed the rioters, but it does not affect most of the convicted individuals.
- **Public Reaction**: Critics, including Vice President Kamala Harris[^31], accuse Trump of gaslighting[^32] the public about the events of Jan. 6.

About 140 officers were injured that day, making it likely the largest assault of American law enforcement in a single day[^41]. Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt[^42] was shot and killed by police.

[^41]: @RalphHightower: And You call yourself, the *"law and order"* president? 140 police officers were assaulted and injured. 

[^42]: @RalphHightower: Ashley Babbit is no martyr, saint, or hero. She and that band of criminals were trying to break in. His duty was to protect the legislators and vice president to certify the election. 

“Japanese Americans are not and should not be compared to insurrectionists who committed major crimes and in which people were hurt and killed,” said Sharon Yamato, the daughter of former Japanese Americans who were incarcerated. “And I think that that is just so horrible to try to even make that comparison or allege that there’s any similarities between the two.”

Absolutely, totally, fucking bullshit! Prison is for those that commit criminal acts, such as combating police officers, with bear spray, and weapons. Hunting down Vice President Pence with chants of *"Hang Mike Pence"*, Democratic lawmakers, like Pelosi. Destruction of property. Breaking and entering a secured place.

Mike Pence was performing his ceremonial duty. He had no power to stop the certification. 

[^11]: @RalphHightower: [George Takei • Wikioedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Takei) as child was interned with his family in Japanese internment camps, initially housed in horse stables in California, latee at camps in Arkansas and California. He wrote [They Called Us Enemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/They_Called_Us_Enemy?wprov=sfla1) about his experience living in internment camps.

[^21]: @RalphHightower: **Bullshit!** The January 6, 2021 Insurrection was not *Woodstock – The Music Festival.* It was a God-damned riot promoted by the *"law and order"* president Trump that posted on X/Twitter, *"...Big protest at US Capitol. Be wild."[^22]*.

[^31]: @RalphHightower: Trump has been gaslighting[^31], way before his presidential run that he has religious leaders, such as, [Franklin Graham](https://billygraham.org/about/biographies/franklin-graham/) bamboozled[^33].

Jason<br />//As the midterm elections approach, Americans have gotten an earful both about crime itself and how the other side is distorting the news about it for political gain. “Cherry-picking!” “Fearmongering!” “Gaslighting!”<br />— Chris Herrmann and Fritz Umbach<br />//Intense gaslighting techniques are making it difficult for Montana's commoners to discern what's truth and what's propaganda.<br />
