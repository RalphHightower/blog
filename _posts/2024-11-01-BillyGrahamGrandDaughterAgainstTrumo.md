## [Trump Lacks 'Basic Principles Of Our Faith,' Says Famed Evangelist's Granddaughter](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/famed-evangelists-granddaughter-says-trump-lacks-basic-principles-of-our-faith_n_6723795ce4b02f5ab1d281eb)

Story by Marco Margaritoff. October 31, 2024.

- **Jerushah Duford's Stance**: Jerushah Duford, granddaughter of Rev. Billy Graham, will not vote for Donald Trump, citing his failure to represent Christian values like kindness and gentleness.
- **Criticism of Trump**: Duford criticized Trump for not embodying the basic tenets of faith and for offensive comments made at his rally.
- **Religious Community's Dilemma**: Duford mentioned that many in her religious community feel conflicted between their church leaders' endorsements and their own interpretations of scripture.
- **Pro-Life Perspective**: Duford's pro-life stance extends from "womb to grave," contrasting with what she perceives as Trump's dehumanizing rhetoric.

Duford told Forbes that she doesn’t know how anyone can reconcile the stark contrast of the lessons of Jesus with what the world has witnessed in the White House during the last four years. She said she wants to reach out to women who feel uncomfortable voting Democratic for the first time in their lives. Duford, a leading religious voice in the new coalition, is also the niece of conservative evangelical leader and Trump supporter Franklin Graham.

- “The future of our families, our communities and our country lie in our hands. We know that women will play a critical role in defeating Donald Trump in this election. They are women who are unwilling to yield to the demeaning assaults from the president, or pressure from the Republican Party,” – " said Jennifer Horn, cofounder of The Lincoln Project and former chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party.” 
- "We are fearful for the health and safety of our families, we are tired of constant lies and bullying from the Oval Office.” – Susan Del Percio, *"Republican"* strategist
