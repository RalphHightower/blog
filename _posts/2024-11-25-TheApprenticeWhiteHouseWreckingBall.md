excerpt: "DOGE’s agenda threatens to upend federal governance, from environmental protections to public health programs. Critics warn that the commission’s proposals prioritize corporate profits and austerity over the public good, risking long-term harm to the nation’s social fabric. Based on Elon Musk’s comments, the so-called Department of Government Efficiency is poised to make far-reaching recommendations that could have a devastating impact on Americans and enormously benefit insiders, starting with Musk himself."

## The Apprentice: White House – Wrecking Ball

@RalphHightower:

It didn't take me very long to think of a name for this season of The Apprentice: White House. Donald fancies himself as a builder, but his plans for America are more like "bulls in a china shop", so, "Extreme Makeover" is out of the question. Trump is more bent on destruction than anything else. 

Government services will be cut. Citizens will suffer.

As [Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk) is a fractional CEO[^11] of many companies that do are a customer of the federal government agencies, ([NASA](https://www.nasa.gov), [X](https://x.com/) by many federal agencies),and regulated by many federal agencies, [EPA](https:www.epa.gov), [SEC](https://www.sec.gov/), [FCC](https://www.fcc.gov/), [FAA](https://www.faa.gov/), and [NHTSA](www.nhtsa.gov/), [Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk) stand to benefit substantial financial gains. 

Even as an unpaid "volunteer to thefederalgovernment,  [Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk) and his companies could benefit financially from the federal government. 

[11]: fractional CEO: while there is a definition meaning a short term CEO as a temporary leader, my definition is since he has a leadership role in many companies, he doesn't have the time to provide leadership for all his companies: X, SpaceX. Starlink, SpaceX  Tesla, Neuralink, Hyperloop, Boring Company, xAI, Solar City, Tesla Energy.

Trump has not learned a damn thing from his first term as president. JD Vance has less than two years of experience in government. Musk and Ramaswamy have zero experience in government. That’s four imbeciles that will have major repercussions on America for a long time.

### [Musk and Ramaswamy’s Doge: Mass Firings, Deregulation, and the Erosion of Federal Protections](https://znetwork.org/znetarticle/musk-and-ramaswamys-doge-mass-firings-deregulation-and-the-erosion-of-federal-protections/?)

Story by Alexis Sterling. November 25, 2024.

Here are the key points from the article:

- **DOGE Overview**: The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by [Elon Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk) and [Vivek Ramaswamy](https://x.com/vivekgramaswamy), aims to overhaul federal operations through deregulation, mass firings, and spending cuts.
- **Criticism**: Critics argue that DOGE's plans will erode social safety nets, undermine public services, and disproportionately benefit corporate interests, including [Musk's](https://x.com/elonmusk) ventures.
- **Strategies**: DOGE's strategies include reducing the federal workforce, rescinding regulations, and cutting federal spending, targeting over $516 billion in "unauthorized" programs.
- **Potential Impact**: Watchdog groups warn that these measures could harm vulnerable populations and prioritize corporate profits over public welfare.

President-elect [Donald Trump'](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump) proposed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by [Elon Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk) and [Vivek Ramaswamy](https://x.com/vivekgramaswamy), has unveiled an ambitious blueprint to overhaul federal operations through sweeping deregulation, mass firings, and severe spending cuts. Critics argue that these plans will erode social safety nets, undermine public services, and disproportionately benefit corporate interests.

Despite its name, DOGE is not a formal federal department but an advisory commission. It lacks direct legal authority but wields considerable influence under the stewardship of two high-profile [Trump](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump) allies. [Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk), the billionaire CEO of Tesla, and [Ramaswamy](https://x.com/vivekgramaswamy), a biotech entrepreneur and former presidential candidate, aim to push through sweeping reforms aligned with small-government ideals.

[Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk) and [Ramaswamy's](https://x.com/vivekgramaswamy) stated goal is to cut government inefficiencies and reduce federal oversight. They have pledged to recruit “super high-IQ small-government revolutionaries” to lead the charge. However, watchdog groups warn that DOGE’s agenda serves as a vehicle to dismantle federal protections while advancing corporate interests, including [Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk)’s own business ventures.

[Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk) and [Ramaswamy](https://x.com/vivekgramaswamy) outlined their vision in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, highlighting three key strategies: mass reductions in federal workforce, regulatory rescissions, and cuts to federal spending.

DOGE’s first priority involves significant downsizing of the federal workforce, with staff reductions tied to the elimination of regulations. “Not only are fewer employees required to enforce fewer regulations, but the agency would produce fewer regulations once its scope of authority is properly limited,” the op-ed reads.

Supreme Court rulings like West Virginia v. EPA and Collins v. Yellen are cited as legal precedents to justify the layoffs. The commission also proposes reinstating in-person work requirements, predicting that such mandates would prompt voluntary resignations among federal employees. “If federal employees don’t want to show up, American taxpayers shouldn’t pay them for the Covid-era privilege of staying home,” [Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk) and [Ramaswamy](https://x.com/vivekgramaswamy) wrote.

Critics, however, warn that these cuts would cripple federal agencies’ ability to enforce laws and deliver essential services. Public Citizen co-president Robert Weissman described DOGE’s plan as “a multipronged attack on any institution that seeks to constrain big business.”

The commission aims to dismantle thousands of federal regulations, targeting what it describes as “rules crafted by unelected bureaucrats.” [Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk) and [Ramaswamy](https://x.com/vivekgramaswamy) argue that the president has the executive power to nullify these regulations unilaterally.

DOGE plans to embed legal experts within federal agencies to review existing regulations and recommend rescissions. Environmental protections, labor laws, and financial oversight are likely to be among the first targets. Critics argue that this deregulation benefits corporate entities, including [Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk)’s companies, which face scrutiny from multiple federal agencies for alleged violations of labor and safety laws.

DOGE also proposes significant cuts to federal spending, targeting over $516 billion in programs classified as “unauthorized.” These include veterans’ healthcare, education funding, housing assistance, and childcare programs. The commission specifically named Planned Parenthood and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting as examples of organizations that would lose funding.

In their op-ed, [Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk) and [Ramaswamy](https://x.com/vivekgramaswamy) suggested using executive authority to bypass congressional restrictions and redirect funds. They claimed these measures would address federal overspending, but critics argue that such cuts disproportionately harm vulnerable communities.

Watchdog groups have raised concerns about the potential conflicts of interest inherent in [Musk's](https://x.com/elonmusk) leadership. Tesla, SpaceX, and other [Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk) ventures could directly benefit from reduced federal oversight and compliance costs. “Based on [Elon Musk's](https://x.com/elonmusk) comments, the so-called Department of Government Efficiency is poised to make far-reaching recommendations that could have a devastating impact on Americans and enormously benefit insiders, starting with [Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk) himself,” Weissman said.

Beyond [Musk's](https://x.com/elonmusk) personal interests, DOGE’s proposals align with a broader GOP agenda to prioritize corporate profits over public welfare. The dismantling of regulatory safeguards risks creating an environment where big business operates with little accountability.

[Ramaswamy's](https://x.com/vivekgramaswamy) praise for Argentine President Javier Milei’s economic policies has drawn attention. Milei’s austerity measures have slashed social safety nets while cutting taxes for the wealthiest citizens, leading to a dramatic increase in poverty. [Ramaswamy's](https://x.com/vivekgramaswamy) tweet describing DOGE’s proposals as “Milei-style cuts, on steroids” underscores the potential for similar outcomes in the United States.

Casey Wetherbee, writing for Jacobin, warned that DOGE’s recommendations could cause “temporary hardship” for American workers while benefiting the nation’s wealthiest. “DOGE’s relationship with the [Trump](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump) administration could flame out spectacularly,” Wetherbee wrote, but not before significant damage is done.

Progressive lawmakers and advocacy groups have voiced strong opposition to DOGE’s plans. They argue that mass layoffs, deregulation, and spending cuts will harm vulnerable populations while enriching corporate elites. Democrats have also criticized [Trump](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump) for relying on two individuals to lead DOGE, despite their lack of government experience.

[Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk) and [Ramaswamy](https://x.com/vivekgramaswamy), for their part, dismiss these criticisms. “We are entrepreneurs, not politicians,” they wrote. “We will serve as outside volunteers, not federal officials or employees. Unlike government commissions or advisory committees, we won’t just write reports or cut ribbons. We’ll cut costs.”

DOGE’s agenda threatens to upend federal governance, from environmental protections to public health programs. Critics warn that the commission’s proposals prioritize corporate profits and austerity over the public good, risking long-term harm to the nation’s social fabric.

“A second [Trump](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump) term will undoubtedly see a multipronged attack on any institution that seeks to constrain big business, and DOGE will lead the charge,” said Robert Weissman.
