## [Prosecutors open investigation into Fed Chair Powell, sparking immediate backlash](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/prosecutors-open-investigation-into-fed-chair-powell-sparking-immediate-backlash)

*[Team Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has embraced the idea that the levers of prosecutorial power are just another tool to be used against those who get in the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s way.*

Jan. 12, 2026, 8:00 AM EST
By [Steve Benen](https://www.ms.now/author/steve-benen)

[Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) spent much of 2025 publicly and privately lobbying his handpicked [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) chair, [Jerome Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm), to lower interest rates. When the heavy-handed tactics didn’t have much of an effect, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) resorted to [juvenile taunts and name-calling](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/inflation-picked-june-trumps-trade-tariffs-pushed-prices-higher-rcna218891), publicly condemning [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) as (among many other things) a “moron” for failing to follow the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s misguided demands.

Two weeks ago, however, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s position took a curious turn: He [announced](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-eyes-outlandish-lawsuit-against-the-feds-powell-alleging-incompetence) on Dec. 30 that his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) would “probably bring a lawsuit against” [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm).

That didn’t make a lot of sense — there were no grounds for such a case — but two weeks later, those comments became relevant anew. As it happens, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) didn’t bother pursuing some baseless civil suit against the [Fed chair](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm); instead, his team settled on a different legal tactic. [The New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/11/us/politics/jerome-powell-fed-inquiry-trump.html):

> *The [U.S. attorney’s office](https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc) in the [District of Columbia](https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc),has opened a criminal investigation into [Jerome H. Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm), the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) chair, over the [central bank](https://www.federalreserve.gov/)’s renovation of its [Washington headquarters](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed.htm) and whether [Mr. Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) lied to [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) about the scope of the project, according to officials briefed on the situation.*

The inquiry, which includes an analysis of [Mr. Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm)’s public statements and an examination of spending records, was approved in November by [Jeanine Pirro](https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/staff-profile/meet-us-attorney), a longtime ally of [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) who was appointed to run the office last year, the officials said.

Around the time the news started to reach the public, [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) [issued a roughly two-minute video statement](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20260111a.htm) statement, speaking directly to the camera, confirming that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) on Friday had served the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) with grand jury subpoenas, threatening a criminal indictment.

[Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) also explained the obvious motivation behind the developments: “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). This is about whether the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions, or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.”

The chair’s statement represented the initial pushback against [Team Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s gambit, but additional elements soon followed. On Wall Street, for example, [stock market futures fell](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-sp-500-nasdaq-01-12-2026?mod=WSJ_home_mediumtopper_pos_4), the dollar weakened, gold prices spiked, and the Vix index (sometimes referred to in financial circles as the “panic index”) jumped.

Let’s not forget that last spring when [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) talked openly about possibly firing [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm), markets dropped and the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [quickly backed off](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-jerome-powell-termination-no-plans-federal-reserve-rcna202577), claiming he hadn’t said what everyone heard him say.

As the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) eyes possible trumped-up, bad-faith criminal charges against [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm), the circumstances are far worse.

A political backlash is brewing too. [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) leaders wasted little time in condemning the developments, but the pushback [wasn’t entirely partisan](https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/11/doj-probe-fed-powell-statements-headquarters-00721679). [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Thom Tillis (T-NC)](https://www.tillis.senate.gov/), a member of the [Senate Banking Committee](http://www.banking.senate.gov/public), said in a statement, “If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [Administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) are actively pushing to end the independence of the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/), there should now be none. It is now the independence and credibility of the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) that are in question.”

Just as notably, the senator said he would “oppose the confirmation of any nominee for the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) — including the upcoming [Fed Chair](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/default.htm) vacancy — until this legal matter is fully resolved.”

But as important as these elements are, it’s worth appreciating the profound damage [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his team are doing to the rule of law as the dust settles on the news.

The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) hasn’t merely [seized control of the Justice Department](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jd-vance-says-a-bit-too-much-about-white-house-control-over-the-justice-department), it’s also embraced the idea that the levers of prosecutorial power are just another political tool to be used against those who bother [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) or get in his way.

The [The list is long](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-retribution-tracker/) and growing. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has a problem with [Minnesota](https://www.mn.gov/) [Gov.](https://mn.gov/governor/) [Tim Walz](https://mn.gov/governor/about-gov/timwalz/)? [Prosecute him](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/for-the-white-house-tim-walzs-decision-not-to-run-for-re-election-isnt-enough). [New York](https://www.ny.gov/) [Attorney General](https://ag.ny.gov/) [Letitia James](https://ag.ny.gov/about/meet-letitia-james) tries to hold [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) accountable? [Prosecute her](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/one-thing-letitia-james-james-comey-indictments-common-rcna236837). Former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Director James Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/james-b-comey) upsets [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)? [Prosecute him](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/one-thing-letitia-james-james-comey-indictments-common-rcna236837). [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) [Governor Lisa Cook](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/cook.htm) stands in the way of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s agenda? [Prosecute her](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-case-feds-lisa-cook-goes-bad-worse-rcna231451).

The obvious corruption of the justice system is made worse by the fact that the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) isn’t making any meaningful effort to hide the corruption.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) doesn’t appear to be the least bit concerned about appearances or a pretense of propriety. He’s abusing the system. He knows he’s abusing the system. He knows that we know he’s abusing the system — but he’s doing it anyway.

It’s easy to believe that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his confederates aren’t hiding their weaponization of the criminal justice system because they want everyone to notice. They need federal officials and [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) critics to be afraid, and other federal prosecutors to understand that they’ll soon be unemployed unless they play ball with the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) agenda.

The corruption is the point.

There might be half-hearted denials, issued with winks and nods, but by design, everyone should be painfully aware of what is plainly true: The authoritarian crisis has arrived, and it’s getting worse. We now live in a country where the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s opponents are pursued by prosecutors in brazen displays of partisan power.

### [Statement from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell - Federal Reserve Board](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20260111a.htm)

January 11, 2026

Good evening.

On Friday, the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) served the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) with grand jury subpoenas, threatening a criminal indictment related to my testimony before the [Senate Banking Committee](http://www.banking.senate.gov/) last June. That testimony concerned in part a multi-year project to renovate historic [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) office buildings.

I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy. No one—certainly not the chair of the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/)—is above the law. But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)'s threats and ongoing pressure.

This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) buildings. It is not about [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/)'s oversight role; the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) through testimony and other public disclosures made every effort to keep [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts. The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the [President](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).

This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions—or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.

I have served at the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) under four [administrations](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/), [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) and [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) alike. In every case, I have carried out my duties without political fear or favor, focused solely on our mandate of price stability and maximum employment. Public service sometimes requires standing firm in the face of threats. I will continue to do the job the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) confirmed me to do, with integrity and a commitment to serving the American people.

Thank you.
