*International leaders are realizing the most powerful person in the world is a danger and a threat.*

Jan. 21, 2026, 1:06 PM EST
By [Chris Hayes](https://www.ms.now/author/chris-hayes)

This is an adapted excerpt from the [Jan. 20](https://www.ms.now/all) episode of “All In with Chris Hayes.”

It has been one year since [Donald Trump](https://www.ms.now/white-house) took office, and it has been brutal in many ways.

Masked, armed federal immigration officers are subjecting the residents of [Minneapolis](https://www.minneapolismn.gov/) to a [violent and lawless occupation](https://www.ms.now/opinion/minneapolis-ice-watch-protesters-violence-research). [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is musing about [sending American soldiers](https://www.ms.now/way-too-early/watch/pentagon-puts-troops-on-standby-for-possible-minneapolis-deployment-2482089027527) into the state and [investigating local elected leaders](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-doj-to-investigate-walz-and-frey-but-not-ice-agent-who-shot-renee-good).

While that’s happening, the [economy is deteriorating](https://www.ms.now/news/trump-declares-economic-boom-as-inflation-persists), from unemployment to inflation to the tariffs the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has levied. On Tuesday alone, the [the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped](https://www.marketwatch.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-sp500-nasdaq-dive-trump-greenland-tariff-gold-record-netflic-earnings/card/dow-falls-more-than-900-points-as-stocks-hover-at-session-lows-is-it-time-to-buy-the-dip--157OhTSkFEN59Sg4d6oz?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqdPNawWaQ7MmG_ijuPrUPGXyo1uehWeaJsZS5amjyBn1pA-2pQ2VQ4WcB9YDvA%3D&gaa_ts=69710050&gaa_sig=DiPmlCziuDLtPaXMhnm_a4TJh5VzTKbKO_ekKh8du2aVo6GsLCjyLuYPYxVCqqFLuN4MzON_XH7nkCKvySPKsA%3D%3D) almost 900 points.

> **“The powerful have their power. But we have something too: the capacity to stop pretending, to name realities, to build our strength at home, and to act together.”** <br /><br />[Canadian](https://www.canada.ca/) [Prime Minister](https://www.pm.gc.ca/) [Mark Carney](https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/about)

Just in the past month, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has seized and [captured the president of Venezuela](https://www.ms.now/news/venezuela-strikes-legal-justification-trump), brought him to the U.S. to stand trial and announced that we are [taking the country’s oil and selling it](https://www.ms.now/opinion/venezuela-oil-iraq-trump) to put the proceeds in a private offshore bank account that he controls.

Our closest allies in Europe are [preparing for a possible war](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/world/europe/europe-troops-greenland-trump.html) with us because [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wants somebody to give him [Greenland](https://naalakkersuisut.gl/) — and a [Nobel Peace Prize](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-connects-his-greenland-crusade-to-his-failure-to-win-a-nobel-peace-prize).

That obsession and its consequences were on full display in [Davos, Switzerland](https://www.ms.now/news/trump-repeats-greenland-demand-in-davos-speech-while-seeming-to-rule-out-using-force-to-get-it), on Tuesday. The annual meeting of world leaders became an emergency summit to deal with an American [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) who is acting like an evil madman.

They have tried coddling [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) like a toddler. But now they are facing the ominous fact that Americans have been staring in the face for a year: The [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) is a nuclear-armed superpower run by a would-be tyrant.

Some of [America](https://www.usa.gov/)’s closest allies are now talking about the president like an enemy.  Things are so dire that [Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly3d28p4p8o) gave one of the best, most clear-eyed, sober, urgent speeches I have heard a politician deliver in a very, very long time — and certainly not the usual kind of speech that we hear at places like [Davos](https://www.gemeindedavos.ch/).

“Great powers have begun using economic integration as weapons: tariffs as leverage, financial infrastructure as coercion, supply chains as vulnerabilities to be exploited,” [Carney](https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/about) said. “When we only negotiate bilaterally with a hegemon, we negotiate from weakness. We accept what’s offered. We compete with each other to be the most accommodating.”

“This is not sovereignty; it’s the performance of sovereignty while accepting subordination,” he continued. “The powerful have their power. But we have something too: the capacity to stop pretending, to name realities, to build our strength at home and to act together.”

It wasn’t just world leaders. Visitors in [Davos](https://www.gemeindedavos.ch/) could see a glow in the snow-capped mountains after the sun set, when a group of 10 local residents hiked up the mountain with 450 torches to spell out one message: “No Kings.”

On Tuesday, while the rest of the world was describing [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) as the biggest threat to peace and stability in the world, the president was exactly where you would expect him to be: [at a White House podium](https://www.ms.now/news/trump-news-conference-economy-greenland-immigration), for an hour and 44 minutes, boasting about his year of accomplishments.

The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) conveniently typed up and printed out a big stack of paper sheets for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to read from, listing his [supposed accomplishments](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2026/01/365-wins-in-365-days-president-trumps-return-marks-new-era-of-success-prosperity/). The bullet points included No. 243, “Stripped notorious crackhead and grifter Hunter Biden of his taxpayer-funded [Secret Service](https://www.secretservice.gov/) detail,” and No. 245, “Signed an executive order to end the use of paper straws.”

All of this comes days after [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) announced he was forming a “[Board of Peace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLZvCBXp6YY)” to supplant the United Nations. The board would be run by him, and member states would be charged \$1 billion to have a permanent seat on the council.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has already invited heads of state like [Vladimir Putin](http://putin.kremlin.ru/), [Xi Jinping](https://www.gov.cn/) and [Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.gov.il/en/pages/netanyahu-b), and strong-arm leaders from nations like [Hungary](https://kormany.hu/) and [Belarus](https://president.gov.by/), to join.

Over the weekend, the president also received a text from the [prime minister](https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dep/smk/organisasjonskart/statsminister-jonas-gahr-store/id2877186/) of [Norway](https://www.regjeringen.no/) seeking to ease tensions with the U.S. over its positions on [Greenland](https://naalakkersuisut.gl/), Gaza and [Ukraine](https://www.kmu.gov.ua/). [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [responded by text](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-connects-his-greenland-crusade-to-his-failure-to-win-a-nobel-peace-prize), saying, in part:

> _Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the [Nobel Peace Prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/) for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the [United States of America](https://www.usa.gov/)._

This is an obvious point that has been made a ton, but the U.S. electing [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is not just our problem. We have made it the world’s problem, because we made ourselves the center of the global order.

The postwar global order was predicated on U.S. hegemony. That power has been abused in all sorts of awful, bloody and unforgivable ways, from Vietnam to Iraq. But it was the ordering principle we took from the big lesson of [World War II](https://www.ms.now/morning-joe/watch/joe-america-today-is-stronger-than-it-has-ever-been-due-to-international-order-we-set-up-after-wwii-2482509891819), which is that autocratic regimes, expansionist empires and fascists will create global conflicts, and you need the world’s oldest, most stable democracy at the center of it to prevent that.

The best way to understand the postwar liberal order is that it’s really a World War Avoidance Machine.

What we are dealing with is what happens when the winners of World War II realize that the order they built is crumbling and that the global hegemon is sounding — and maybe acting — like an Axis power.

The U.S.’ allies are gaining a daunting awareness that Americans in the anti-[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) camp have had from Day 1, when the president unilaterally [pardoned all the Jan. 6 insurrectionists](https://www.ms.now/opinion/trump-jan-6-pardons-brian-cole-jr) who had stormed the Capitol on his behalf in 2021. They are becoming aware that the most powerful person in the world is a danger and a threat and is destabilizing the world order.

And that means we’re all in a lot of trouble.
