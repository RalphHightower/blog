## [Why the White House shifted its tone on Renee Good and the deadly ICE shooting](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/why-the-white-house-shifted-its-tone-on-renee-good-and-the-deadly-ice-shooting)

*The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) said Good should be seen as a “deranged lunatic.” Then the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) learned of her father’s politics.*

As recently as last week, the [the official White House line](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/the-white-house-wants-the-left-to-stop-sounding-so-much-like-trump) was that Renee Good, the [Minnesota](https://www.mn.gov/)n who was shot and killed by an [Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent](https://www.ice.gov/), deserved to be seen as a “deranged lunatic” who was engaged in “domestic terrorism.”

During his mind-numbing [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) press conference Tuesday, [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) adopted a very different tone, saying that he “felt terribly” about what transpired.

[ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) agents, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) said, are “going to make mistakes sometimes. [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) is going to be too rough with somebody. … They’re going to make a mistake. Sometimes it can happen.”

Specifically referring to Good, he called her death a “tragedy” and a “horrible thing” — before getting to the heart of the matter.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) explained that he’d learned that the victim’s father “was a tremendous [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) fan,” referring to himself in the third person. “He was all for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). Love [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). … A lot of people said, ‘Oh, he loves you.’”

The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) concluded, “I hope he still feels that way.”

It was a painful reminder that to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s way of thinking, one of the most notable things about Good was how much one of her relatives liked him. The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) was perfectly comfortable with his [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) publicly condemning the victim, right up until he discovered her father’s political views, at which point it became time for a shift — which is every bit as morally vacuous as it sounds.

And then, speaking of the [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) shooting that took Good’s life, [the Republican concluded](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-press-conference-briefing-room-january-20-2026/), “It just happens.”

No, it does not. We’re not talking about a natural disaster, we’re talking about an act of deadly violence perpetrated by a federal agent against an unarmed civilian.

What’s more, if the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) genuinely believes that [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) agents are “going to make mistakes sometimes,” he could support federal investigations into such “mistakes.”

Except, in this instance, that’s not happening. Despite the fact that, [according to The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2026/01/18/fbi-minnesota-shooting-civil-rights-investigation/), an [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) agent in [Minnesota](https://www.mn.gov/) conducted an initial review of the shooting “and determined that sufficient grounds existed to open a civil rights probe into the actions of Jonathan Ross, the officer who shot Good,” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) quickly decided [to shut down any additional federal scrutiny](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-doj-to-investigate-walz-and-frey-but-not-ice-agent-who-shot-renee-good) of what transpired.

Indeed, we’re left with a related question that the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has so far failed to address: If [Team Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has decided there will be no federal investigation into the Good killing, will [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) officials agree to get out of the way of state and local law enforcement, which remain interested in learning what happened?
