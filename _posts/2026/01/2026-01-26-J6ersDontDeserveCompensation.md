## [With pardons in hand, many Jan. 6 rioters are demanding taxpayer-funded compensation](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/with-pardons-in-hand-many-jan-6-rioters-are-demanding-taxpayer-funded-compensation)

*Many paid restitution to the government. Now with the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s blessing, money may flow the other way.*

Jan. 21, 2026, 12:45 PM EST
By [Steve Benen](https://www.ms.now/author/steve-benen)

The day after the [Jan. 6 attack]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}), [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com) was under enormous political pressure, with some [congressional](https://www.congress.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) openly talking about trying to remove him from office before the end of his term. In damage-control mode, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) delivered public remarks, reading carefully from a prepared text.

“The demonstrators who infiltrated the [Capitol](https://www.aoc.gov/) have defiled the seat of American democracy,” [Trump said](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/testimony-sheds-new-light-trumps-jan-7-speech-rcna35908), taking a position he’s since rejected. He added, “To those who engage in the acts of violence and destruction: You do not represent our country, and to those who broke the law: You will pay.”

Five years later, it appears he misspoke. “You will pay” has given way to “We will pay you.” [The Washington Post reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2026/01/21/trump-january-6-pardon-refunds/):

> _At least eight [Jan. 6 defendants]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}) are pursuing refunds of the financial penalties paid as part of their sentences, according to a [Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) review of court records. … Others are filing civil lawsuits against the government seeking millions of dollars, alleging politically tainted prosecutions and violations of their constitutional rights. Hundreds more have filed claims accusing the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/), the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) and other law enforcement agencies of inflicting property damage and personal injuries, according to their lawyer._

By all appearances, the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) thinks this is a great idea. Indeed (as if [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) hadn’t already done enough for [Jan. 6 rioters]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %})), the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) broke new ground last spring when he [endorsed the idea](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-jan-6-compensation-fund-pardons-rcna198151) of a possible “compensation fund” for those who attacked the [U.S. Capitol](https://www.aoc.gov/) in his name. He didn’t elaborate on the details, but taken at face value, he appeared to be describing what would effectively be [financial rewards for the criminals](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-jan-6-compensation-fund-pardons-rcna198151) he pardoned.

Weeks later, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) brought the effort into focus, arguing in a court filing that pardoned [Jan. 6 defendants]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}) are [entitled to a refund of restitution payments](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-justice-department-backs-reimbursements-jan-6-criminals-rcna200590) they made to cover damage to the [Capitol](https://www.aoc.gov/).

In August, a federal judge [grudgingly authorized](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/first-time-jan-6-rioter-gets-refund-paid-restitution-rcna228010) a \$2,200 refund to a [Jan. 6 rioter]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}) whose felony conviction was undone by [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). Now others are lining up for similar payments.

[New York](https://www.ny.gov/) [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Joe Morelle (D-NY25)](https://morelle.house.gov/), the top [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) on the [House Administration Committee](https://cha.house.gov/), which oversees the [Capitol](https://www.aoc.gov/)’s security and operations, told the [Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/), “[Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) want taxpayers to reimburse a violent mob for the destruction of the [U.S. Capitol](https://www.aoc.gov/). The [Jan. 6 nightmare]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}) continues.”

A [USA Today report](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/09/january-6-defendants-reimbursed-capitol-fines/83008661007/?tbref=hp) explained last year, “Most defendants convicted for the [Capitol](https://www.aoc.gov/) insurrection were required to pay restitution to the Architect of the [Capitol](https://www.aoc.gov/), who maintains the building and grounds, to help cover the costs of repairing the estimated \$3 million in damage. Those convicted of felonies typically paid \$2,000 and those convicted of misdemeanors typically paid \$500.”

There’s still some question as to just how much money has been recovered, but the Post’s report said the total is less than \$665,000.

Now, with the support of the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/), money is poised to start flowing in the opposite direction.

[Sens.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Alex Padilla (D-CA)](https://www.padilla.senate.gov/) and [Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI)](https://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/) are championing legislation to prevent rioters from receiving government payouts. The bill, however, is likely to fail for the most obvious of reasons: It’s a [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)-led [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/), and the proposal has no [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) cosponsors.
