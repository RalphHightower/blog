## [What Mark Carney's Davos speech got wrong about Trump](https://www.ms.now/opinion/mark-carney-davos-trump-greenland-nato-europe)

*Perhaps this time is different. But what [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has seemingly broken can still be put back together again.*

Jan. 22, 2026, 7:09 AM EST
By [Michael A. Cohen](https://www.ms.now/author/michael-a-cohen-2)

[America](https://www.usa.gov/)’s Western allies have had enough — or so they say. 

This week at the [World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/) in [Davos](https://www.gemeindedavos.ch/), [Switzerland](https://www.admin.ch/gov/), one world leader after another expressed frustration with the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) over its increasingly hostile behavior toward them and called for a new path forward.

According to [European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2026/01/21/trump-greenland-europe-allies-nato/), it’s time for [Europe](https://european-union.europa.eu/) to seek a permanent break with the U.S. “Nostalgia will not bring back the old order,” said [von der Leyen](https://commission.europa.eu/about/organisation/president_en). “It’s time to seize this opportunity and build a new independent [Europe](https://european-union.europa.eu/).”

> **If all this talk sounds familiar, it’s because we’ve heard it before.**

“So many red lines are being crossed,” [said](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2026/01/21/trump-greenland-europe-allies-nato/) [Belgian](https://federale-regering.be/nl) [Prime Minister Bart De Wever](https://premier.be/nl) in response to [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s threat to impose tariffs over [Greenland](https://naalakkersuisut.gl/), “that you have the choice between your self-respect — being a happy vassal is one thing. Being a miserable slave is something else.” 

“[Europe](https://european-union.europa.eu/) has very strong tools now, and we have to use them when we are not respected,” [huffed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2026/01/21/trump-greenland-europe-allies-nato/) [French](https://www.info.gouv.fr/) [President](https://www.elysee.fr/) [Emmanuel Macron](https://www.elysee.fr/emmanuel-macron).

But perhaps the most direct criticism of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) — and call for a new world order — came from [Canadian](https://www.canada.ca/) [Prime Minister](https://www.pm.gc.ca/) [Mark Carney](https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/about), who [told](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2026/01/davos-2026-special-address-by-mark-carney-prime-minister-of-canada/) the assembled global elite, “We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition.” [Carney](https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/about) declared that “great powers … using economic integration as weapons, tariffs as leverage, financial infrastructure as coercion, supply chains as vulnerabilities to be exploited,” cannot continue.

“We live in an era of great-power rivalry,” said [Carney](https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/about). “The rules-based order is fading,” and “middle powers [such as \[Canada](https://www.canada.ca/)] must act together because if we’re not at the table, we’re on the menu.”

These comments are the logical endpoint of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s first year in office, in which he has seemingly gone out of his way to stick a finger in the eye of key [NATO](https://www.nato.int/) allies and undermine some of [America](https://www.usa.gov/)’s most enduring and beneficial bilateral relationships. 

But if all this talk sounds familiar, it’s because we’ve heard it before.

In the waning days of the Cold War, [Luxembourg](https://gouvernement.lu/)’s [Prime Minister](https://gouvernement.lu/en/gouvernement/luc-frieden.html) and President of the [Council of Europe](https://www.coe.int/), Jacques Loos, infamously declared, “This is the hour of [Europe](https://european-union.europa.eu/), not the hour of the [America](https://www.usa.gov/)ns.”

In February 2003, as [America](https://www.usa.gov/) prepared to go to war in [Iraq](https://ur.gov.iq/) and U.S. leaders were sneering at [America](https://www.usa.gov/)’s “old” [European](https://european-union.europa.eu/) allies, French President Jacques Chirac [warned of a unipolar world](https://www.upi.com/Defense-News/2003/03/20/Chirac-regrets-Iraq-war/72551048160970/) dominated by the U.S. and said “[Europe](https://european-union.europa.eu/) must realize the importance of expressing its own vision of world problems and of supporting it with a common, credible defense.”

In 2017, after a disastrous G-7 summit with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), [German Chancellor](https://www.bundeskanzler.de/) [Angela Merkel said](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/28/merkel-says-europe-must-take-our-fate-into-our-own-hands-after-tough-g-7-nato-meetings.html?), “The days when [Europe](https://european-union.europa.eu/) could rely on others were over,” and argued that [Europe](https://european-union.europa.eu/) must take its fate into its own hands.

But a funny thing happened next.

Loos was referring to the unfolding war in the former Yugoslavia, and while many [European](https://european-union.europa.eu/) leaders believed that the time had come for [Europe](https://european-union.europa.eu/) to look after its own continent’s affairs, it was U.S. military might combined with diplomatic heft that brought an end to the conflict in the Balkans.

**Perhaps this time is different, and [America](https://www.usa.gov/)’s allies have reached their breaking point with [America](https://www.usa.gov/)’s bullying and dalliance with unilateralism. But skepticism is warranted.** 

In 2009, when [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Barack Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) replaced [George W. Bush](https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/) in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), [Europe](https://european-union.europa.eu/) returned to the tried-and-true paradigm of following [America](https://www.usa.gov/)’s lead on the world stage. In 2021, when [Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) arrived in the [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), the same pattern emerged again. And when [Russia](http://government.ru/) invaded [Ukraine](https://www.kmu.gov.ua/) in 2022, it was once again the U.S. that took the lead in assembling a [European](https://european-union.europa.eu/) coalition to oppose [Vladimir Putin](http://kremlin.ru/)’s military aggression.

Perhaps this time is different, and [America](https://www.usa.gov/)’s allies have reached their breaking point with [America](https://www.usa.gov/)’s bullying and dalliance with unilateralism. But skepticism is warranted. 

As [Chris Fettweis](https://liberalarts.tulane.edu/political-science/people/faculty-staff/christopher-fettweis), a professor of international affairs at [Tulane University](https://tulane.edu/), said to me, “People always think we’re on the cusp of a new world order … and they’re usually wrong.”

Indeed, one striking element of [Carney](https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/about)’s [Davos](https://www.gemeindedavos.ch/) speech was how powerfully the [Canadian](https://www.canada.ca/) prime minister spoke about the importance of multilateralism and the dangers of great powers going it alone. “A world of fortresses,” he said, “will be poorer, more fragile and less sustainable. … If great powers abandon even the pretense of rules and values for the unhindered pursuit of their power and interests, the gains from transactionalism will become harder to replicate.”

[Carney](https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/about)’s vision of multilateralism, laid out in [Davos](https://www.gemeindedavos.ch/), was offered as a hedge against [America](https://www.usa.gov/)n bullying and a path for middle-power countries to follow, so long as [America](https://www.usa.gov/) is in the grip of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s mania and know-nothingness. 

In recent weeks, [Canada](https://www.canada.ca/) has acted on [Carney](https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/about)’s words. [Ottawa](https://ottawa.ca/) has reduced trade barriers with [China](https://www.china.gov/), including a deal last week with [Beijing](https://www.beijing.gov.cn/) that will increase the importation of electric vehicles in return for [China](https://www.china.gov/) easing restrictions on [Canadian](https://www.canada.ca/) agricultural imports. [French](https://www.info.gouv.fr/) [President](https://www.elysee.fr/) [Emmanuel Macron](https://www.elysee.fr/emmanuel-macron) also spoke in [Davos](https://www.gemeindedavos.ch/) of [encouraging more Chinese investment](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202601/1353787.shtml) in [Europe](https://european-union.europa.eu/). 
[French](https://www.info.gouv.fr/) [President](https://www.elysee.fr/) [Emmanuel Macron](https://www.elysee.fr/emmanuel-macron)
But [Carney](https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/about) surely knows that for [Canada](https://www.canada.ca/), which is so uniquely dependent on the U.S. as a trading partner, a partnership of middle powers won’t outweigh a full [America](https://www.usa.gov/)n heel turn toward rogue nation status. The same is almost certainly true of [Europe](https://european-union.europa.eu/). [America](https://www.usa.gov/)’s allies might be exasperated by [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s behavior, but they, too, prefer a return to the status quo over any other potential outcome. 

Great and occasionally benevolent powers like the U.S. do not grow on trees, and an economic and political alliance with [China](https://www.china.gov/) for [Canada](https://www.canada.ca/) and [Europe](https://european-union.europa.eu/) is not really on the table.

Indeed, there was another implicit message in [Carney](https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/about)’s words — and indeed they can be heard in the words of nearly every [European](https://european-union.europa.eu/) leader who decries what [America](https://www.usa.gov/) has become: Come back to reality! 

> **All that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has seemingly broken can still be put back together again.** 

For all of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s excesses and belligerent rhetoric, he has left mostly hurt feelings in his wake. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) hasn’t pulled the U.S. out of [NATO](https://www.nato.int/). He has largely maintained [American](https://www.usa.gov/) support for Ukraine. And on Wednesday night, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) announced he was calling off his threatened trade war with [Europe](https://european-union.europa.eu/) after having “formed the framework of a future deal with respect to [Greenland](https://naalakkersuisut.gl/)” — which [The New York Times reports](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/us/politics/trump-greenland-threats-diplomacy-force.html?smid=url-share) will likely be little more than “a compromise in which [Denmark](https://regeringen.dk/) would give the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) sovereignty over small pockets of [Greenland](https://naalakkersuisut.gl/)ic land where the [United States](https://www.usa.gov/) could build military bases.”

In other words, all that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has seemingly broken can still be put back together again. 

[Canadian](https://www.canada.ca/) and [European](https://european-union.europa.eu/) leaders are no doubt frustrated and infuriated by how uncertain an ally the U.S. has become and by how frequently this pattern of misbehavior has repeated itself over the past 25 years. 

But make no mistake, they would almost certainly welcome a sane [America](https://www.usa.gov/) back with open arms.
