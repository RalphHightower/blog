## [‘I’m never going to back down’: Mark Kelly pushes back against Hegseth’s intensifying crusade](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/mark-kelly-demotion-pete-hegseth-010626)


*The [Pentagon](https://www.defense.gov/) [chief](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) is moving forward with plans to demote the senator’s military rank. The [secretary](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/)  may not be prepared, however, for what happens next.*

Jan. 6, 2026, 9:10 AM EST
By [Steve Benen](https://www.ms.now/author/steve-benen)

In mid-December, the [Pentagon](https://www.defense.gov/) announced that [Defense](https://www.defense.gov/) [Secretary Pete Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) was “escalating” his crusade against [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Mark Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/), launching an “official Command Investigation” into the [Arizona Democrat](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/). It was, as [The Washington Post noted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/12/15/hegseth-mark-kelly-investigation/) soon after, “an unprecedented use of the military justice system to investigate a political adversary.”

Three weeks later, the beleaguered [Cabinet secretary](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/), who presumably has [more important matters](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/were-in-charge-trump-undercuts-rubio-claims-control-over-venezuela) on his plate, took the next step down a radical path. My [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/) colleague [Erum Salam reported](https://www.ms.now/news/hegseth-aims-to-reduce-sen-mark-kellys-military-rank-and-pension):

[Defense](https://www.defense.gov/) [Secretary Pete Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) announced Monday that he plans to demote the military rank of [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Mark Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/) of Arizona after the retired [Navy](https://www.navy.mil/) captain reminded those actively serving to disobey illegal orders. […]

[Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) said he issued a ‘letter of censure’ to [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/), calling it a first step toward a demotion and a decrease in pension. Censure is a formal disciplinary action, sometimes punitive, that can only be issued by someone in a service member’s chain of command. If successful, it can result in demotion of a service member’s rank and a reduction in their retirement pay.

For those who might have lost sight of the transgression that prompted the secretary’s crusade: Several Democratic military veterans appeared in a video, released in November, in which they urged service members to [reject illegal orders](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-house-targets-democratic-veterans-told-troops-refuse-illegal-ord-rcna244954). A week later, [Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) [announced an investigation](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/pete-hegseth-investigationmark-kelly) into [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/), a decorated Navy veteran. (The [Arizona Democrat](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/) is the only member of the group who retired as a captain and served long enough to receive a military pension.)

The campaign against [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/) is awfully tough to defend: All the senator and his colleagues did was to remind service members to follow the law and the [Uniform Code of Military Justice](https://jsc.defense.gov/Portals/99/Documents/UCMJ%20-%2020December2019.pdf), echoing comments [Hegseth himself made](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/in-prior-remarks-hegseth-and-bondi-also-said-troops-must-disobey-illegal-orders) made before he joined Donald Trump’s Cabinet.

On the surface, this might appear to be the latest in a series of steps on the White House’s so-called revenge tour, but this particular partisan fight is a bit more complex.

It’s not just about [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/): As [the senator said](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow/watch/why-donald-trump-is-still-freaking-out-over-senator-kelly-s-simple-statement-2479723075702) on [“The Rachel Maddow Show”](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show) hours after [Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/)’s announcement, the defense secretary is taking steps “to try to silence me, silence other members of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/), silence retired members of the military, former service members, really silence the American people. I mean, this isn’t only about me; this is about all of us.”

It’s an important detail: By targeting a senator who urged military personnel to follow the law, [Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) is sending a signal to service members everywhere — retired and active duty — that they too could be targeted if they speak out in ways [Team Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)doesn’t like.

What happened to the court-martial? [Hegseth emphasized](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/the-disturbing-precursor-to-team-trumps-offensive-against-sen-mark-kelly) several weeks ago that the [Pentagon](https://www.defense.gov/) might recall [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/) to active service in order to face a court martial. The secretary has since [backed away](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2026/01/05/hegseth-mark-kelly-censure-pentagon-court-martial/88029585007/?tbref=hp) from this gambit for the most obvious of reasons: He surely knows that the court-martial process would bring this matter to a jury, which would recognize the political crusade as a baseless sham.

The [Pentagon](https://www.defense.gov/) chief appears to prefer a process that he can control and that can lead to punitive outcomes he can dictate.

Blurry partisan lines: As [Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/)’s campaign against [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/) advanced in the fall, the[Democratic senator received some unexpected support from some of his Republican colleagues](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/as-pete-hegseth-advances-retaliatory-investigation-mark-kelly-picks-up-gop-backing). This week, that continued: Two [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) senators — [Maine](https://www.maine.gov/)’s [Susan Collins](https://www.collins.senate.gov/) and [North Carolina](https://www.nc.gov/)’s [Thom Tillis](https://www.tillis.senate.gov/) — [separately criticized](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5673860-republican-senators-defend-mark-kelly/) [Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/)’s latest moves on Monday, with [Tillis](https://www.tillis.senate.gov/) going so far as to characterize the defense secretary’s announcement as “ridiculous.”

[Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/)’s pushback: If [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Pentagon](https://www.defense.gov/) expects [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/) to back down in the face of absurd bullying, that’s apparently not going to happen. “Here’s the thing, Rachel: I’m never going to back down from these guys,” the senator said Monday on [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/). “I’m going to continue to speak out. I’m going to continue to do my job and, as much as I can, highlight how wrong these people are and how outrageous this is and how dangerous.”

Will the crusade backfire? As [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/) weighs his future political and electoral options, the [Pentagon](https://www.defense.gov/) chief is making him more popular, more visible and, as of this week, more eager to use his mailing list for a fresh round of fundraising. Whether [Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) realizes this or not, his target might very well end up benefiting from the secretary’s offensive.

Endgame: As part of the existing process, [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/) has 30 days to respond formally to [Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/)’s letter, but just as notably, assuming his demotion happens, the senator will have the option of taking the matter to the courts, to the [Board for Correction of Naval Records](https://www.secnav.navy.mil/mra/bcnr/pages/default.aspxz) or to both.

“If the executive branch were to move forward in any forum — criminal, disciplinary, or administrative — we will take all appropriate legal action on [Senator Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/)’s behalf to halt the [Administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s unprecedented and dangerous overreach,” [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/)’s lawyer wrote in a letter to [Secretary of the Navy John Phelan](https://www.secnav.navy.mil/Pages/Bio.aspx) in December.
