## [Mike Johnson brags about ‘a great year.’ House Republicans are discussing his replacement.](https://www.ms.now/news/mike-johnson-great-year-house-republicans-discussing-replacement)

*Other than the reconciliation bill, [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) say they have little to show for their time controlling Washington.*

Jan. 5, 2026, 5:00 AM EST
By [Mychael Schnell](https://www.ms.now/author/mychael-schnell)

In a [Wall Street Journal op-ed](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/house-republicans-had-a-great-year-04efce46) op-ed published last week, [Speaker](https://speaker.house.gov/) [Mike Johnson (T-LA4)](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) declared 2025 “a great year” for [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/), calling it “one of the most productive first years of any [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) in our lifetimes.”

But in interviews with more than a dozen [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) last week, a far less rosy picture emerged. And as lawmakers prepare to return for what could be the final year of unified [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) control in [Washington](https://dc.gov/) during [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s presidency — if [current polling](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/polls/congressional-vote-2026.html) holds — some members are already talking privately about new [House](https://www.house.gov/) leadership in the next [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/).

For [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/), the case for [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) success rests almost entirely on one accomplishment: the reconciliation bill. [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) passed the legislation this summer, with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) signing it into law on July Fourth. In his op-ed, [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) highlighted the package’s tax cuts, the billions in new border enforcement funding and the more than \$1 trillion in cuts to [Medicaid](https://www.medicaid.gov/). 

The [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) who spoke to [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/) agreed the reconciliation bill was a major accomplishment for their party. (It’s worth noting that no [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) took issue with any of the policies that became law in the reconciliation bill, like the tax cuts that are [projected to reduce tax revenue by \$4.5 trillion](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/explainer/what-does-the-one-big-beautiful-bill-cost/) over the next decade or those [Medicaid](https://www.medicaid.gov/) cuts that are projected to cause 10.9 million Americans to lose health insurance coverage over that same time period.) But many of these [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) wondered what the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) had accomplished since. 

Beyond overseeing the longest government shutdown in history and passing a few mandatory bills, many [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) said they have little to show for their time controlling the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and both chambers of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/).

“The latter half of the year, in particular, starting with the speaker’s baffling decision to keep the [House](https://www.house.gov/) out of session for two months while the country was mired in a very harmful shutdown, that did not really match the tone of the op-ed,” [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Kevin Kiley (T-CA3)](https://kiley.house.gov/) told [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/).

[Kiley](https://kiley.house.gov/), a frequent [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) critic, said the low productivity during the second half of the year was a consequence of the speaker choosing to keep the [House](https://www.house.gov/) out of session during the historic 43-day government shutdown.

“The decision to absent the [House](https://www.house.gov/) from [Washington](https://dc.gov/) for two months and cancel six great weeks of session,” [Kiley](https://kiley.house.gov/) said, “I’m not sure the speaker or the [House](https://www.house.gov/) really recovered from that at the end of 2025.”

A second [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republican](https://www.gop.com/), who spoke to [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/) on the condition of anonymity, said the tax cuts delivered through the reconciliation bill were good. “But other than that, like, what else have we done?” the member asked. “Like, I can’t tell you, because we haven’t.”

This [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) lawmaker added that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) had been very productive, particularly calling out what the [Treasury Department](https://home.treasury.gov/), the [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/) and the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) had been doing. “Quite the opposite story when you get to both chambers of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/),” this member said.

“I understand the point [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) is trying to make here,” another [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) told [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/), “but I don’t think his claims ring true for most Americans. With all due respect, this characterization does not reflect the reality facing the American people.”

This member added that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) won “a resounding victory in 2024 with a clear mandate,” and yet now, [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/)’ approval rating is near all-time lows and the American people are “rightly frustrated that we have not delivered more boldly on that mandate.”

And asked for their thoughts on [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/)’s op-ed, another [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) called it “a very rosy way of writing their own story.”

The frustration isn’t particularly surprising, given the lack of legislative progress in the second half of last year. But what may be notable, however, is that [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) are now discussing new leadership in the next [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/).

Yet another [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republican](https://www.gop.com/), who asked to remain anonymous to discuss the sensitive conversations, told [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/) that the current [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) leadership team “is generally viewed as weak, reactive and unintelligent.”

“It is the increasing sense across the entire continuum of the [Republican Conference](https://www.gop.gov/), from the [Freedom Caucus](https://freedomcaucus.org/) to the [Tuesday Group](https://republicangovernance.com/), that there is a need to elect an entirely new leadership team in the 120th [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/),” this member said, referring to the hard-line conservative and moderate [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) groups.

“Expect the silent majority in the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) conference to push for entirely new faces, and an entirely new approach, in the next [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/),” this lawmaker added. “We are already hearing from those who will move to force the legacy figures to step aside at the end of this [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/), and replace them with new, fresh faces — new ideas and a new approach.”

While these conversations are mostly happening behind the scenes — with little appetite to change leadership in the middle of this [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) — some of the chatter has been making its way into public view.

In early December, [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Elise Stefanik (T-NY21)](https://stefanik.house.gov/), a member of [House](https://www.house.gov/) [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) leadership and a close [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) ally, told [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/elise-stefanik-mike-johnson-house-speaker-c41659cb?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqeSntYTHzmTC0KKJMECqm9p65qlTkY8kYH7Ry29OvUZmiXHKKL5JMPGnng5ICk%3D&gaa_ts=69558ee9&gaa_sig=ezt86T4BF73bPEo_5gwrt--jVXS2SzfYnAxq_9NVfL0uhTYndbb20GGR0GPg1a7wSi9reYuO2IdcijYOjEeY3Q%3D%3D) in an interview that [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) “certainly wouldn’t have the votes to be speaker if there was a roll-call vote tomorrow.”

Of course, there isn’t a vote tomorrow. And if [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) loses the [House](https://www.house.gov/) majority, he would obviously face challenges to retain his position as the No. 1 [Republican](https://www.gop.com/). But if the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) were to somehow hold on to the majority, removing [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) would be difficult.

Still, another [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) lawmaker agreed with [Stefanik](https://stefanik.house.gov/)’s assessment that [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) would lose a vote tomorrow: “A good attorney. A good man. A bad politician,” this member said.

[Kiley](https://kiley.house.gov/) said there were “definitely frustrations” with [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/)’s leadership among a cross section of the conference. “I don’t discount how challenging the job is, but he seems to have done the one thing that frustrates pretty much everyone in our conference, by simply making the [House of Representatives](https://www.house.gov/) a lot less relevant in recent months,” Kiley said.

That decaying relevance has come as [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) has deferred much of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/)’ power to the executive branch. The legislative branch’s reduced role in the checks-and-balances system of government came into greater focus over the weekend, when [Trump bombed Venezuela and put U.S. boots on the ground](https://www.ms.now/news/trump-announces-military-strike-on-venezuela-capture-of-president-nicolas-maduro) and put U.S. boots on the ground to capture [Venezuelan](https://gob.ve/) [president Nicolás Maduro](https://presidencia.gob.ve/Site/Web/Principal/paginas/classPresidente.php) — without congressional authorization.

Where congressional leaders of previous eras might take issue with the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) conducting offensive strikes without authorization — or at least insist on congressional input — [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) applauded the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) Saturday for a “decisive and justified operation that will protect American lives.”

“[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is putting American lives first, succeeding where others have failed, and under his leadership the United States will no longer allow criminal regimes to profit from wreaking havoc and destruction on our country,” [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) [wrote on X](https://x.com/SpeakerJohnson/status/2007468765718384961?s=20).

[Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) has seemed to grasp that his power as a [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) leader depends greatly, if not entirely, on [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s approval. And as [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has seized power from the legislative branch — through [tariffs](https://www.ms.now/weekends-with-alex-witt/watch/trump-defends-tariffs-economy-despite-americans-souring-on-his-policies-2478673987825), through [impoundments](https://www.ms.now/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-budget-pocket-rescission-illegal-ruling-rcna229389), through [executive orders](https://www.ms.now/top-stories/latest/trump-executive-orders-day-1-list-rcna188264), through [emergency declarations](https://www.ms.now/katy-tur/watch/trump-uses-handful-of-emergency-declarations-to-justify-hundreds-of-actions-246603845910) and by his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) ignoring congressional orders — [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) has been an enthusiastic partner of the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).

Reached for comment, the speaker’s office referred [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/) to the message in the op-ed and the more than 100 influential conservative and industry and community leaders touting the [House](https://www.house.gov/) [GOP](https://www.gop.com/)’s accomplishments in 2025.

Still, the numbers paint a more humble picture.

With [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) controlling the [House](https://www.house.gov/), Senate and [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), 38 bills became law this year — exactly half of the 76 bills that were enacted under full [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)ic control in 2021 and far short of the 74 bills that were signed under full [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) control in 2017. (In 2009, when [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)s also had unified control of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) and the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), they passed 115 bills into law.)

[Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) wasn’t without defenders. Several [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) pointed out that [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) was grappling with a razor-thin majority — decreasing to a two-vote cushion at one point — which makes passing major legislation difficult.

[Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Eric Burlison (T-MO7](https://burlison.house.gov/), a second-term lawmaker who is part of the [Freedom Caucus](https://freedomcaucus.org/), called 2025 “one of the best years [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) has had.”

“While we may not have passed a bunch of individual bills, the amount of legislation, and good legislation, that was passed in the ‘one big, beautiful bill’ is quite a bit,” [Burlison](https://burlison.house.gov/) said.

He did, however, push back on [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/)’s description of 2025 as “one of the most productive first years of any [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) in our lifetime.”

“I don’t know if you’d say the most productive,” [Burlison](https://burlison.house.gov/) said. “I’d say it’s the best in at least a generation. And by best, I mean we didn’t pass a bunch of swampy things; we passed really good legislation.”

[Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Don Bacon, (T-NE2)](https://bacon.house.gov/), a retiring moderate, similarly touted the breadth of policy in the reconciliation bill, as well as the annual defense policy bill, which [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) has passed every year for more than six decades.

“If you just look at the number of bills passed, it’s easy to say, I guess, that’s a low production, but I think if you have a little bit of nuance, it was probably more than just that low number, because the reconciliation bill had tons of tax policy in it,” [Bacon](https://bacon.house.gov/) said, though he added that “the real answer” is that “I sure wish we could have got more done.”

Notably absent from the list of accomplishments? A fix for health care, as [Obamacare subsidies expired](https://www.ms.now/news/new-year-congress-obamacare-subsides-lapse), driving up prices for tens of millions of Americans.

“Substantively, what we’ve done, the biggest thing is that ‘big, beautiful bill,’” one of the previously quoted lawmakers said. “And the biggest deficiency is certainly the health care.”

At the end of his op-ed, [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) said “the best is yet to come.” But some [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) are just wishing for some normalcy.

Asked what they were most hopeful for in the second half of the 119th [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/), another one of the previously quoted lawmakers had a modest ambition: “Little or no drama.”
