## [Jack Smith deposition transcript released](https://www.ms.now/news/jack-smith-deposition-transcript-released)

*The former special counsel, who led two failed prosecutions of President Donald Trump, spoke before the House Judiciary Committee in mid-December.*

Dec. 31, 2025, 3:19 PM EST
By [Julianne McShane](https://www.ms.now/author/julianne-mcshane)

The [House Judiciary Committee](https://judiciary.house.gov/) on Wednesday [released](https://x.com/JudiciaryGOP/status/2006438988735983791?s=20) the transcript and video of its deposition with [former special counsel Jack Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith), who led two failed prosecutions of [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).

The closed-door deposition took place on Dec. 17 in [Washington, D.C.](https://dc.gov/) [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) was [appointed](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) to his former role in 2022 by then-[Attorney General Merrick Garland](https://www.justice.gov/ag/bio/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland) and [resigned earlier this year](https://www.ms.now/top-stories/latest/jack-smith-resigns-justice-department-trump-rcna187281), less than two weeks before [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) resumed office and just after [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) [completed a report that found](https://www.justice.gov/storage/Report-of-Special-Counsel-Smith-Volume-1-January-2025.pdf) the [department](https://www.justice.gov/) had enough evidence to convict [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) of election interference by working to overthrow his [2020 election loss](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf) to former [president Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/).

The day after [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) completed the deposition, his lawyers wrote a letter to [House Judiciary Committee](https://judiciary.house.gov/) [Chairman](http://judiciary.house.gov/the-committee/the-chairman) [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Jim Jordan (T-OH4)](https://jordan.house.gov/), asking him to release the full video of the deposition quickly, writing, “Doing so will ensure that the American people can hear the facts directly from [Mr. Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith), rather than through second-hand accounts.”

In the more than 250-page transcript, released on New Year’s Eve, [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) discusses the two criminal investigations of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) that he led: one that alleged [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) had interfered in the [2020 presidential election](https://www.justice.gov/storage/US_v_Trump_23_cr_257.pdf) by spreading false claims of widespread voter fraud and organizing fake slates of electors to subvert the results, and one alleging [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) improperly stored classified documents at his [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) estate in [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/) after his first term in office.

In the deposition, [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) called the [Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}) — when a huge mob of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) supporters invaded the [U.S. Capitol](https://www.congress.gov/), attacking police officers — “an attack on the structure of our democracy in which over 140 heroic law enforcement officers were assaulted.” He added that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) “was by a large measure the most culpable and most responsible person in this conspiracy.” The attack led to several deaths.

[Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) rejected the allegations — which have come from [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and other [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) — that he had political motivations in pursuing the election interference case against [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has [called Smith “a thug,” “a failed prosecutor,” and “a bad man, an evil man.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBW25VX0MSU)

“These crimes were committed for his benefit,” [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) said of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and Jan. 6. “The attack that happened at the [Capitol](https://www.congress.gov/), part of this case, does not happen without him. The other co-conspirators were doing this for his benefit. So in terms of why we would pursue a case against him, I entirely disagree with any characterization that our work was in any way meant to hamper him in the [Presidential election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf).”

[Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) said that there was “absolutely” a time he thought he might not bring an indictment, and added that he would have been “comfortable” with that outcome if the facts and the law didn’t add up.

[Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) also said that the strength of the election interference case came, in part, from the fact that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s own allies were prepared to testify against him.

“We had an elector in [Pennsylvania](https://www.pa.gov/) who is a former [Congressman](https://www.congress.gov/) who was going to be an elector for [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) who said that what they were trying to do was an attempt to overthrow the government and illegal,” [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) said. “Our case was built on, frankly, [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) who put their allegiance to the country before the party.”

Another ally was more high-profile: [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s then-lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) said participated in a recorded interview during which “he disavowed a number of the [voter-fraud] claims.” One of them was Ruby Freeman, one of two [Georgia](https://www.georgia.gov/) election workers to whom Giuliani was [ordered to pay nearly \$150 million](https://www.ms.now/top-stories/latest/rudy-giuliani-ruby-freeman-shaye-moss-defamation-settled-rcna193618) after spreading lies about their roles in the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf).

“He claimed they were mistakes or hyperbole, even the claim about Ruby Freeman, where he, you know, basically destroyed this poor woman’s life by claiming she was a vote scammer,” [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) said.

[Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) insisted [Attorney General Merrick Garland](https://www.justice.gov/ag/bio/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland) never pressured him to be more “aggressive” in his investigation of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), and that neither [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) Biden nor other White House officials told him they expected him to bring charges against [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). He also said he would have accepted the role of special counsel to investigate either [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) or former [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Barack Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/). And he said he does not believe the [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/)’s ruling on executive immunity “constitutes an exoneration” of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) in the weeks and months leading up to and on Jan. 6.

Under [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith)’s direction, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was indicted on four felony counts — including conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding — related to the election interference case on Aug. 1, 2023. That case was scheduled to go to trial, but [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s defense succeeded at delaying the start until after the [2024 presidential election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/2024presgeresults.pdf). The case was ultimately dismissed by the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) after [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) won his second term, due to a long-standing [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) policy that prevents sitting [presidents](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) from facing criminal prosecution.

The [classified documents](https://www.justice.gov/storage/Report-of-%20-Counsel-Smith-Volume-1-January-2025.pdf) case was dismissed last year by [U.S. District Judge](https://www.uscourts.gov/) [Aileen Cannon](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/content/judge-aileen-m-cannon) of the [Southern District of Florida](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/content/fort-pierce), a [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-appointee. [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) appealed [Cannon](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/content/judge-aileen-m-cannon)’s dismissal but dropped the effort after [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s 2024 election win, effectively putting the criminal case to rest.

[Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) also said he expected further attacks from the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), and that he would not be surprised if the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) indicts him.

“I am eyes wide open that this [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) will seek retribution against me if he can,” [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) said. “I know that.”
