## [Argentina recommits to trade with China despite big U.S. bailout](https://www.ms.now/opinion/argentina-china-trade-us-bailout-trump-milei)

*If the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s aid to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s South [America](https://www.usa.gov/)n ally was intended to box out Chinese influence, it didn’t work.*

By [Ja'han Jones](https://www.ms.now/author/jahan-jones)

Despite receiving [billions of American tax dollars](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/price-tag-trumps-argentina-bailout-set-double-creating-democratic-oppo-rcna237989) last year in a controversial bailout backed by [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/)’s [president](https://www.casarosada.gob.ar/) recommitted on Thursday to expanding his country’s trade with [China](https://www.gov.cn/) at the [World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/) in [Davos](https://www.gemeindedavos.ch/), [Switzerland](https://www.admin.ch/gov/).

[Javier Milei](https://www.casarosada.gob.ar/el-presidente/)’s comments arguably kicked sand in the face of [America](https://www.usa.gov/)n farmers [who warned last year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szSr-VhYKWw) that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s bailout of [Argentina](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/) would undercut the U.S. economy because of the nation’s deep trade relationship with [China](https://www.gov.cn/). 

[Bloomberg reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-22/milei-calls-china-a-great-trade-partner-after-meeting-trump?srnd=phx-us-politics&embedded-checkout=true):

> *In an interview with [Bloomberg News](https://www.bloomberg.com/) Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait at the [World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/) on Thursday, [Milei](https://www.casarosada.gob.ar/el-presidente/) deftly balanced his ideological support for [US President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) with his economic courtship of [China](https://www.gov.cn/), while making the case for free trade. ‘The way we see it, [China](https://www.gov.cn/) is a great trading partner,’ [Milei](https://www.casarosada.gob.ar/el-presidente/) said, minutes after appearing at a [Davos](https://www.gemeindedavos.ch/) event with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) as one of the founding members of the [US president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s contentious ‘Board of Peace.’ ‘If you look at [China](https://www.gov.cn/)’s weight in the world, you’ll understand I have to trade with [China](https://www.gov.cn/).’*

When [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) announced the \$20 billion taxpayer-funded bailout last year, he made it clear that its primary purpose was to prop up [Milei](https://www.casarosada.gob.ar/el-presidente/) and his far-right political party. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [said that the money](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/south-america/trump-threatens-pull-support-argentina-politics-move-leftward-rcna237704) was “helping a great philosophy take over a great country” and that he wouldn’t be as generous if [Milei](https://www.casarosada.gob.ar/el-presidente/) lost his re-election bid. At the same time, in an apparent effort to legitimize the bailout, other [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) officials claimed the effort was intended to [counter China’s influence in the country](https://www.ms.now/news/how-20-billion-for-argentina-aligns-with-trumps-national-security-strategy). (Earlier this month, [U.S. Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/) [Secretary Scott Bessent](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/scott-bessent) said, and the [Central Bank of Argentina](https://www.bcra.gob.ar/) corroborated, that [Argentina had fully repaid](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/us-treasury-secretary-argentina-repaid-us-credit-line-129063267) the funds it had drawn from the bailout.)

In response to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s destructive trade war, [China](https://www.gov.cn/) stopped buying U.S. soybeans and [turned to Argentina](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/chinas-2025-soybean-imports-hit-record-fuelled-by-s-american-purchases-2026-01-14/#:~:text=PURCHASES%20OF%20U.S.%20BEANS%20ROSE,shipments%20expected%20in%20coming%20weeks.) instead. That prompted [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to announce a \$12 billion bailout he said would go to [American](https://www.usa.gov/) farmers, paid for by revenue from his [legally questionable tariffs](https://www.ms.now/msnbc/supreme-court-trump-tariffs-case-legal-analysis-rcna241991). (Whether and how much that bailout will actually [benefit farmers is an open question](https://www.wpr.org/news/farmers-billions-bailout-money-offset-losses).) And as the [as the Associated Press noted earlier this week](https://apnews.com/article/trump-china-soybeans-trade-war-tariffs-xi-b973ce99802403b7c1759320c225a524), even though [China](https://www.gov.cn/) has started buying soybeans from U.S. farmers again, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s chaotic imposition of new tariffs has increased uncertainty about whether it will continue. 

So, what can we take from [Milei](https://www.casarosada.gob.ar/el-presidente/)’s comments about his nation’s expanding trade relationship with [China](https://www.gov.cn/)? 

It’s simple, really. The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s ostensible effort to kneecap [China](https://www.gov.cn/) ended up undercutting [America](https://www.usa.gov/)n farmers and the [America](https://www.usa.gov/)n economy more broadly, and the country we bailed out with billions of [American](https://www.usa.gov/) tax dollars responded by committing to increase trade with the U.S.’s largest economic rival.

That move also came within days of [Canada](https://www.canada.ca/), until very recently one of the U.S.’ closest allies, [announcing its new trade deal with China](https://www.ms.now/opinion/trump-manages-to-push-a-top-u-s-ally-to-team-up-with-china). [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s policies are isolating the U.S. economy and sending nations around the world into [China](https://www.gov.cn/)’s embrace — a remarkable display of self-sabotage by the guy who made his [reputation with a book called “The Art of the Deal.”](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-23/why-trump-s-trade-and-greenland-deals-aren-t-always-real-deals?embedded-checkout=true)

The [American](https://www.usa.gov/) public, meanwhile, is taking notice. A [recent Economist/YouGov poll](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2026/01/22/trump-approval-rating-greenland-minnesota-ice/88284703007/) found that 70% of [Americans](https://www.usa.gov/) say the economy is “fair” or “poor” under his leadership, and 71% believe the U.S. under [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is “out of control.”
