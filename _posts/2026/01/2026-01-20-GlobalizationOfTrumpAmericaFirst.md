## [How Trump’s ‘America First’ became a global affair](https://www.ms.now/news/how-trumps-america-first-became-a-global-affair)

*A year into his second term, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)'s foreign entanglements and trade wars have eclipsed the domestic agenda he campaigned on.*

Jan. 18, 2026, 6:00 AM EST
By [Julia Jester](https://www.ms.now/author/julia-jester) and Jake Traylor

Moments after he took the oath of office in the Capitol Rotunda on Jan. 20, 2025, [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) made a promise to Americans.

“We will measure our success not only by the battles we win but also by the wars that we end, and perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into,” he said, vowing to avoid the “catastrophic events abroad” that had consumed his predecessor.

One year later, the United States has carried out nearly 600 military strikes across three continents, according to military watchdog ACLED — more than during [President Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/)’s entire term — while [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has threatened force against allies and adversaries alike and launched a global tariff war that has rattled markets and raised consumer prices. After vowing to end America’s proclivity to police the world, in just one year, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has launched a deadly operation to capture [Venezuelan](https://gob.ve/) [President Nicolas Maduro](https://presidencia.gob.ve/Site/Web/Principal/paginas/classIndex.php); struck 35 vessels in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific, killing 115 alleged drug-smugglers; bombed targets in [Syria](https://egov.sy/), [Yemen](https://www.mofa-ye.org/), [Somalia](https://www.somalia.gov.so/), [Nigeria](https://statehouse.gov.ng/) and [Iran](https://irangov.ir/); and threatened military action against countries including [Colombia](https://www.cancilleria.gov.co/), [Cuba](https://www.presidencia.gob.cu/en/), [Mexico](https://www.gob.nz/) and [Greenland](https://naalakkersuisut.gl/).

While food and housing remain unaffordable for many Americans, military spending continues to balloon — the operation to capture Maduro alone is estimated to have cost \$500 million alone, and the drug boat strikes and military buildup in the Caribbean is in the “|$800 million range,” [according to Democratic leadership of the House and Senate Armed Services committees](https://www.ms.now/news/top-democrats-congress-costs-pentagon-caribbean-venezuela-operations), who said they have yet to receive exact figures from the [Pentagon](https://www.defense.gov/).

It’s not just isolated strikes and targeted operations. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has suggested the U.S. could spend years administering [Venezuela](https://gob.ve/), and has threatened to take over [Greenland](https://naalakkersuisut.gl/) — actions that could cost American taxpayers even more. 

Still, the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) administration and its allies continue to frame his approach as putting America First.

“[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) didn’t campaign on ‘no involvement in foreign affairs,’” said a [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) official granted anonymity to speak candidly. “It was the opposite: He said, for example, that Iran having nuclear weapons was the single greatest threat to the country.” 

Asked why running [Venezuela](https://gob.ve/), a country in South America, is “America First,” [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) told [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/) that “we want to surround ourselves with good neighbors. We want to surround ourselves with stability. We want to surround ourselves with energy. We have tremendous energy in that country. It’s very important that we protect it. We need that for ourselves. We need that for the world.”

The official added: “Presidencies are measured in years. Sentiment goes in waves. I’m very confident that after four years, next to nobody will regret their vote.”

But foreign policy experts question the way the administration has pursued its agenda on the global stage.

“I think it gives the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) way too much credit to suggest that there’s coherence to the set of impulses that he and his cabinet are indulging as they engage the world,” said [Kori Schake](https://www.aei.org/profile/kori-schake/), director of foreign and defense policy studies at the [American Enterprise Institute](https://www.aei.org/), a conservative think tank. “They are overwhelmingly destructive to America’s security and to our prosperity by destroying the alliances, the soft power, the magnetism and the economic dynamism that have made the United States so successful.”

Military action represents only one dimension of the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s international focus. He has exerted massive economic pressure in the form of tariffs, which he has framed as correcting unfair trade relationships, but which economists say have created economic volatility and raised prices for American consumers.

On April 2, which the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) called “Liberation Day,” he announced what he termed “reciprocal” tariffs that established a 10 percent baseline tax on all U.S. imports and sharply higher rates for dozens of nations with trade surpluses. Though global markets have widely recovered from the hit, economic experts conclude that tariffs have caused immense economic volatility, negatively impacted GDP and broadly increased consumer prices. 

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has also leveraged tariffs as a diplomatic weapon, most recently by threatening to impose [10 percent tariffs on eight European nations](https://www.ms.now/news/trump-greenland-tariffs-europe-nato-allies) until a deal is reached for the United States to purchase [Greenland](https://naalakkersuisut.gl/), despite the self-governing territory’s opposition to such an arrangement.

The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has consistently maintained that tariffs, despite short-term disruptions and higher costs for American consumers, will lead to long-term economic prosperity.

Despite the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s argument that its military and economic actions will ultimately make Americans safer and better off, his attention spent abroad comes at the expense of using that political capital to address affordability — and the public’s mood is souring.

An [AP-NORC poll found](https://apnews.com/article/poll-trump-venezuela-foreign-policy-approval-ce8d92a1461abb354f8c799e6b487e49) 56 percent of Americans think [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has overstepped on military interventions abroad, largely driven by [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) and independents.

Although independents are pulling away from the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), especially when it comes to actions abroad, the backlash from his [MAGA](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) base has not yet reached a critical mass. 

[Schake](https://www.aei.org/profile/kori-schake/) says that’s because there hasn’t been any real cost to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s aggressive interventionist approach. 

“There haven’t been any American servicemen and women killed, there haven’t been dramatic consequences,” she told [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/). 

“So he hasn’t really paid a price for anything yet.”
