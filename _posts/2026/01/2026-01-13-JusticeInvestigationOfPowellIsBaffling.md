## [The baffling timing of the DOJ's Jerome Powell investigation](https://www.ms.now/opinion/jerome-powell-investigation-jeanine-pirro)

*The [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/)'s investigation in the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) [Chair](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) is as ham-fisted as it is unprecedented.*

Jan. 13, 2026, 6:00 AM EST
By [Hayes Brown](https://www.ms.now/author/hayes-brown)

The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s legal threat against [Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/prosecutors-open-investigation-into-fed-chair-powell-sparking-immediate-backlash) is as unprecedented as it is ham-fisted. [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) revealed in a video statement Sunday that the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) had opened a criminal investigation into him over the renovations of the [Washington headquarters]() of the independent agency he runs. Although everyone can see through the stated reason for the lawsuit to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s obsession with interest rates — which [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) articulated sharply — it’s startling that the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) is willing to risk colossal damage to the U.S. economy to further [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s agenda. Especially considering it still might not even accomplish the latter.

As a criminal matter, the investigation makes little sense. Federal prosecutors are examining whether [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) lied to [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) about the scope of the project or did not obtain the proper permits to undertake the $2.5 billion renovations, [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/for-years-powell-avoided-fighting-trump-thats-over-27451d32?mod=WSJ_home_mediumtopper_pos_1), reported. The project has run over budget, but [the Fed has been transparent](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/24/business/trump-federal-reserve-renovations-powell.html) about where the additional costs have come from, and which features from an earlier proposal that drew criticism had been nixed. It’s hard to see how benefit [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) could have benefited from this situation.

> **As a criminal matter, the investigation makes little sense.**

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said in [an interview Sunday with NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-denies-involvement-doj-fed-subpoena-jerome-powell-rcna253526) that he’d had no role in the criminal investigation of [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm). “I don’t know anything about it, but he’s certainly not very good at the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/), and he’s not very good at building buildings,” he said.

The [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/)’s involvement makes slightly more sense when the source of the probe is considered. [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/11/us/politics/jerome-powell-fed-inquiry-trump.html) reported that the “inquiry, which includes an analysis of [Mr. Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm)’s public statements and an examination of spending records, was approved in November by [Jeanine Pirro](https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/staff-profile/meet-us-attorney), a longtime ally of [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)” who was appointed [U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia](https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/staff-profile/meet-us-attorney) last year.

[Pirro](https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/staff-profile/meet-us-attorney) is a former [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) host and well-practiced conspiracy theorist. Would she greenlight a political fishing expedition? As [former U.S. attorney Barbara McQuade noted](https://www.ms.now/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jeanine-pirro-fox-news-trump-prosecutor-dc-weapon-rcna215526) noted last year, [Pirro](https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/staff-profile/meet-us-attorney) “has plenty of what [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) seems to prize most — loyalty.” McQuade also warned: “[Pirro](https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/staff-profile/meet-us-attorney)’s history as a strident [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) booster would absolutely and obviously undermine public confidence in the soundness of her discretionary decision-making in the high-profile cases that are likely to come across her desk.”

But in escalating this matter to the point that the normally staid [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) was motivated to respond with a defiant public statement, [Pirro](https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/staff-profile/meet-us-attorney)’s office has already made a mess of its hatchet job. Until lawyers formally try to obtain an indictment, this matter is going to linger in a way that lessens the pressure on [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm). So far, [Sens.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Thom Tillis (T-NC)](https://www.tillis.senate.gov/), [Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)](https://www.warren.senate.gov/) and [Lisa Murkowski (T-AK)](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/) have all said they [won’t vote for any Federal Reserve nominees](https://x.com/lisamurkowski/status/2010743755603948017), including a next chair, until the investigation against [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) has ended.

But the timing of the investigation remains baffling. For one thing, [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm)’s four-year term as [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) [chair](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) is due to end in May; after months of insults and criticisms of [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) by the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), there’s no chance that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), who first appointed [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) in 2017, does so again. When [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm)’s term expires, he’ll still have two years left in his time as a member of the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/)’s [Board of Governors](https://www.federalreserve.gov/). Before last week, it seemed most likely [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) would [followed past precedent](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fed-faces-turbulent-2026-powells-term-ends-independence-tested-2025-12-09/) and resigned from the board entirely. That’s less certain now, as doing so would leave another seat open for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to fill.

[Pirro](https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/staff-profile/meet-us-attorney)’s office has already made a mess of its hatchet job.

Bear in mind, too, that the [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) is set to hear arguments in [the case of Lisa Cook](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-lisa-cook-federal-reserve-board-trump-rcna232182), a member of the [Board of Governors](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) whom [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) attempted to fire last year. [Fed governors](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) are meant to be insulated from political whims and, as [my colleague Jordan Rubin](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/powell-doj-probe-supreme-court-federal-reserve-lisa-cook) has noted, the justices, noting the historical independence of the agency, have allowed [Cook](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/cook.htm) to keep her seat as they consider her case. The intensified spotlight on the pressure campaign against [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) could make the [justices](https://www.justice.gov/) less partial to arguments to end the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/)’s independence, including [presidential](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) attempts to fire the [chairman](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) outright.

The [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) also served grand jury subpoenas about two weeks before the [the next Federal Open Market Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm) meeting on interest rates. [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) played a key role in getting the committee to cut rates three times last year, but Wall Street analysts have suggested the investigation is a detriment to further reductions. As [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/trump-powell-fed-dollar-interest-rates-rcna253536), [JPMorgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/global) analysts “now expect the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) to stay on hold throughout 2026.” In other words, the exact opposite of what [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has been hoping to accomplish by bullying [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) for the past year.

Importantly, this case is still in early stages. The [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) [managed to fail to obtain grand jury indictments](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/letitia-james-trump-doj-no-indictment) in several high-profile cases against other [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) political enemies. It’s entirely possible that the case against [Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) fizzles out without any charges ever being filed.

In meddling with [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) operations, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) prosecutors have rattled Wall Street and [prompted bipartisan backlash](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/01/12/congress/gop-angst-grows-powell-investigation-00721939) from the Hill. And even if they succeed in indicting the head of U.S. monetary policy — still a big if — they risk sparking a global economic crisis over fears of a fully [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-controlled [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) and economy. It’s a lose-lose situation for the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/), one that ends with a chastened retreat or a serious blow to America’s monetary health.
