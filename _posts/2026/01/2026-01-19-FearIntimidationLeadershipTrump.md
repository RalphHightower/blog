## [Republicans admit Trump’s grip on the congressional GOP is as tight as ever](https://www.ms.now/news/republicans-trump-grip-congressional-gop)

*“This is still the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s party — he has ultimate control, in my opinion, of what goes and what doesn’t go,” said [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Max Miller (T-OH7)](https://maxmiller.house.gov/).*

Jan. 19, 2026, 5:00 AM EST
By Mychael Schnell and Kevin Frey

While [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s occasional [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) detractors in [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) continue to grab headlines — on [Venezuela](https://www.ms.now/news/republicans-reverse-war-powers-vote-trump-unchecked-authority-venezuela), [Greenland](https://www.ms.now/news/weapons-grade-stupid-trump-greenland-threats-seriously-not-literally), [health care](https://www.ms.now/news/house-gop-rebels-obamacare-subsidy-breakthrough), and even issues like [Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.ms.now/news/senate-passes-epstein-bill-rcna244723) — the reality on Capitol Hill remains the same as it’s been for the last year: The overwhelming majority of [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) are in lockstep with the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).

Throughout the first year of his second term, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s grip on the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) has occasionally appeared tenuous. A small faction of [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) break with the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) from time to time, sometimes loudly.

But more often than not, even on issues where the American public is against [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), most [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) are standing firm with the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). 

They follow [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) when he tells them how to vote on his legislative priorities, as he did with the [reconciliation bill](https://www.ms.now/top-stories/latest/trump-big-beautiful-megabill-republicans-july-fourth-rcna216961) and [unpopular spending rescissions](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5347453-house-gop-doge-cuts/). They refuse to call him out when he says [obviously incorrect](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-claims/) or [offensive things](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/29/donald-trump-racism-dei-misogyny-2025-review). And they tolerate the [the president seizing power](https://www.ms.now/news/this-is-a-war-some-republicans-trump-venezuela) from [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/), even as many of these same lawmakers [once called out Democrats](https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/ej-montini/2025/07/31/king-obama-executive-orders-donald-trump/85455907007/?gnt-cfr=1&gca-cat=pp&gca-ds=override) for doing exactly that.

Thus far, that’s the real lesson of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s second term — that [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s are standing by him, through thick and thin, even when his actions make many lawmakers uneasy.

Perhaps no episode captures [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s power over the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) better than [Venezuela](https://gob.ve/).

Days after the surprise attack and unauthorized capture of Nicolás Maduro, five [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s broke ranks and voted with [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) to advance a war powers resolution that would have reined in the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s unchecked military powers.

But the insurgency was short-lived.

A week later, following an intense lobbying campaign from [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), two of the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) defectors — [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Todd Young (T-IN)](https://www.young.senate.gov/) and [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Josh Hawley (T-MO)](https://www.hawley.senate.gov/) — reversed course. They flipped their votes to kill the resolution after they got bare minimum commitments from the administration to consult [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) before putting boots on the ground again in [Venezuela](https://gob.ve/).

Rather than serving as a check on the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), the ordeal illustrated that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) can carry out a major military strike, without congressional approval or advance notice, and [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) will ultimately jump to his defense.

Of course, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has his detractors. 

[Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Thomas Massie (T-KY4)](https://massie.house.gov/), has emerged as a consistent critic of the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s freewheeling foreign policy and his attempts to block the release of Epstein files. [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Lisa Murkowski (T-AK)](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/), has again brought her independent streak to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s second term. [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Thom Tillis (T-NC)](https://www.tillis.senate.gov/), has shown less patience for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s more outlandish statements since announcing his retirement. The same is true of [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Don Bacon (T-NE2)](https://bacon.house.gov/) And a rotating group of vulnerable House [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) has drawn contrasts with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to prove independence to swing-district voters.

All of those [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) have unique and convincing explanations as to why it seems [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) lawmakers are increasingly breaking with the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).

Asked to describe [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s relationship with congressional [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/), [Massie](https://massie.house.gov/) summed it up in one word: “Abusive.”

“In his first presidency, a lot of [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s were endeared to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and compelled to support him because we shared a goal,” [Massie](https://massie.house.gov/) told [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/). “And just a year into this, I think a lot of [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s are biting their tongue and doing things they’d rather not because they’re afraid of [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).”

[Bacon](https://bacon.house.gov/) said the idea that [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s are breaking from [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) stems from the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s many controversies — from [Greenland](https://www.ms.now/news/weapons-grade-stupid-trump-greenland-threats-seriously-not-literally) to the [Justice Department’s investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell](https://www.ms.now/news/trump-powell-republicans-congress-red-line) — becoming “a bridge too far for a lot of folks.”

But he also noted that most congressional [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s are sticking with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) because “people don’t want to get on the bad side.”

Many [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) privately concede that’s true, and many stay quiet when they disagree with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). But there are also those vulnerable [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) trying to make their opposition very clear to independent voters — while also not provoking the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) or alienating [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) voters.

Not that [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s want to acknowledge that dynamic publicly. 

[Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Brian Fitzpatrick (T-PA1)](https://fitzpatrick.house.gov/), one of the most moderate [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s in [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/), said colleagues who break with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) are simply “representing their districts.”

The closest [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/) got to an admission that vulnerable [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s strategically manage their [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) opposition was [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Jeff Van Drew (T-NJ2)](https://vandrew.house.gov/) saying other [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) lawmakers in his position are “on the edge.”

“They won by tiny, tiny amounts,” he said.

And yet, when the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) needs votes — whether from the [Freedom Caucus on reconciliation](https://www.notus.org/donald-trump/reconciliation-passes) or from supposed moderates on [rescissions](https://www.notus.org/congress/house-narrowly-passes-rescission-bill-moderate-concerns) — he’s usually able to get them.

Take the [House](https://www.house.gov/) [rescissions vote](https://www.notus.org/congress/house-narrowly-passes-rescission-bill-moderate-concerns). Two vulnerable [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s — [Reps.](https://www.house.gov/) [Mike Lawler (T-NY17)](https://lawler.house.gov/) and [Young Kim (T-CA40)](https://youngkim.house.gov/) — initially [held back their support](https://www.notus.org/congress/house-narrowly-passes-rescission-bill-moderate-concerns) for the bill codifying \$9.4 billion in [Department of Government Efficiency](https://doge.gov/) cuts to international aid and public broadcasting. Once it became clear their votes were needed, they both voted for the legislation.

To an extent, the seeming [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) opposition in [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) is a fig leaf for independence. The reality, [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) lawmakers told [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/), is that most [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s stand firmly with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).

“This is still the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s party — he has ultimate control, in my opinion, of what goes and what doesn’t go,” said [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Max Miller (T-OH7)](https://maxmiller.house.gov/), who worked in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) during [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s first term. “He’s done a great job with the influence that he’s had over the conference and the [Republican Party](https://www.gop.com/), and very much, I believe, the [Republican Party](https://www.gop.com/) is still the party of [Donald J. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).”

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) agrees — and he recently acknowledged that he’s had little problem convincing [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) holdouts to give him his votes.

“Usually, almost always, they’d give it,” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said during a speech at the House [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) policy retreat earlier this month. “But they wanted to be called.”

In interviews with more than a dozen congressional [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s, [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) lawmakers argued that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s relationship with them remains strong.

“It’s great,” [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Rick Scott (T-FL)](7), said. “He’s accessible, he listens, and he’s got unbelievable energy. He’s like the energizer bunny.”

[Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Warren Davidson (T-OH8)](https://davidson.house.gov/), acknowledged that “there are people that will be anxious at certain times.”

“But so far, he’s turning out roses everywhere you turn,” [Davidson](https://davidson.house.gov/) said.

And in the words of [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Mike Rounds (T-SD)](https://www.rounds.senate.gov/), “It has been a phenomenal, successful year,” crediting the “coordinated effort between the administration and [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s in the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) and in the [House](https://www.house.gov/).”

Still, some [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) sought to downplay [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s grip over the congressional [GOP](https://www.gop.com/).

“We have a good, collaborative relationship, but nothing is in lockstep,” [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Scott Perry (T-PA10)](https://perry.house.gov/), said. “He’s got some ideas, we like some of them, some we like a little less, same thing for him with us, and that’s why we work stuff out.”

That is sometimes true. But again and again, [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s have shown a willingness to do the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s bidding.

Case in point: [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) approved two bills unanimously last month — one that supported a clean water project pipeline in [Colorado](https://www.colorado.gov/), and one that would widen land for the [Miccosukee Tribe of Indians](https://miccosukee.com/) in [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/). [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), however, vetoed the bills — a seemingly strange move when there was clearly enough support to override his vetoes.

And yet, more than 175 [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s ended up [flipping their votes](https://www.ms.now/news/house-refuses-to-override-trump-vetoes-including-colorado-water-project) in the [House](https://www.house.gov/) to sustain both vetoes.

Still, [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) continue to focus on the instances when [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) break from [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), noting that while the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) enjoys overwhelming support, his [flagging poll numbers](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-approval-rating-sinks-lower-republicans-decision-make-rcna241791) do seem to be having an effect on his support within the congressional [GOP](https://www.gop.com/).

“I think they appreciate that he’s becoming less and less popular every day,” [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Greg Landsman, D-OH1)](https://landsman.house.gov/), told [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/). “He’s probably below water in their districts.”

[Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-NY14)](https://ocasio-cortez.house.gov/), also noted that more [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s seem to be breaking with [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) on some issues — like the Epstein files and a recent vote on extending Obamacare subsidies.

“Do I think everyone’s doing this out of the goodness of their own heart? Probably not,” [Ocasio-Cortez](https://ocasio-cortez.house.gov/) said. “But I do think that people are reading the writing on the wall.”

But [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s dismissed the blips as run-of-the-mill disagreements.

“The only politician that I’ve agreed with on absolutely everything is me,” said longtime [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Tom McClintock (T-CA5)](https://mcclintock.house.gov/). “Everybody else in the world is a disappointment and a compromise.”

“There are gonna be differences of opinions on a wide variety of issues, but you take policy in its totality,” he added. “And I would say that I have never seen a stronger relationship between a [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) conference and a [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).”

As [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Byron Donalds (T-FL19)](https://donalds.house.gov/) told [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/): “If everybody agreed every time, this would be boring.”
