*On the anniversary of the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s second inaugural, the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) picked an unfortunate time to boast about stock market growth.*

In recognition of the first anniversary of [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s second inaugural, the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [released a list](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2026/01/365-wins-in-365-days-president-trumps-return-marks-new-era-of-success-prosperity/) of “365 wins” from the past year. One of the entries gave the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) credit for delivering “a historic stock-market rebound, with the major stock indices all hitting repeated new record highs.”

It was a flawed boast for a variety of reasons. For one thing, while the major indexes improved in 2025, nothing about the results was “historic.” For another, given that the U.S. stock market had a very good year in 2024, characterizing that growth as a “rebound” didn’t make sense, either. (Also left unsaid is the fact that several major economies internationally [fared better than the United States](https://www.thebulwark.com/p/trump-says-we-have-the-hottest-economy-markets-tell-different-story) on stock market growth.)

But perhaps most notable of all was the problem the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) didn’t see coming: the bad timing of the boast. [The New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/business/stocks-trump-greenland-tariffs.html):

> *[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s intensifying standoff with European leaders over the fate of [Greenland](https://naalakkersuisut.gl/) prompted a sharp response from investors Tuesday, with the value of U.S. stocks, the dollar and government bonds all falling.*

The [S&P 500](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ESPX/) dropped over 2 percent for the first time since October, as investors reacted to [Mr. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s increasing threat of higher tariffs on European allies unless they supported his plans for America to take control of [Greenland](https://naalakkersuisut.gl/).

It’s worth emphasizing that the [Vix index](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EVIX/) — sometimes referred to in financial circles as the “panic index” — jumped, reaching levels unseen in months.

As an [NBC News report](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/stock-market-trump-tariffs-greenland-rcna254918), assessing the overall losses, noted, “The [S&P 500](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ESPX/) ended lower by around 2.1%, while the [Nasdaq Composite](https://indexes.nasdaqomx.com/Index/Overview/COMP) plunged more than 2.4%. The [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EDJI/) dropped around 870 points. The [S&P 500](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ESPX/)’s losses Tuesday erased the index’s gains for the year so far. The [Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/) is now down more than 1% in 2026.”

The same report added that the sell-off “amounted to more than \$1 trillion in value wiped out from the [S&P 500](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ESPX/).”

Happy Anniversary, [Mr. President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).

If recent history is any guide, the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) will suggest the downturn is unrelated to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), his radical [Greenland](https://naalakkersuisut.gl/) crusade or to the tariffs that risk a trade war with U.S. partners in Europe.

But there’s no great mystery as to what drove Tuesday’s events on Wall Street. “This is ‘sell America’ again within a much broader global risk,” [Krishna Guha](https://www.evercore.com/team/krishna-guha/), head of global policy and central banking strategy at [Evercore ISI](https://www.evercore.com/our-business-and-capabilities/equities/research/), [wrote in a message to clients](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/20/sell-america-trade-dollar-treasury-gold-us-trump-greenland.html).
