## [Trump muses about canceling the 2026 midterm elections, before saying he won’t](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-midterm-elections-cancelling-2026)

*Given his record, when the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) mentions canceling elections, it’s difficult simply to shrug one’s shoulders.*

Jan. 7, 2026, 10:53 AM EST

[Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Chris Murphy (D-CT)](https://www.murphy.senate.gov/) has expressed more concern than most [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) officials about [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s potential plans for the 2026 midterm elections. Last May, for example, pointing to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s hostility toward democracy, the senator [told MS NOW’s Nicolle Wallace](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3lp3gyiltzc2o), “There’s no guarantee that we are going to have a free and fair election in 2026.”


A month later, [Murphy](https://www.murphy.senate.gov/) [made related comments](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3lqt6abivw42h), telling MS NOW’s Jen Psaki, “We can’t be preparing for the 2026 election. It might not come.”

The comments came to mind watching [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) address the [House Republican Conference](https://www.gop.gov/) at the [Kennedy Center](https://www.kennedycenter.org/). [Time magazine reported](https://time.com/7343696/trump-floats-cancelling-2026-elections/):

> *[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) on Tuesday floated the idea of canceling future U.S. elections, elevating a longstanding concern among critics of how he might try to limit threats to his power in his second term.*

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) brought up the idea while speaking to [House Republicans](https://www.gop.gov/) at their annual retreat, and then quickly insisted he was not calling for such a move, casting his remarks as a critique of [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) rather than a proposal.

In context, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) was rambling about his contempt for [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/), which led to related electoral thoughts.

“How we have to run against these people,” [Trump said incredulously](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-speech-gop-house-member-retreat-january-6-2026/), as if [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) were unworthy opponents. “I won’t say, ‘Cancel the election, they should cancel the election,’ because the fake news will say, ‘He wants the elections canceled. He’s a dictator.’”

In isolation, comments like these might seem easy to overlook, were it not for the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)’s larger record.

In August, for example, during a meeting with [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://www.president.gov.ua/) — whose country cannot hold elections during [Russia](http://government.ru/)’s deadly war — [Trump said](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-postpone-2028-election-zelenskyy-joke-dictator-rcna225893), “Say, 3 1/2 years from now, so you mean, if we happen to be in a war with somebody, no more elections.”

This is the same American [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) who has repeatedly talked about [ignoring the U.S. Constitution and seeking a third term](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/constitution-trump-says-s-not-joking-eyeing-third-term-rcna198827). [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has similarly discussed [“terminating” parts of the Constitution](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/fire-trump-denies-writing-wrote-constitution-rcna60282) that stand in the way of his ambitions and [creating a temporary American “dictatorship.”](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/poll-republican-voters-are-board-trumps-dictator-talk-rcna137917)

What’s more, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s comments at the [Kennedy Center](https://www.kennedycenter.org/) came on the fifth anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack — political violence [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) instigated as part of [an effort to overturn the results of an election he lost](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jan-6-whodunit-committee-finds-one-man-responsible-rcna63075) and to remain in office despite the will of American voters.

So when [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) starts musing about canceling elections, it’s difficult simply to shrug one’s shoulders and laugh it off as meaningless nonsense.
