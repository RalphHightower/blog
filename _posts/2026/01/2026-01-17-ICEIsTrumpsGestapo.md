## [ICE is behaving like Trump’s secret police force. It will get worse.](https://www.ms.now/opinion/trump-ice-agents-shooting-minnesota-secret-police)

*The [agency](https://www.ice.gov/) is shunning norms of law enforcement and becoming a militarized wing of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s political agenda — and it's going to get worse.*

Jan. 17, 2026, 6:00 AM EST
By [Zeeshan Aleem](https://www.ms.now/author/zeeshan-aleem)

The federal government’s aggressive immigration enforcement operation in [Minneapolis](https://www.minneapolismn.gov/) is looking more and more like [a siege on a city](https://www.ms.now/opinion/minneapolis-renee-good-george-floyd-ice-immigration-minnesota) than an effort to enforce the law there.

Masked [Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents](https://www.ice.gov/) are using [extraordinary violence](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/13/us/ice-videos-minnesota-trump-immigration.html) to detain residents. They are [pepper-spraying and smashing the car windows](https://apnews.com/article/immigration-protest-arrests-detention-ice-8993bfd5d54b870521ec5b44fc42cd71) of observers and activists, and [tear-gassing street intersections](https://x.com/FordFischer/status/2010827267950182458). They are [patrolling streets](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/13/us/ice-videos-minnesota-trump-immigration.html) with rifles. Schools [have shuttered](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2026/01/08/after-border-patrol-clash-at-roosevelt-minneapolis-schools-cancel-classes) because of safety concerns. And after an ICE agent shot and killed 37-year-old mother [Renee Good](https://www.ms.now/news/minneapolis-woman-killed-by-ice-agent-was-a-mother-a-poet-and-a-wife), tensions with residents have only increased. “This is a military occupation, and it feels like a military occupation,” [Elliott Payne](https://www.minneapolismn.gov/government/city-council/members/ward-1/), the president of the [Minneapolis](https://www.minneapolismn.gov/) [City Council](https://www.minneapolismn.gov/government/city-council/), [told The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/13/us/ice-videos-minnesota-trump-immigration.html). There’s video footage showing [Payne](https://www.minneapolismn.gov/government/city-council/members/ward-1/) [being shoved by an apparent agent](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2222105994983432) while observing [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) behavior.

Despite [lawsuits from Minnesota](https://www.minneapolismn.gov/news/2026/january/ag-lawsuit/) and objections [from civil liberties groups](https://www.aclu-mn.org/press-releases/mn-ice-shooting/) and local residents, the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has [consistently denied](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-dhs-ice-secret-police-civil-rights-unaccountable) that [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) is behaving inappropriately and has defended its repressive tactics — including killing Good, whom it preposterously labeled a “[domestic terrorist](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/12/us/politics/fbi-renee-good-ice-shooting.html).”

> **The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is encouraging [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) officers to view themselves as beholden to the standards of the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) rather than the law.**

Something sinister is emerging. [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) isn’t behaving like a normal arm of federal law enforcement. Instead, it’s increasingly acting like a secret police force or paramilitary on behalf of [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) as it uses surveillance and violence to enact a political agenda of domination. Unfortunately, there are reasons to believe things will only get worse. 

First, there is a trend toward the deprofessionalization of [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) agents during [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s second term. [The Atlantic reported in August](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/08/ice-recruitment-immigration-enforcement-billions/684000/) that “new deportation officers at [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) used to receive about five months of federal-law-enforcement training. [Administration officials](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) have cut that time roughly in half, partly by eliminating Spanish-language courses.” The magazine added that according to three officials, the academy training was shortened to 47 days because [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is the [47th president](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). 

Juliette Kayyem, an assistant secretary for intergovernmental affairs at the [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/) during the [Obama administration](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov), [told NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/01/09/nx-s1-5671120/homeland-security-expert-talks-about-ices-truncated-training-after-hiring-blitz): “You’re starting from a pool of people who are not getting the training, don’t have the time to have judgment, who are being launched in missions that are hard to describe, with a political overlay.” 

Journalist Laura Jedeed applied for a job with [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) in order to assess its hiring process, and [described surprise](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2026/01/ice-recruitment-minneapolis-shooting.html) at how easy it was to get in — she said she was given a job after a six-minute interview and despite not filling out a background check form. “[ICE](https://www.ice.gov/)’s recruitment push is so sloppy that the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) effectively has no idea who’s joining the agency’s ranks,” Jedeed wrote in [Slate](https://www.slate.com/). “We’re all, collectively, in the dark about whom the state is arming, tasking with the most sensitive of law enforcement work, and then sending into America’s streets.”

([DHS](https://www.dhs.gov/) [posted on X](https://x.com/DHSgov/status/2011479124502528156) that Jedeed was “NEVER offered a job at [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/)” and said that she had gotten a “tentative selection letter” instead of a final one. A [Slate spokesperson told The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/14/slate-reporter-ice-job-offer) that [Slate](https://www.slate.com/) stands by its reporting and that it had evidence Jedeed was given a final offer letter and a start date.)

Moreover, [DHS](https://www.dhs.gov/) has [gutted most of the office](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-dhs-ice-secret-police-civil-rights-unaccountable) tasked with addressing civil rights complaints, monitoring  [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) agents’ behavior, and keeping them in compliance with the law.

Put the reduction in training, the apparent poor screening, and the decreased oversight together, and you get what appears to be a more ragtag force that’s less likely to comply with policing protocols and the law and more likely to improvise based on instinct and fear. Indeed, there is evidence that [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) agents are consistently disregarding the most basic practices of policing and are [using banned chokeholds](https://www.propublica.org/article/videos-ice-dhs-immigration-agents-using-chokeholds-citizens) and [recklessly boxing in vehicles](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/videos-show-how-ice-vehicle-stops-can-escalate-to-shootings-caf17601), among other things.

Second, as the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is deprofessionalizing [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/), it’s also politicizing the agency. 

[DHS](https://www.dhs.gov/) uses [social media](https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1956077756854186191) to present [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) as a flashy, stereotypically masculine force that personally serves [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).

The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) also constantly [pushes out white nationalist propaganda](https://www.vox.com/politics/475199/ice-shooting-renee-good-trump-white-nationalist-memes-dhs-dol) in its communications with the public, implying that [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) agents are at the forefront of an operation to reshape American culture. A few days after an [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) agent killed Good, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Department of Labor](https://www.dol.gov/) [posted on X](https://x.com/USDOL/status/2010141673389769214), “One Homeland. One People. One Heritage. Remember who you are, American.” [Christopher Hayes](https://smlr.rutgers.edu/faculty-staff/christopher-hayes), a labor historian and professor at [Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/), [told the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/14/union-leaders-trump-administration-white-supremacy) that the post’s [similarity to a Nazi slogan](https://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/29118) was “bad” and expressed concern over “the motivation behind it, the message, the sentiment and desired outcome.” ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/) reported that The [Department of Labor](https://www.dol.gov/) did not comment on the agency’s specific rhetoric on social media, but a spokesperson said, “The social media campaign was created to celebrate American workers and the American Dream.”) And [DHS](https://www.dhs.gov/) has used social media to share [paintings tied to the theme of “manifest destiny,”](https://www.ms.now/opinion/msnbc-opinion/department-homeland-security-painting-american-progress-gast-rcna221128) encouraging Americans to celebrate the country’s history of ethnic cleansing and racial domination. The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has also posted images and videos mocking [chained](https://www.ms.now/top-stories/latest/trump-white-house-mocks-immigrants-deported-asmr-x-elon-musk-rcna192820) and [crying immigrants](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/18/nx-s1-5482921/memes-white-house-dhs-social-media-trump) who have been detained.

The [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) [reports](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2025/ice-social-media-blitz/) that during [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s second term, [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/)’s public affairs arm “has rapidly transformed into an influencer-style media machine” that has tried to glamorize the detainment of immigrants through extensive video footage of raids. It even shared apparently exclusive footage with [Charlie Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/), and other right-wing media figures, for a boost. David Lapan, a [DHS](https://www.dhs.gov/) press secretary during [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s first term (and now a critic of the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s), told the [Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/), “We were supposed to present the facts, not hype things up. But this veers into propaganda, into creating fear.”

[ICE](https://www.ice.gov/)’s ranks [more than doubled](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2026/01/ice-recruitment-minneapolis-shooting.html) in 2025 alone, so a majority of its forces came on during an [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) that wants officers to see their jobs through an overtly political, militarized lens.

Third, the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) also appears to be giving [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) officers carte blanche to use force and protecting it from legal accountability. After Good was killed, the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) swiftly sided with the [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) officer who pulled the trigger, deeming Good a “terrorist,” and blocking [Minnesota](https://www.mn.gov/) officials from investigating the shooting, [claiming they couldn’t be trusted](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/10/us/politics/trump-ice-shooting-response-minneapolis.html). Instead, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s politicized [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) will now be handling the matter. 

The message is clear: The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is encouraging [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) officers to view themselves as beholden to the standards of the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) rather than the law. 

Compounding this impunity is a culture of mask-wearing among [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) agents, which makes it far harder for citizens to hold them accountable for misconduct, or even understand what they are doing. Complaints from the public have [spurred lawmakers in Minnesota](https://web.archive.org/web/20260114191026/https://www.startribune.com/ice-mask-ban-minnesota-st-paul/601560198) to work on legislation banning law enforcement from wearing masks in the state, although they do not expected federal agents to comply with the state law.

[ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) is transforming before our eyes into a secret police force. Its officers largely operate with their faces covered, making it impossible for the public to link individual officers with specific acts of abuse. The agency’s work is increasingly political and unprofessional, and the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) encourages it to see the law as an inconvenience instead of a hard line. One wonders how far [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) will allow [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) to go in its ostensible mission of enhancing immigration enforcement. But it’s already clear that it has no problem with creating a shadowy security force that does the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s bidding, to the great harm of the American public.
