## [Sen. Mark Kelly sues Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth](https://www.ms.now/news/sen-mark-kelly-d-ariz-sues-defense-secretary-pete-hegseth)

*[Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/), a retired [astronaut](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/kelly_mark.pdf?emrc=a62224) and [Navy captain](https://www.navy.mil/), filed the lawsuit in federal court in [Washington, D.C.](https://dc.gov/), after [Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) began retaliatory proceedings to slash his retirement rank and military pension.*

Jan. 12, 2026, 5:46 PM EST
By [Sydney Carruth](https://www.ms.now/author/sydney-carruth)

[Arizona](https://www.az.gov/) [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Mark Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/), a retired [Navy captain](https://www.navy.mil/), filed a [lawsuit](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.288365/gov.uscourts.dcd.288365.1.0.pdf) against [Defense](https://www.defense.gov/) [Secretary Pete Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) on Monday after [Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) launched a process to demote [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/)’s retirement rank and slash his military pension.

The lawsuit, filed in [U.S. District Court](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/) in [Washington, D.C.](https://dc.gov/), named [Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) in his official capacity as secretary of defense. It comes on the heels of months of jousting between [Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) and [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/) over the senator’s participation in a [video](https://x.com/SenatorSlotkin/status/1990774492356902948) reminding service members that they must not follow orders that are illegal under the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/).

The suit alleges [Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/)’s actions violate [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/)’s [First Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/) rights and the [Speech and Debate Clause](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S6-C1-3-1/ALDE_00013300/) of the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/), which protects lawmakers from prosecution for official acts.

The filing asks the federal court to block the [Pentagon](https://www.defense.gov/)’s effort to censure and demote [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/), calling it “unlawful and unconstitutional.”

[Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) announced late last week that the [Pentagon](https://www.defense.gov/) had begun a rarely used process to demote [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/) and cut his military retirement pay as punishment for his participation in the video with five other [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) lawmakers.

The video, released in November, drew swift condemnation from [Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) and [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). In a [Truth Social](https://truthsocial.com/) post, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) accused [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/) and the other [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) who appeared in the video of engaging in “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH.”

[Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/) spoke about the lawsuit Monday afternoon on the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) floor. “If [Pete Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) succeeds in silencing me, then he and every other [Secretary of Defense](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) who comes after him will have license to punish any retired veteran of any political persuasion for the things that they say,” he said. “And by that logic, a 100 year old World War Two Veteran could be hauled in and censured or court martialed because he says something that [Pete Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) disagrees with.”

The [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) lawmakers in the video — [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Elissa Slotkin (D-MI)](https://www.slotkin.senate.gov/) and [Reps.](https://www.house.gov/) [Jason Crow (D-CO7)](https://crow.house.gov/), [Chris Deluzio (D-PA17)](https://deluzio.house.gov/), [Maggie Goodlander (D-NH2)](https://goodlander.house.gov/) and [Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA6)](https://houlahan.house.gov/) — are all retired military or intelligence service members.

The lawsuit argues the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) responded to [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/)’s political speech in the video with “extreme rhetoric and punitive retribution,” by publicly accusing [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/) of “sedition and treason.”

In November the [Pentagon](https://www.defense.gov/) [announced](https://x.com/DeptofWar/status/1992999267967905905) that it was conducting a review of misconduct allegations against [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/) stemming from the video, which would determine whether [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/) should be recalled to active duty status to face court-martial proceedings.

The action is usually reserved for scrutinizing the conduct of active-duty military members. But [Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) last week formally censured [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/) and [announced](https://x.com/SecWar/status/2008189258528665898) that the [Defense Department](https://www.defense.gov/) had “initiated retirement grade determination proceedings” in conjunction with “reduction in retired pay.”

“Before that proceeding even began, the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) publicly accused [Senator](https://www.senate.gov/) [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/) of sedition and treason and demanded punishment,” the lawsuit says. It argues that the public conclusion made about [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/) by the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) before a formal investigation violated his right to due process.

[Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/), a [former astronaut](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/kelly_mark.pdf?emrc=a62224) who retired from the [Navy](https://www.navy.mil/) in 2011 as a captain after 25 years of service, condemned [Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/)’s censure last week as “un-American.”

“He is censuring me because I’ve raised concerns about his actions and military operations,” [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/), who sits on the [Senate Armed Services Committee](http://www.armed-services.senate.gov/), said Monday. “Well, that’s my job. I have every right to say these things as an American, as a retired service member and as a U.S. senator, and especially as a member of the [Armed Services Committee](http://www.armed-services.senate.gov/), whose duty it is to provide oversight over the [Department of Defense](https://www.defense.gov/).”
