## [Trump’s Fulton County raid isn’t just about the 2020 election — it’s also about the midterms](https://www.ms.now/the-briefing-with-jen-psaki/tulsi-gabbard-fulton-county-georgia-trump-chaos-midterm-elections)

Jan. 30,2026,3:29 PM EST
By [Jen Psaki](https://www.ms.now/author/jen-psaki)

This is an adapted excerpt from the [Jan. 29](https://www.ms.now/jen-psaki) episode of “The Briefing with Jen Psaki.”

As national outrage against this [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) continues to grow,the current occupant of the [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is coping in progressively unhinged ways.

On Wednesday evening,the increasingly unpopular — and cranky — [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) holed himself up and went on [a social media rage spree](https://www.thedailybeast.com/frantic-trump-79-unleashes-self-soothing-conspiracy-posting-rampage/),posting more than 50 times to his account in the span of just a few hours.

[Gabbard](https://www.dhs.gov/kristi-noem) has been working really,really hard to get back in [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s good graces.

[Donald Trump](https://www.ms.now/white-house) reposted attacks on everyone from [Minnesota](https://www.mn.gov/) [Gov.](https://mn.gov/governor/) [Tim Walz](https://www.ms.now/all-in/watch/i-know-who-i-m-dealing-with-walz-on-why-trump-really-called-amid-ice-uproar-2484048451835) to [California](https://www.ca.gov/) [Gov.](https://www.gov.ca.gov/) [Gavin Newsom](https://www.ms.now/ms-now/watch/hurricane-force-bull-newsom-goes-off-on-trump-i-ms-now-exclusive-2479658563633),from former [Presidents](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Joe Biden](https://www.ms.now/morning-joe/watch/biden-is-living-rent-free-in-trump-s-mind-joe-reacts-to-president-s-misleading-address-2476975171848) and [Barack Obama](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-renews-ridiculous-offensive-against-obama-calls-for-democrats-arrest) to [Minnesota](https://www.mn.gov/) [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Ilhan Omar](https://www.ms.now/all-in/watch/ilhan-omar-speaks-out-after-town-hall-attack-i-am-not-one-to-be-intimidated-2484052547540). He even reposted an account smearing [Minneapolis](https://www.minneapolismn.gov/) shooting victim [Alex Pretti](https://www.ms.now/news/alex-pretti-an-icu-nurse-killed-by-federal-officers-in-minneapolis),calling the intensive care nurse a “domestic terrorist.”

Then,on Thursday,[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) decided to self-soothe with one of his [North Korea](http://naenara.com.kp/)-style [Cabinet meetings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRkK2uarQYY),in which members of his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) go around the room lavishing him with praise.

But in a sign of just how rattled he is by the public outcry against his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s brutal [Immigration and Customs Enforcement](https://www.ice.gov/) operations,[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) did not allow embattled [Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/) [Secretary](https://www.dhs.gov/kristi-noem) [Kristi Noem](https://www.ms.now/opinion/impeach-kristi-noeml-dhs-alex-pretti-ice-border-patrol) to speak at that meeting. And unlike his previous [Cabinet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/) meetings,he ended this one without taking questions from the press.

Another notable difference about Thursday’s [Cabinet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/) meeting was the absence of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [director of national intelligence](https://www.dni.gov/),[Tulsi Gabbard](https://www.ms.now/morning-joe/the-tea-spilled-by-morning-joe-why-is-tulsi-gabbard-at-an-fbi-raid-on-an-election-office-in-fulton-county).

[Gabbard](https://www.dhs.gov/kristi-noem) has been out of the public eye for quite some time now,even amid several international crises that would typically fall well within her portfolio. For example,where was the director during the planning of one of the biggest national security operations of the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) presidency: the lead-up to the night [Trump attacked Venezuela](https://www.ms.now/opinion/trump-venezuela-nicolas-maduro-regime-change) and captured [President Nicolás Maduro](https://presidencia.gob.ve/Site/Web/Principal/paginas/classPresidente.php) and his wife? She definitely wasn’t in the [Situation Room](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) alongside the national security team. Instead,she was [on the beach in Hawaii.](https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/tulsi-gabbard-venezuela-trump-7506e52e?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqfuFR406gUOGyxjzKTc1dDKljT-mW-LNvjMaj-qd7BtDW3SnlJCXTavw_N2x3k%3D&gaa_ts=697ce1b5&gaa_sig=ex5SPr3PKZZqKTHuTBe066mQTBrz8OuuHhKljV-ui5bqBRVqrkgW8KA4o0BZNgAzUoKasaXd10LoSeO9eCUP1Q%3D%3D). Now,everyone loves a sun salutation,but her availability for yoga on the beach at this moment is also a pretty clear sign that she was not exactly in the inner circle.

But she has been working really,really hard to get back in [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s good graces.

It’s important to remember an exchange [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) had with [Gabbard](https://www.dhs.gov/kristi-noem) during a [Cabinet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/) meeting she actually did attend over the summer. After he asked the former [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) representative about “bags of information” regarding “how corrupt the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf) was,” [Gabbard](https://www.dhs.gov/kristi-noem) said she would “be the first to brief” him once they had more details.

“We are finding documents literally tucked away in the back of safes and random offices,in these bags and in other areas,” [she said](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/_QVz1tKGds4). “Which,again,speaks to the intent of those who are trying to hide the truth from the American people.”

[Gabbard](https://www.dhs.gov/kristi-noem),in her position as the director of national intelligence,assured the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) she was hunting down information to support his widely debunked conspiracy theories about the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf).

Again,that was over the summer,and we have not seen much of her since. That is,until Wednesday,when she was seen [literally creeping in the shadows](https://www.ms.now/news/mark-warner-requests-briefing-on-gabbard-at-fbi-raid-in-georgia) of the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s latest abuse of power in [Fulton County](https://fultoncountyga.gov/),[Georgia](https://www.georgia.gov/).

That’s where federal agents raided the elections office and hauled away pallets of boxes containing ballots from the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf),executing a search warrant sought by [Thomas Albus](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edmo),a [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-appointed U.S. attorney whose district is 500 miles away in [St. Louis](https://www.stlouis-mo.gov/index.cfm).

Two people familiar with the matter told [Bloomberg](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/bondi-hands-st-louis-prosecutor-nationwide-election-fraud-remit) that [Albus](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edmo) was empowered by [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general/) to conduct nationwide investigations into [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s false claims of election fraud.

[Albus](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edmo) isn’t just a typical [MAGA](https://www.d/) loyalist. He was once the right-hand man of former [Missouri Attorney General](https://ago.mo.gov/) [Eric Schmitt](https://www.schmitt.senate.gov/),one of the chief pushers of the Big Lie. Not only did [Schmitt](https://www.schmitt.senate.gov/) sign an amicus brief asking the [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) to overturn the election results back in 2020,but he was also a notorious pusher of election disinformation. Now his protégé is in charge of the nationwide investigations into so-called election fraud.

As for [Gabbard](https://www.dhs.gov/kristi-noem),her job is supposed to be about collecting intelligence from around the world and analyzing it for potential threats to U.S. national security. Yes,those can include legitimate threats to election security,but let’s be real,that is not what we are talking about here. So why was [Gabbard](https://www.dhs.gov/kristi-noem) in [Georgia](https://www.georgia.gov/)?

According to [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/spy-chief-tulsi-gabbard-is-hunting-for-2020-election-fraud-07ea2383?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqdyabdOU2FOXEfb-cq_d0_Awi-AlPxLG5gY493cutFFrPG7-oP8vS9w2TsTptc%3D&gaa_ts=697ce228&gaa_sig=zOr-tZDU-jHl3sneSs5_5Nyh8qwFWCpHRv9CwuAoxa2pnGmCAh0kJxhB3GM87PQZaOW47d4jkPzxzcF30CZ8HA%3D%3D),she is now leading an “[administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)-wide effort to hunt for proof of tampering in the election that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) lost” more than five years ago. While that is itself equal parts embarrassing for him and alarming,what’s really worrisome is what she’s going to do with it.

The [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/) reports that “[Gabbard](https://www.dhs.gov/kristi-noem) is expected to prepare a report on her work,and the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has discussed executive orders on voting ahead of the midterm elections,two of the officials said.”

In other words,this is not just a backward-looking investigation to vindicate an [insecure](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s false election claims. This is about finding excuses to interfere with voting in the next election.

[White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) press secretary [Karoline Leavitt](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-houses-leavitt-keeps-arguing-with-reporters-her-real-fight-is-with-reality) made that crystal clear in her comment to the Journal,saying,“[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his entire team are committed to ensuring a U.S. election can never,ever be rigged again. [Director Gabbard](https://www.dhs.gov/kristi-noem) is playing a key lead role in this important effort.”

On Thursday evening,at the premiere of his wife’s [multimillion-dollar turkey of a movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02V5qxajWNI),[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) also didn’t hide his intentions,telling reporters [Gabbard](https://www.dhs.gov/kristi-noem) was “working very hard on trying to keep the elections safe.”

“She’s done a very good job,” the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) said. “As you know,they got into the votes. They got a signed judge’s order in [Georgia](https://www.georgia.gov/),and you’re going to see some very interesting things happening.”

Everything he does always seems to lead back to finding a way to control how people vote.

Just to put a fine point on this: The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is telling us it is going to use this raid in [Georgia](https://www.georgia.gov/) and any other information it gathers as the basis for a report the [director of national intelligence](https://www.dni.gov/) will file,which will then serve as justification for putting in place more restrictive measures in advance of the next election.

We have long known that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s stolen election conspiracies are completely baseless,and the people who promoted those theories and tried to help him overturn the election results have all faced lawsuits,criminal charges and disbarment for their roles in that scheme. They were completely discredited.

But now the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) appears to want to bring those kooks back into the spotlight.

On Thursday morning,[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s pardon attorney,[Ed Martin](https://www.justice.gov/pardon/staff-profile/pardon-attorney-edward-r-martin-jr),[posted a photo](https://x.com/EdMartinDOJ/status/2016850042942841031/photo/1) from his official government account of himself with election conspiracy theorist [Sidney Powell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sidney-powell-90b35a24/). It included the caption “Good morning,America. How are ya’?”

And remember that late night rage posting? One of those posts was about a debunked conspiracy about [Chinese and Italian satellites](https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-posts-discredited-conspiracy-theories-seizure-2020-ballots/story?id=129669660) somehow being responsible for the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf) results.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is bringing all of his wildest election conspiracies back,not just to gripe about the last election,but to use as some sort of bogus justification to limit voting in the next one.

It’s clear that interfering in that election has been his goal for some time now. Everything he does seems to lead back to finding ways to control how people vote. It’s why he told [Minnesota](https://www.mn.gov/)ns the only way he’d remove [ICE agents](https://www.ice.gov/) from their state is [if they turn over their voter rolls](https://www.ms.now/ali-velshi/minneapolis-shooting-pam-bondi-letter-immigration-crackdown-trump-election-interference).

There is no great mystery about what’s going on here. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is weaker than he’s ever been,the American people are [angrier at him than they’ve ever been](https://www.ms.now/morning-joe/watch/pretty-stunning-trump-s-polling-slips-to-the-lowest-of-his-second-term-2484390467841),and as a result,[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is taking his most drastic step yet to inject chaos into our next election.
