*The [defense](https://www.defense.gov/) [secretary](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/)’s move comes after [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/), a former Navy combat pilot, reminded active service members that they “can refuse illegal orders.”*

[Defense](https://www.defense.gov/) [Secretary Pete Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) announced Monday that he plans to demote the military rank of [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Mark Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/) of Arizona after the retired Navy captain reminded those actively serving to disobey illegal orders.

[Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/), a former combat pilot and astronaut, appeared in a [video](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2558895077819811) in November with five other [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org) lawmakers in which he denounced the administration for pitting service members against U.S. citizens and told those serving that they “can refuse illegal orders,” a basic tenet of U.S. military law.

The lawmakers said they made the remarks partly in response to [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s deployment of troops to major U.S. cities for crime and immigration enforcement operations.

Although all six lawmakers served in either the military or intelligence communities, only [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/) served long enough to formally retire and receive a pension, which [Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) — a former [Army National Guard](https://www.nationalguard.mil/) officer — has noted makes [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/) “still accountable to military justice.”

After the video was published, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) accused the lawmakers of sedition, calling their actions “punishable by DEATH” on social media. [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/), like other lawmakers in the video, has said that he and his wife — former Rep. Gabby Giffords, who survived being shot in the head in 2011 while a member of Congress — received [threats](https://www.ms.now/news/jason-crow-death-threats-trump-seditious-behavior-rcna245193) after the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s posts.

In Monday’s social media post, [Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) argued that [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/)’s comments violate Articles 133 and 134 of the [Uniform Code of Military Justice](https://jsc.defense.gov/Portals/99/Documents/UCMJ%20-%2020December2019.pdf), which refer to “conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman” and general misconduct. [Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) said on X that the message in the video was “clearly intended to undermine good order and military discipline.” [Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) said he issued a “letter of censure” to [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/), calling it a first step toward a demotion and a decrease in pension.

Censure is a formal disciplinary action, sometimes punitive, that can only be issued by someone in a service member’s chain of command. If successful, it can result in demotion of a service member’s rank and a reduction in their retirement pay.

[Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/) has 30 days to formally respond to the letter, but he immediately fired back on social media.

“My rank and retirement are things that I earned through my service and sacrifice for this country. I got shot at. I missed holidays and birthdays,” [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/) said, adding that countless members of the armed forces have done likewise.

“[Pete Hegseth](https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/4040890/hon-pete-hegseth/) wants to send the message to every single retired servicemember that if they say something he or [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) doesn’t like, they will come after them the same way,” [Kelly](https://www.kelly.senate.gov/) wrote.
