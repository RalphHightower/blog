*The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) is engaged in a comprehensive war, and its enemy is half of America.*

Jan. 18, 2026, 6:00 AM EST
By Paul Waldman

On Wednesday, [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [shouted on Truth Social](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115893309945152200), “EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY FIRST, NO MORE PAYMENTS WILL BE MADE BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO STATES FOR THEIR CORRUPT CRIMINAL PROTECTION CENTERS KNOWN AS SANCTUARY CITIES.” What did he mean by “payments”? Highway funds, [Medicare](https://www.medicare.gov/) reimbursements to hospitals, education programs? No one seems to know, least of all [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) himself.

> **There is no precedent in modern times for this.**

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) can’t just shut off all federal funding to states he doesn’t like. But no one doubts he would if he could — or doubts he’s trying to. This is more than bloviation. Something important and dangerous is happening. The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) is engaged in a comprehensive war, and its enemy is half of America. This war is being waged in rhetoric and regulation, budget cuts and violence. Its aim is to tear the country in two. 

There is no precedent in modern times for this; one might make an analogy to Reconstruction in the wake of the Civil War, in which the federal government forced the South to accept democracy. But that was for the best of reasons, and [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s attempt to bend blue states to his will is for the worst.

We’re seeing the ugliest face of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s plan in [Minnesota](https://www.mn.gov/). [Minneapolis](https://www.minneapolismn.gov/) is under siege from roving gangs of masked federal thugs. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) promised a “DAY OF RECKONING & RETRIBUTION” against the city and the state of [Minnesota](https://www.mn.gov/), and he is already delivering. Even before an [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) officer shot dead Renee Good, ill-trained and overly aggressive agents rampaged through the community, brutalizing people, lobbing tear gas into crowds and spreading an atmosphere of fear that has everyone in the city on edge. [Minnesota](https://www.mn.gov/) [Gov.](https://mn.gov/governor/) [Tim Walz](https://mn.gov/governor/about-gov/timwalz/) wrote on social media this week, “[Minnesota](https://www.mn.gov/) voted against him three times and now he’s punishing us,” and it’s hard to argue, especially since [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is openly talking about “retribution.”

[Minneapolis](https://www.minneapolismn.gov/) is only one of the places [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has sent [National Guard troops](https://www.nationalguard.mil/) and/or large numbers of [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) and [Border Patrol agents](https://www.cbp.gov/). All of those places have been where most of the population votes for [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)s: [Los Angeles](https://lacity.gov/), [Washington](https://dc.gov/), [Memphis](https://memphistn.gov/), [New Orleans](https://nola.gov/). And there will be more places. 

Far less attention has been given to the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s efforts to create two separate systems of federal funding, one for red states and one for blue ones. Fortunately, at least for now, some of those efforts are being blocked by the courts. Last week, a federal judge ruled that the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) had [acted illegally](https://apnews.com/article/trump-clean-energy-democrats-blue-state-hydrogen-9269a5a839122e1b3fd487787747d47e) when it cancelled billions of dollars in environmental grants to  16 states led by [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/). “Defendants freely admit,” the judge noted, “that they made grant-termination decisions primarily — if not exclusively — based on whether the awardee resided in a state whose citizens voted for [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) ]Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) in 2024.”

Last week was not the first time a judge made a similar ruling. In April, another district court [ruled against](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5265622-judge-finds-trumps-sanctuary-cities-order-likely-unconstitutional/) an executive order [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) signed instructing [Secretary](https://www.dhs.gov/kristi-noem) of [Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/) [Kristi Noem](https://www.dhs.gov/kristi-noem) to ensure that sanctuary jurisdictions “do not receive access to federal funds.”

This is a pattern that is being repeated again and again: [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his aides look to remove states run by [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) from national programs or widely distributed funding, as though the only places that deserve the support of the federal government are those that voted for him. The [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) [just announced](https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/06/trump-cut-child-care-funds-00712875), for example, that it is cutting off \$10 billion in child care funding to [California](https://www.ca.gov/), [Illinois](https://www.illinois.gov/), [New York](https://www.ny.gov/), [Minnesota](https://www.mn.gov/) and [Colorado](https://www.colorado.gov/) — all blue states. The [Department of Health and Human Services](https://www.hhs.gov/) [is closing](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-hhs-close-regional-legal-offices_n_67d0c2afe4b08ae973d9446e) six of its 10 field offices — all in blue cities in blue states. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has [withheld disaster aid](https://www.courthousenews.com/trump-slammed-for-covertly-withholding-fema-funds-from-blue-states/) from blue states, a repeat of actions from his first term (in 2018, an aide [convinced him](https://www.eenews.net/articles/helene-isnt-the-first-time-trump-inserted-politics-into-a-natural-disaster/) to release recovery funds to [California](https://www.ca.gov/) by showing him how many votes he got in [Orange County](https://ocgov.com/)). [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [is also moving](https://apnews.com/article/space-command-trump-alabama-colorado-96589ce26df5ddaf59e2fc856084a8ca) the [Space Command](https://www.spacecom.mil/) from [Colorado](https://www.colorado.gov/) to [Alabama](https://www.alabama.gov/). 

Most remarkably — as in the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s filings in the case on environmental grants — officials in [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) don’t even pretend they should serve all Americans equally. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) himself certainly doesn’t. Every day he makes clear that if you support him he likes you, and if you don’t, you’re his enemy.

This is something new in both policy and politics. Sure, federal largesse has often been handed out to those with connections, and members of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) try to steer money to their own districts and states. But we expect every occupant of the [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) to say that they’re the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) of all Americans and reinforce the idea that we are one nation with one fate. 

[Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) have worked hard to make sure their policies benefit red states, both for political reasons and because they clearly believe it’s the right thing to do, especially since the needs in areas like education, health care, and economic development are [often greater](https://www.americashealthrankings.org/explore/measures/Outcomes/ALL) where many [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s live. The [Biden administration](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/), for instance, [made extensive efforts](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/12/19/fact-sheet-president-biden-and-vice-president-harris-are-delivering-for-rural-communities/) to improve life in rural America, where [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)s get precious few votes. And when [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)s wrote the [Inflation Reduction Act](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/PLAW-117publ169), they took pains to direct [the vast majority](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2025/03/clean-energy-generates-major-economic-benefits-especially-in-red-states/) of its climate funds to red states, in the hope that doing so would help protect the programs from future [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) sabotage. (That turned out to be [a miscalculation](https://grist.org/politics/house-republican-tax-bill-inflation-reduction-act-repeal-clean-energy-tax-credits/)).

Like almost all [presidents](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) and [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/), [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) often deployed the lofty rhetoric of unity and common destiny. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) never bothers. He has a long list of those who are not quite American in his eyes: immigrants from the wrong places, journalists, trans people or even just [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/). “They hate our country” is one of his most oft-used descriptions of Americans who dare to criticize him. He thinks he gets to define who is part of our country, and if you didn’t vote for him, you don’t qualify.
