## [Federal Reserve Board - Federal Reserve issues FOMC statement](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20260128a.htm)

January 28, 2026

For release at 2:00 p.m. EST

Available indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace. Job gains have remained low, and the unemployment rate has shown some signs of stabilization. Inflation remains somewhat elevated.

The [Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated. The [Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.

In support of its goals, the [Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 3‑1/2 to 3‑3/4 percent. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the [Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The [Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.

In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the [Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The [Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the [Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm)'s goals. The [Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm)'s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.

Voting for the monetary policy action were [Jerome H. Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm), Chair; [John C. Williams](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/federal-reserve-system-new-york.htm), Vice Chair; [Michael S. Barr](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/barr.htm); [Michelle W. Bowman](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/bowman.htm); [Lisa D. Cook](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/cook.htm); [Beth M. Hammack](https://www.clevelandfed.org/people/profiles/h/hammack-beth-m); [Philip N. Jefferson](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/jefferson.htm); [Neel Kashkari](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/people/neel-kashkari); [Lorie K. Logan](https://www.dallasfed.org/fed/leadership/logan); and [Anna Paulson](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/our-people/anna-paulson). Voting against this action were [Stephen I. Miran](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/miran.htm) and [Christopher J. Waller](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/waller.htm), who preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point at this meeting.
