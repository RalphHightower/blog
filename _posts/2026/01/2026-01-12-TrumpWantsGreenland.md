## [‘Whether they like it or not’: Trump ups the ante in his crusade for Greenland](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-greenland-whether-they-like-it-or-not)

*When [Brendan Carr](https://www.fcc.gov/about/leadership/brendan-carr) said, “We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” it sparked a controversy. It was no better when the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) used the same phrase.*

In the recent past, we might have expected to see foreign critics referring to the United States as a “predator” nation, a label many Americans would have seen as insulting.

But last week, [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Andy Ogles (T-TN5)](https://ogles.house.gov/) appeared on [Faux Business](https://www.foxbusinesd.com/), where the [scandal-plagued](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/federal-prosecutors-withdraw-investigation-targeting-gops-andy-ogles-rcna190197) [congressman](https://ogles.house.gov/) [described the U.S. “the dominant predator”](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3mbtj6wsb5g2z) in the Western Hemisphere — and he meant it as a compliment.

The larger question, however, is whether [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) shares his perspective.

At a [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) event on Friday, ostensibly about domestic oil companies and [Venezuela](https://gob.ve/), the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) took the opportunity to [share some fresh thoughts](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-oil-gas-executives-january-9-2026/) about his crusade to acquire [Greenland](https://naalakkersuisut.gl/), including his insistence that his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) intends to “do something” on the [Arctic island](https://naalakkersuisut.gl/), “whether they like it or not.”

The [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) added that [he likes Denmark](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3mbzfvsevpf2t), but “The fact that they had a boat land \[on [Greenland](https://naalakkersuisut.gl/)] 500 years ago doesn’t mean they own the land. I’m sure we had lots of boats go there also.” (As [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) probably ought to know, the United States didn’t exist 500 years ago.)

My favorite moment was when the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) said, “If we [don’t take [Greenland](https://naalakkersuisut.gl/), you’re going to have [Russia](http://government.ru/) or [China](https://www.gov.cn/) as your next-door neighbor. That’s not going to happen.”

It was a comment that suggested (a) he doesn’t know that [Russia](http://government.ru/) or [China](https://www.gov.cn/) couldn’t seize [Greenland](https://naalakkersuisut.gl/) without triggering a [NATO](https://www.nato.int/) response; (b) [Greenland](https://naalakkersuisut.gl/) is not [the United States’ next-door neighbor](https://www.nps.gov/anch/learn/historyculture/how-close-is-alaska-to-russia.htm); and (c) [Russia](http://government.ru/) already is the United States’ next-door neighbor.

But the pièce de résistance was [Trump declaring](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3mbzfu25zvh2z), “I would like to make a deal the easy way, but if we don’t do it the easy way, we’re going to do it the hard way.”

In September, when the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) went after late-night host [Jimmy Kimmel](https://abc.com/show/9bfe2f4f-41ad-4492-a6dd-0b67db180543), the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s [Federal Communications Commission](https://www.fcc.gov/) chair, [Brendan Carr](https://www.fcc.gov/about/leadership/brendan-carr), appeared on a far-right podcast and mentioned his agency’s role [in granting broadcast licenses](https://bsky.app/profile/thebulwark.com/post/3lz2kciqfhs2c). Referring specifically to [Kimmel](https://abc.com/show/9bfe2f4f-41ad-4492-a6dd-0b67db180543)’s monologue related to [Charlie Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/), [Carr added](https://www.ms.now/top-stories/latest/jimmy-kimmel-pulled-abc-charlie-kirk-nexstar-rcna232036), “When we see stuff like this, look, we can do this the easy way or the hard way.”

Marveling at [Carr](https://www.fcc.gov/about/leadership/brendan-carr)’s choice of words, [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Ted Cruz (T-TX)](https://www.cruz.senate.gov/) described [Carr](https://www.fcc.gov/about/leadership/brendan-carr)’s threats as [reminiscent of organized crime](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/fcc-kimmel-ted-cruz-first-amendment-rcna232900). “He says, ‘We can do this the easy way, or we can do this the hard way,” the senator said on his podcast, quoting [Carr](https://www.fcc.gov/about/leadership/brendan-carr). “And I’ve got to say, that’s right out of ‘Goodfellas.’ That’s right out of a mafioso coming into a bar going, ‘Nice bar you have here, it’d be a shame if something happened to it.’”

Four months later, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) is using virtually identical phrasing in pursuit of [Greenland](https://naalakkersuisut.gl/).

In November, [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/)’s [Adam Serwer labeled](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2025/11/mafia-style-american-politics/684863/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s second term as the “mafia presidency,” in which the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) essentially tells his targets, “If you don’t want to get hurt, you’ll do what I say.”

The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) continues to prove the thesis true.
