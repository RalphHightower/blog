Lyrics:

Through the winter’s ice and cold<br />Down Nicollet Avenue<br />A city aflame fought fire and ice<br />‘Neath an occupier’s boots<br />King Trump’s private army from the DHS<br />Guns belted to their coats<br />Came to Minneapolis to enforce the law<br />Or so their story goes<br />Against smoke and rubber bullets<br />By the dawn’s early light<br />Citizens stood for justice<br />Their voices ringing through the night<br />And there were bloody footprints<br />Where mercy should have stood<br />And two dead left to die on snow-filled streets<br />Alex Pretti and Renee Good

Oh our Minneapolis, I hear your voice<br />Singing through the bloody mist<br />We’ll take our stand for this land<br />And the stranger in our midst<br />Here in our home they killed and roamed<br />In the winter of ’26<br />We’ll remember the names of those who died<br />On the streets of Minneapolis

Trump’s federal thugs beat up on<br />His face and his chest<br />Then we heard the gunshots<br />And Alex Pretti lay in the snow, dead<br />Their claim was self defense, sir<br />Just don’t believe your eyes<br />It’s our blood and bones<br />And these whistles and phones<br />Against Miller and Noem’s dirty lies

Oh our Minneapolis, I hear your voice<br />Crying through the bloody mist<br />We’ll remember the names of those who died<br />On the streets of Minneapolis

Now they say they’re here to uphold the law<br />But they trample on our rights<br />If your skin is black or brown my friend<br />You can be questioned or deported on sight

In chants of ICE out now<br />Our city’s heart and soul persists<br />Through broken glass and bloody tears<br />On the streets of Minneapolis

Oh our Minneapolis, I hear your voice<br />Singing through the bloody mist<br />Here in our home they killed and roamed<br />In the winter of ’26<br />We’ll take our stand for this land<br />And the stranger in our midst<br />We’ll remember the names of those who died<br />On the streets of Minneapolis<br />We’ll remember the names of those who died<br />On the streets of Minneapolis
