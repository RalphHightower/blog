## [Tulsi Gabbard’s role in the FBI’s Fulton County raid goes from bad to worse](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/tulsi-gabbard-role-fbi-fulton-county-raid-election-2020)

_The [DNI](https://www.dni.gov/) is legally prohibited from taking part in domestic law enforcement. So why was she with the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) in [Georgia](https://www.georgia.gov/)?_

Jan. 30,2026,1:08 PM EST
By [Steve Benen](https://www.ms.now/author/steve-benen)

Even if we were to remove [Director of National Intelligence](https://www.dni.gov/) [Tulsi Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) from the equation altogether,the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/)’s [execution of a search warrant](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/as-the-fbi-searches-fulton-co-trumps-2020-election-fixation-has-escalated-beyond-whining) at the [Fulton County](https://fultoncountyga.gov/) elections office near [Atlanta](https://www.atlantaga.gov/) [as part of Donald Trump’s ongoing crusade](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/as-the-fbi-searches-fulton-co-trumps-2020-election-fixation-has-escalated-beyond-whining) related to his [2020 election defeat](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf) would still be awfully tough to defend.

There’s no credible reason for federal law enforcement to seize these election materials,which have already been thoroughly scrutinized,just as there’s no reason for the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) to act as a vehicle for the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s discredited conspiracy theories. What’s more,as [The New York Times noted](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/30/us/politics/georgia-trump-election.html) noted,there are also related concerns about whether this “might also be a harbinger of things to come,signaling [Mr. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s growing willingness to use the vast powers of federal law enforcement to intervene in election matters in the lead-up to the critical 2026 midterms,which will determine the extent of his authority for the remainder of his second term.”

But that [Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence),[eager to work her way back](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/why-did-tulsi-gabbard-join-an-fbi-raid-tied-to-trumps-election-conspiracy-theory) into the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s good graces,[personally participated in the raid](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/why-did-tulsi-gabbard-join-an-fbi-raid-tied-to-trumps-election-conspiracy-theory) in [Georgia](https://www.georgia.gov/),adds a scandalous element to a burgeoning controversy. As a [Politico report](https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/29/tulsi-gabbard-2020-election-investigation-00755487):

_[Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)s,election experts and even some members of the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) expressed alarm and bewilderment about why [Tulsi Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) was on the scene as the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) raided a [Georgia](https://www.georgia.gov/) election office that has been at the center of [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s debunked claims that the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf) was stolen._

_The [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s official line is that the [DNI](https://www.dni.gov/) “has a pivotal role in election security and protecting the integrity of our elections against interference,including operations targeting voting systems,databases,and election infrastructure.”_

That might sound vaguely reasonable — except as [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Mark Warner (D-VA)](https://www.warner.senate.gov/),the top [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) on the [Senate Intelligence Committee](https://ww w.intelligence.senate.gov/),[explained](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/why-did-tulsi-gabbard-join-an-fbi-raid-tied-to-trumps-election-conspiracy-theory),if [Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) had reason to believe [Georgia](https://www.georgia.gov/)’s ballots had been compromised by foreign actors (a highly dubious idea,to be sure),it’d be incumbent on her to bring those concerns to the attention of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/)’ intelligence committees — which she has not done.

If she doesn’t have reason to believe [Georgia](https://www.georgia.gov/)’s ballots were compromised by foreign actors,then she had no business showing up at [Fulton County](https://fultoncountyga.gov/)’s election offices.

As [NBC News explained](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/tulsi-gabbard-scrutiny-showing-fbi-raid-georgia-election-hub-rcna256525),“Accompanying [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) agents on a raid is unprecedented for the chief of U.S. intelligence,whose job is to track threats from foreign adversaries. In her role overseeing the country’s spy agencies,[Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) is prohibited by law from taking part in domestic law enforcement. Her predecessors took pains to keep their distance from [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) cases or partisan politics.”

The [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/),meanwhile,[reported](https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/spy-chief-tulsi-gabbard-is-hunting-for-2020-election-fraud-07ea2383?st=h3MkjY&) that the [DNI](https://www.dni.gov/)’s appearance in [Fulton County](https://fultoncountyga.gov/) was part of a larger pattern of efforts:

_[Tulsi Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence),the [director of national intelligence](https://www.dni.gov/),has spent months investigating the results of the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf) that [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) lost,according to [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) officials,a role that took her to a related [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) search of an election center in [Georgia](https://www.georgia.gov/) on Wednesday._

_[Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) is leading the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s effort to re-examine the election and look for potential crimes,a priority for the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/),the officials said._

If the [Journal](https://www.wsj.com/)’s report,which has not been independently verified by [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/),is correct,it would suggest that [Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) has spent the past several months less focused on her actual job — providing the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) with accurate intelligence related to potential national security decisions — and more focused on [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s ridiculous conspiracy theories about his [2020 defeat](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf).

This dovetails with [Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence)’s efforts last year related to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Russia](http://kremlin.ru) scandal,which culminated in the [DNI](https://www.dni.gov/) throwing around words such as “[treason](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/dni-gabbard-reportedly-overrode-cia-officials-concerns-push-conspirato-rcna223478)” while issuing [evidence-free findings that proved baseless](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/pressed-evidence-conspiracy-theories-tulsi-gabbard-falls-embarrassingl-rcna223693).

Who,if anyone,did the job of the [DNI](https://www.dni.gov/) while the former congresswoman chased conspiratorial mirages is unclear.

[Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)s on [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/)’ intelligence committees have [demanded a briefing](https://www.ms.now/news/mark-warner-requests-briefing-on-gabbard-at-fbi-raid-in-georgia) on [Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence)’s antics,though she has yet to respond to their directive. Watch this space.
