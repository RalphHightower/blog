## [Protests swell over ICE killing of Minneapolis woman as White House blames victim](https://www.ms.now/news/minneapolis-police-detain-at-least-30-protesting-ice-killing-of-local-woman)

*[White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) press secretary Karoline Leavitt described Renee Nicole Good as a "leftist insurrectionist" on Saturday.*

Thousands of demonstrators turned out in [Minneapolis](https://www.minneapolismn.gov/) on Saturday to protest an [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) officer’s killing of [Renee Nicole Good](https://www.ms.now/news/minneapolis-woman-killed-by-ice-agent-was-a-mother-a-poet-and-a-wife), whom the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) vilified as a “leftist insurrectionist” and blamed for the fatal shooting.

“This woman was not ‘an innocent mother dropping off her child at school,’” [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on X, citing new video that purports to show Good blocking the street with her car before the deadly encounter with the [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) official. The video has not been independently verified by [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/).

“She was a leftist insurrectionist who was purposefully and illegally obstructing law enforcement operations,” Leavitt added.

Demonstrators gathered in [Minneapolis](https://www.minneapolismn.gov/) and in other cities across the country on Saturday to protest the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s immigration tactics, with more than 1,000 events expected to be held on Saturday and Sunday, according to [Indivisible](https://indivisible.org/), a grassroots progressive organization.

[Minneapolis](https://www.minneapolismn.gov/) [police](https://www.minneapolismn.gov/government/departments/police/) said at least 30 people were detained during a Friday night protest.

“Over the course of the night, individuals threw snow, ice, and rocks at officers, police vehicles, and other vehicles in the roadway,” according to a [Minneapolis Police Department](https://www.minneapolismn.gov/government/departments/police/) statement.

[Police](https://www.minneapolismn.gov/government/departments/police/) said property was damaged and that one officer sustained minor injuries that did not require medical attention as a large crowd moved between two hotels where [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) agents were believed to be staying. Several people “were detained, cited, and released.”

[Minneapolis](https://www.minneapolismn.gov/) [Mayor](https://www.minneapolismn.gov/government/mayor/) [Jacob Frey](https://www.minneapolismn.gov/government/mayor/about-the-mayor/) said Saturday morning that demonstrators were largely peaceful, and that he saw footage of what he described as an “agitator, clearly from the far right” who was trying to rile up the crowd.

“It was so awesome that not only was the crowd not taking the bait, they were basically blowing them off. They were grinning down the bear,” [Frey](https://www.minneapolismn.gov/government/mayor/about-the-mayor/) said. “And I think that is emblematic of what’s happening in [Minneapolis](https://www.minneapolismn.gov/) right now.” He added, “We are meeting a whole lot of despair with a lot of hope.”

[Minneapolis](https://www.minneapolismn.gov/) officials say federal agents have caused chaos in the city and endangered residents. [Police Chief Brian O’Hara](https://www.minneapolismn.gov/government/departments/police/police-chief-administration/) said Saturday federal immigration officers are conducting raids “across all parts of the city” in which people are arrested and their vehicles abandoned — including one with dog left inside.

[Frey](https://www.minneapolismn.gov/government/mayor/about-the-mayor/) called those operations “reckless,” citing an incident in which [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) officials detained a person and left their car “in the middle of the street.”

“The car wasn’t even in park and so you’ve got this vehicle that is just rolling down the street with nobody in it,” he said. “So this is not about safety, clearly. If this was about safety, you wouldn’t do stupid things like that. Somebody’s going to get hurt, somebody has gotten killed.”

The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has [deployed a surge of federal agents to Minnesota](https://www.ms.now/news/dhs-deploying-a-surge-of-federal-agents-to-minnesota) this week as part of an immigration enforcement operation focused on the state’s Somali community, sparking intense criticism from lawmakers.

On Saturday, three [Minneapolis](https://www.minneapolismn.gov/) [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) — [Reps.](https://www.house.gov/) [Ilhan Omar (D-MN5)](https://omar.house.gov/), [Angie Craig (D-MN2)](https://craig.house.gov/) and [Kelly Morrison (D-MN4)](https://morrison.house.gov/) — tried to access an [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) facility in [St. Paul](https://www.stpaul.gov/) to conduct congressional oversight but said they were denied entry. At a news conference afterward, [Craig](https://craig.house.gov/) called on [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) to “stand up” to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).

“This is beyond the pale. This [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) continues to use [Minneapolis](https://www.minneapolismn.gov/) as a political stunt, and earlier this week, it got a woman killed,” [Craig](https://craig.house.gov/) said.

The [Minneapolis](https://www.minneapolismn.gov/) shooting has become a heated political flashpoint.

The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has doubled down on a narrative of self-defense, claiming that Good tried to run over the [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) officer, identified as [Jonathan Ross](https://www.ms.now/news/jonathan-ross-ice-shooting-minneapolis). On Friday, [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) called the slain mother of three “an agitator” and he [claimed on social media](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115855701696773990) that she “violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) officer,” who then shot her in self-defense.

That [claim is contradicted](https://www.ms.now/news/new-video-ice-officer-shooting-renee-good-minneapolis) by multiple videos showing that Good appeared to be turning to the right to drive away from Ross, who positioned himself in front of the car before shooting and killing Good.

[Vice President JD Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance) said at the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) on Thursday that Ross is “protected by absolute immunity.” But [Minneapolis](https://www.minneapolismn.gov/) [Attorney General](https://www.ag.state.mn.us/) [Keith Ellison](https://www.ag.state.mn.us/Office/AGBio.asp) said on [MS NOW’s “The Weekend” show](https://www.ms.now/the-weekend/watch/there-is-no-debate-minnesota-has-right-to-prosecute-ice-agent-ag-keith-ellison-2480688707706) Saturday that his state has every right to prosecute the [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) agent.

Anger over federal agents’ presence and their documented use of excessive force in cites nationwide has also grown after a [Customs and Border Patrol](https://www.cbp.gov/) agent shot two people in [Portland](https://www.portland.gov/), [Oregon](https://www.oregon.gov/Pages/index.aspx), on Thursday.

The [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/) labeled the two people shot as “suspected Tren de Aragua gang associates” and said that they “weaponized their vehicle” against the agents, fled the scene, then called emergency medical services.

[Portland](https://www.portland.gov/) [Police](https://www.portland.gov/police-and-safety) [Chief](https://www.portland.gov/police/chiefs-office) [Bob Day](https://www.portland.gov/police/chiefs-office) said Saturday that the two people shot there are in stable condition and in federal custody. He also said they “do have some nexus to involvement” with Tren de Aragua. 

The shootings in [Minneapolis](https://www.minneapolismn.gov/) and [Portland](https://www.portland.gov/) [have reinvigorated calls](https://www.axios.com/2026/01/09/kristi-noem-impeachment-minneapolis-portland-ice) among [congressional](https://www.congress.gov/) [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) to impeach [Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/) [Secretary Noem](https://www.dhs.gov/kristi-noem), who has been the face of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s mass deportation efforts.
