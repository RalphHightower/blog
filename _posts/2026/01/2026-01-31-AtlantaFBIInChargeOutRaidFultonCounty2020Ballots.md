_Paul Brown was removed after expressing concerns about the bureau’s investigation into [Fulton County](https://fultoncountyga.gov/)’s [2020 election results](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf),sources told [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/)._

Jan. 30,2026,2:42 PM EST
By [Ken Dilanian](https://www.ms.now/author/ken-dilanian-2) and [Ebony Davis](https://www.ms.now/author/ebony-davis)

The special agent in charge of the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/)’s [Atlanta field office](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/atlanta) was forced out this month after questioning the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/)’s renewed push to probe [Fulton County](https://fultoncountyga.gov/)’s role in the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf),two people familiar with the matter told [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/).

Paul Brown was ousted after expressing concerns about the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/)’s investigation into [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s longstanding and unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud in the county anchored by [Atlanta](https://www.atlantaga.gov/),and for refusing to carry out the searches and seizures of records tied to the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf),according to the sources,who spoke to [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/) on condition of anonymity.

The [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [executed a search warrant](https://www.ms.now/news/fbi-searching-elections-office-in-fulton-county-georgia) Wednesday at the [Fulton County](https://fultoncountyga.gov/) [Elections Hub and Operation Center](https://www.fultoncountyga.gov/inside-fulton-county/fulton-county-departments/registration-and-elections/elections-contacts) near [Atlanta](https://www.atlantaga.gov/),as part of a criminal investigation into records from the [2020 presidential election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf). Authorities seized 700 boxes related to the county’s [2020 general election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf).

Brown was appointed to oversee all investigations and personnel in [Georgia](https://www.georgia.gov/) last February. The [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/) [reported](https://apnews.com/article/fbi-georgia-elections-office-fulton-county-28e736037521b17197760d2394f0ab43) that the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) moved to replace him last week.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has repeatedly amplified the baseless claim that the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf) was “stolen” from him in [Georgia](https://www.georgia.gov/),despite multiple audits,recounts and court rulings confirming that [Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) legitimately won the state’s electoral votes. 

[Fulton County](https://fultoncountyga.gov/) [Chairman Robb Pitts](https://fultoncountyga.gov/Commissioners/Robb-Pitts) called the investigation a distraction and an intimidation tactic from the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/).

“Any honest review of these files will show what every previous review has shown. [Fulton County](https://fultoncountyga.gov/) elections are fair and lawful,and the outcome of the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf) will not change,” Pitts told reporters Thursday.

During a news conference Friday,[Deputy](https://www.justice.gov/dag/) [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Todd Blanche](https://www.justice.gov/dag/) emphasized that election integrity is “important to this [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/),” but did not explicitly comment on the [Georgia](https://www.georgia.gov/) investigation.
