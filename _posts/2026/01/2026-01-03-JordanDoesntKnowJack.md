## [What Jack Smith’s testimony on the 2020 election reveals about Trump and his allies](https://www.ms.now/opinion/jack-smith-testimony-trump-2020-election-new-years-eve)

*The former special prosecutor’s testimony will help history judge [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s attempt to hold onto power after losing the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf).*

By Austin Sarat

[Republican](https://www.gop.com/) members of the [House Judiciary Committee](https://judiciary.house.gov/) chose New Year’s Eve as the time to release the deposition of former special prosecutor [Jack Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith), which was taken weeks ago. Reading the transcripts, it’s easy to see why the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) dumped it on a day when fewer Americans would be paying attention to the news: [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) made them look foolish.

[Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith)’s testimony [served as a refresher course](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/31/takeaways-jack-smith-congressional-testimony-00708747) for Americans who might have forgotten what [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) did to try to hold onto power after losing the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf), as well as the cavalier way he dealt with sensitive national security information after leaving the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). It will also help ensure that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) will not escape the judgment of history.

> **It’s easy to see why the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) dumped it on a day when fewer Americans would be paying attention to the news: [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) made them look foolish.**

[Smith methodically put to rest](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/31/us/politics/jack-smith-deposition-house-trump.html) [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) suggestions that he was a political hitman and [reminded](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/31/g-s1-104190/capitol-riot-trump-jack-smith-transcript) the American people of the many ways the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) continues to use the justice system to launch baseless attacks on his political opponents and people who had the temerity to insist that he was not, and is not, above the law. All told, not bad for a couple of hours spent answering questions before a highly partisan congressional committee.

Throughout his deposition, [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) did what skilled witnesses do. He never got over his skis, saying, “I can’t recall,” rather than issuing flat denials when he was asked about particular facts. And he controlled the narrative, using unfriendly as well as friendly questions from the [Judiciary Committee](https://judiciary.house.gov/)’s [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) members to lay out a compelling case that he and his colleagues had conducted their investigation of the former [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) with utmost professionalism and without a hint of political bias.

Take this exchange, in which a [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) committee member (whose identity is redacted) asked what the interrogator thought would be a decisive tell. “Was there ever a prospect after you were appointed special counsel when you thought maybe you would not bring an indictment against [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)?”

In volleyball, that is called a set. Not missing the opportunity, [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) spiked the ball.

“Absolutely. When I took this case,” he patiently explained, “I did not know enough about the facts or the law to have a judgment about whether we should proceed in either case. …  If the facts and the law did not justify going forward in this case, I would have been perfectly comfortable in doing that, as I have throughout my career in cases involving political figures. … So I did not have a preconceived outcome in mind when I took this job.”

Then, violating the first rule of good interrogation, not to pose questions unless you already know the answer, his [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) questioner asked, “Was there any point where you and your prosecutors that formed your team debated not bringing charges against the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)?”

[Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith)’s answer: “Of course. I mean, that is the process of being a prosecutor, is you are analyzing evidence, you are collecting facts, and you’re debating whether it’s — what the facts mean, the inferences to be drawn from the facts, or debating what the law is and whether you can prove what you think is happening here or not. And so that was a continual process to decide if, in fact, we could go forward.”

[Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) made a similar skillful pivot in response to a question about why he had sought phone records for nine [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [U.S. senators](https://www.senate.gov/), but not for any [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/), during his investigation. He described his adherence to long-established [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) practice, including consulting experts in its [Public Integrity Section](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-pin).

> **[Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith)’s deft testimony showed why, had the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) gone to trial, he would not be in the [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) today.**

He followed that with a devastating turnabout, saying it was the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) himself who led him to focus on those people. “These records are people, in the case of the [senators](https://www.senate.gov/),” [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) observed, “[Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) directed his co-conspirators to call these people to further delay the proceedings. He chose to do that.”

“If [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/),” [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) continued, “had chosen to call a number of [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) senators, we would have gotten toll records for [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)ic senators. So, responsibility for why these records, why we collected them, that’s — that lies with [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). “

Then, throwing a boomerang of accusations that he politicized justice, [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) laid out in detail how, soon after taking office, the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) went after anyone associated with his investigation of the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) labeled that a “travesty” and calmly, but forcefully, detailed the consequences of the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s actions.

“I think when you fire people who are career public servants serving both parties over many decades, you … lose the expertise about how to do the job properly. And that has an effect on the [Department](https://www.justice.gov/) today, and it will have an effect on the [Department](https://www.justice.gov/) for some time, if those people aren’t there to be leaders and to teach young lawyers how to be public servants.”

[Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) added that he had no doubt “that [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wants to seek retribution against me because of my role as special counsel.”

Finally, >Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) used his testimony to put on the public record that the evidence he collected was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) had violated the law in the classified documents case and “that [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was by a large measure the most culpable and most responsible person in this (the January 6) conspiracy.”

“These crimes,” [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) said, “were committed for his benefit. The attack that happened at the Capitol … does not happen without him … So in terms of why we would pursue a case against him, I entirely disagree with any characterization that our work was in any way meant to hamper him in the [\[2024\] presidential election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/2024presgeresults.pdf).”

[Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith) emphasized that his team’s case was built on evidence provided by “[Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s who put their allegiance to the country before the party.”

Game, set, match to [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith).

His deft testimony showed why, had the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) gone to trial, he would not be in the [Oval Office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) today. And it showed that his [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) interrogators are not the kind of people who put “country before party.”
