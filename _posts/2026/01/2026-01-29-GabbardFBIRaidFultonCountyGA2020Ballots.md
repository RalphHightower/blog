_The [director of national intelligence](https://www.dni.gov/) was looking for ways to return to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s good graces. She apparently found one in an unexpected place._

By [Steve Benen](https://www.ms.now/author/steve-benen)

[Director of National Intelligence](https://www.dni.gov/) [Tulsi Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence),whom [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) elevated last year to a job she was [unqualified and unprepared](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/new-revelations-complicate-gabbard-rfk-jr-confirmation-fights-rcna190496) for,had an [exceedingly difficult](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/dni-gabbard-missing-from-the-stage-amid-ongoing-international-crises) 2025. As the year progressed,the former U.S. representative found herself [left out of](https://www.axios.com/2025/06/10/trump-camp-david-iran-gaza-meeting) important strategy sessions [and briefings](https://politicalwire.com/2025/06/27/quote-of-the-day-4199/),apparently having fallen out of favor with [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).

Earlier this month,it appeared that the [Hawaiian](https://www.hawaii.gov/)’s 2026 was shaping up to be another disaster: Amid multiple international crises,[Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) was [on the outside looking in](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/dni-gabbard-missing-from-the-stage-amid-ongoing-international-crises). Some [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) aides [reportedly joked](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-08/us-spy-chief-gabbard-excluded-from-maduro-plan-over-past-views) that the acronym of her title,[DNI](https://www.dni.gov/),stood for “Do Not Invite.”

But as January nears its end,it appears [Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) has found a new way to return to the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s good graces.

[FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) agents executed a search warrant on Wednesday at the [Fulton County](https://fultoncountyga.gov/) elections office near [Atlanta](https://www.atlantaga.gov/),[as part of the president’s ongoing crusade](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/as-the-fbi-searches-fulton-co-trumps-2020-election-fixation-has-escalated-beyond-whining) related to his [2020 election defeat](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf). The developments were,by any fair measure,ridiculous,though they were made slightly worse by [Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence)’s in-person participation. [Reuters reported](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fbi-executing-search-warrant-election-office-georgia-related-2020-vote-fox-news-2026-01-28/):

> _[Director of National Intelligence](https://www.dni.gov/) [Tulsi Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) visited the site of the search on Wednesday,[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/) witnessed,giving her a highly unusual presence in domestic law enforcement that one former official called unprecedented. [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/) reported that [Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) last year formed a group of dozens of officials from across the federal government,including the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/),that was helping to steer [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s drive for retribution against his perceived enemies._

In case there are any lingering doubts about whether it was actually her in [Fulton County](https://fultoncountyga.gov/),there is a photograph of her at the site,which was promoted online by [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Mark Warner (D-VA)](https://www.warner.senate.gov/),the top [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) on the [Senate Intelligence Committee](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/).

[Warner](https://www.warner.senate.gov/) [issued a written statement](https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2026/1/warner-why-is-tulsi-gabbard-in-fulton-county) about this,explaining,“There are only two explanations for why the [Director of National Intelligence](https://www.dni.gov/) would show up at a federal raid tied to [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s obsession with losing the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf). Either [Director Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) believes there was a legitimate foreign intelligence nexus — in which case she is in clear violation of her obligation under the law to keep the intelligence committees ‘fully and currently informed’ of relevant national security concerns — or she is once again demonstrating her utter lack of fitness for office that she holds by injecting the nonpartisan intelligence community she is supposed to be leading into a domestic political stunt designed to legitimize conspiracy theories that undermine our democracy.”

The [Democratic senator](https://www.warner.senate.gov/) concluded,“Either is a serious breach of trust that further underscores why she is totally unqualified to hold a position that demands sound judgment,apolitical independence,and a singular focus on keeping Americans safe.”

By way of a defense,a [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) official said in a statement that [Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) “has a pivotal role in election security and protecting the integrity of our elections against interference,including operations targeting voting systems,databases,and election infrastructure.”

That might sound vaguely,except as [Warner](https://www.warner.senate.gov/) made clear,if the [DNI](https://www.dni.gov/) had reason to believe [Georgia](https://www.georgia.gov/)’s ballots had been compromised by foreign actors — a highly dubious idea,to be sure — it’d be incumbent on her to bring these concerns to the attention of Congress’ intelligence committees,which she has not done.

For his part,[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has also not commented publicly,though he did use his social media platform to publish a blizzard of new and conspiratorial items about his 2020 defeat on Wednesday night and Thursday morning,[including one](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115978031218105674) that touted [Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) joining [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) officials on Wednesday.

The [DNI](https://www.dni.gov/) is [reportedly scheduled to appear](https://bsky.app/profile/ericjgeller.com/post/3mdlak5tabc2k) at the winter meeting of the [National Association of Secretaries of State](https://www.nass.org/) in [Washington](https://dc.gov/) on Friday,joining [Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/) [Secretary Kristi Noem](https://www.dhs.gov/kristi-noem) and [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general),though it’s not yet clear whether her remarks will include any references to her bizarre appearance in [Georgia](https://www.georgia.gov/). Watch this space.

This post,which has been revised to include a statement from the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/),updates our [related earlier coverage](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/dni-gabbard-missing-from-the-stage-amid-ongoing-international-crises).
