## [Trump picks the wrong time to lie to the public about grocery prices](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-picks-the-wrong-time-to-lie-to-the-public-about-grocery-prices)

*On Tuesday morning, the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) acknowledged a spike in grocery prices. On Tuesday afternoon, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) played make-believe anyway.*

Those hoping to see [American consumers](https://www.ms.now/opinion/economy-irresponsible-consumers-fox-business) catch a break received another round of discouraging news this week, specifically related to [grocery prices](https://www.ms.now/opinion/trump-grocery-prices-economy-speech). [Axios reported](https://www.axios.com/2026/01/13/inflation-cpi-grocery-prices):

> *Grocery prices (or “food at home,” as the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/) calls it) rose by 0.7% in December, the largest monthly gain since the peak inflation period in August 2022. Food inflation was evident at restaurants, too: Costs for dining out (or “food away from home”) rose by a similar amount, the largest monthly gain in three years. […]*

Grocery prices were up roughly 2.4% in December compared to the prior year. But that masks double-digit price increases for a slew of household staples over the past 12 months, including coffee (+20%), beef (+16%) and candy (+10%).

With these numbers having been released by his own [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) on Wednesday morning, [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) had little choice but to acknowledge reality a few hours later during his speech in Detroit about the economy.

No, I’m just kidding. The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) lied again anyway.

Grocery prices are starting to go rapidly down,” [the Republican president boasted](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-speech-detroit-economic-club-january-13-2026/), the same day his own [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) told the public that grocery prices are now rising faster than at any time [since the end of the Covid-19 pandemic](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/13/us/trump-news/d2657c88-aa8a-58c9-97b0-c5ac78a251d8?smid=url-share).

About a month after Election Day, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) offered a candid assessment of why he won a second term — and it had nothing to do with immigration, crime, transgender Americans or even the economy in general.

“I won on groceries,” [he said](https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-december-8-2024-n1311184) on [NBC](https://www.nbcnews.com/)’s [“Meet the Press,”](https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press-full-episodes) adding: “I won an election based on that.” Looking ahead, [the Republican went on to vow](https://bsky.app/profile/acyn.bsky.social/post/3lcssg4x3fj23) that he and his incoming team would bring food prices “way down.”

More than a year later, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) keeps pretending he has successfully delivered on that promise — reality be damned.

And while [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s dishonesty is obviously one of his defining traits, this specific deception remains one of his most self-defeating lies.

American consumers go to grocery stores all the time, and they know that prices haven’t gone “way down.” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) can’t simply wave [his hand and Jedi mind-trick](https://www.starwars.com/databank/obi-wan-kenobi) the public into being happy about rising costs.

Common sense might suggest that any political leader in this situation would have the good sense either to avoid the subject or to express some degree of sympathy for angry consumers. But [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), reluctant to acknowledge his long list of failures, has instead decided to tell grocery-buying Americans not to believe their lying eyes — or wallets.
