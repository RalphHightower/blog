## [Mike Johnson still refuses to install plaque to honor Jan. 6 officers](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/january-6-anniversary-plaque-mike-johnson)

*The [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) leader had plenty of time to come up with an excuse for his refusal. He didn’t come up with much.*

Five years after an insurrectionist mob, fueled by [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s election lies, attacked the [U.S. Capitol](https://www.congress.gov/), many of those who remember and lived through the assault are pushing back against [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) efforts to send the violent riot down an Orwellian memory hole.

To that end, [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) are [holding a hearing](https://www.ms.now/news/trump-jan-6-hearing-house-jeffries-elections-pardons) to highlight the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) administration’s threats to free and fair elections; [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) members have [published a report](https://www.ms.now/opinion/jan-6-crimes-trump-pardon-clemency-democrats-report), “One Year Later: Assessing the Public Safety Implications of [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s Mass Pardons of 1,600 January 6th Rioters and Insurrectionists”; and [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) are [speaking out](https://www.ms.now/news/jan-6-democrats-fight-gop-memoryhole-capitol-attack) to remind the public that [the crisis that began on Jan. 6, 2021, has never really ended](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/06/opinion/jamie-raskin-jan-6-anniversary.html).

As it turns out, [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) officials are also making some news related to the anniversary, although of a very different sort.

After the Jan. 6 attack, [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) [agreed to install](https://rollcall.com/2024/01/31/congress-blows-past-deadline-for-jan-6-plaque/) a permanent plaque to honor the law enforcement personnel who helped protect the U.S. [Capitol](https://www.congress.gov/) against pro-[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) rioters. By statute, the plaque was to be placed on the western side of the building by March 2023 and list the names of those who served.

That deadline lapsed almost three years ago. The plaque is done and ready to be installed, but it’s reportedly sitting in a [Capitol](https://www.congress.gov/) basement utility room [surrounded by tools and maintenance equipment](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/05/23/capitol-police-plaque-january-6-trump/).

Architect of the [Capitol](https://www.congress.gov/) Thomas Austin confirmed during a congressional hearing last year that the only thing standing in the way of installing the plaque is the approval from [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Speaker](https://speaker.house.gov/) [Mike Johnson (T-LA4)](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/)’s office — approval the Louisiana [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [has not extended](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/are-republicans-refusing-budge-jan-6-plaque-honoring-law-enforcement-rcna208834) for reasons he’s been reluctant to explain. (Austin also needed approval from Senate leaders, which he has already received.)

On the eve of the Jan. 6 anniversary, the [House speaker](https://speaker.house.gov/) elaborated on his position. [The Associated Press reported](https://apnews.com/article/capitol-riot-jan-6-anniversary-police-plaque-f6fd39b437c339fa9ff477318a7d36e2):

> *\[[Speaker](https://speaker.house.gov/) [Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/)’s] office said in a statement late Monday the statute authorizing the plaque is ‘not implementable’ and proposed alternatives also ‘do not comply.’*

The [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) leader has had quite a bit of time to come up with a coherent explanation for his refusal to honor the officers who protected the [Capitol](https://www.congress.gov/). This, evidently, is what he’s come up with.

Meanwhile, two Jan. 6 police officers, former [Capitol Police Officer](https://www.uscp.gov/) Harry Dunn and current [Metropolitan Police Department](https://mpdc.dc.gov/node) Officer [filed a lawsuit last summer](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/two-jan-6-police-officers-sue-force-us-capitol-install-memorial-plaque-2025-06-12/) to force congressional leaders to follow the law. [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) weighed in on the case last month, telling a federal court to reject the litigation, though the case is still pending.

For their part, many congressional [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)s have replicas of the plaque hung outside their [Capitol](https://www.congress.gov/) Hill offices. If those same [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)s are in the majority after this year’s midterm elections, no one should be surprised if the real plaque is installed where it’s supposed to be in early 2027.
