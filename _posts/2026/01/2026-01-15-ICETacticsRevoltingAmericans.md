<!--Michele Norris, MS NOW Senior Contributing Editor joins Nicolle Wallace on Deadline White House to discuss the growing backlash sweeping the nation to Trump’s immigration enforcement crackdown being carried out by [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/), and how their tactics have led to increased support to abolish or at least reel in the agency.-->

Backlash against [Donald Trump’s](https://www.ms.now/white-house) immigration crackdown is growing. On Wednesday’s [“Deadline: White House,”](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house) [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/)’s [Nicolle Wallace](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/nicolle-wallace-biography-n1157571) explained how the aggressive tactics used by [Immigration and Customs Enforcement](https://www.ice.gov/) agents have led to a rise in support for [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) to abolish or at least to reel in the [agency](https://www.ice.gov/).

“Faced with scene after scene after scene of increasingly brutal conduct by federal agents — often targeted at U.S. citizens these days — and an avalanche of disinformation from [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his [Cabinet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/) about what the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) is actually doing on our streets and in our cities, the American people are, at least for now, choosing to believe their own eyes and their own ears,” she said on Wednesday.

[Wallace](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/nicolle-wallace-biography-n1157571) referred to a new [Economist/YouGov poll](https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/53878-more-americans-view-ice-shooting-minnesota-unjustified-than-justified-january-9-12-2026-economist-yougov-poll) poll that showed, in her words, “growing numbers of Americans reacting to the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) with a rising tide of revulsion and conviction to resist efforts to militarize American cities.”

According to the poll, half of Americans believe the fatal shooting of [Renee Nicole Good](https://www.ms.now/news/minneapolis-woman-killed-by-ice-agent-was-a-mother-a-poet-and-a-wife) by an [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) agent was not justified. Almost the same share, 47%, said the agency is making the country less safe.

When it came to the abolition of the agency altogether, 46% told pollsters they supported the idea. [Wallace](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/nicolle-wallace-biography-n1157571) described that as “a dramatic, seismic political swing,” which she argued was “the consequence” of Americans watching what has unfolded in [Minneapolis](https://www.minneapolismn.gov/) since Good’s killing last week. 

[Wallace](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/nicolle-wallace-biography-n1157571) played clips of recent interactions between residents and federal immigration agents in the city, in which officers used increasingly violent tactics. In one video, [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) agents can be seen [pulling a woman out of her car](https://x.com/noturtlesoup17/status/2011148947411407258), even after she told them she was disabled and on her way to a doctor appointment. Another video showed an officer [kneeling on the neck](https://x.com/krassenstein/status/2010864861765386459) of a protester.

The [“Deadline: White House”](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house) host noted that this was “a particularly shocking and disturbing and jarring image from any standpoint, much less Minneapolis, where [George Floyd](https://www.ms.now/opinion/msnbc-opinion/george-floyd-death-anniversary-congress-police-reform-rcna208268) was murdered five years ago.”

According to [Wallace](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/nicolle-wallace-biography-n1157571), the backlash is now so widespread that it has transcended partisan divides. “This isn’t really right, left,” she explained; it has now entered the “territory of government overreach and what do you want your government to do in the name of its citizens.”
