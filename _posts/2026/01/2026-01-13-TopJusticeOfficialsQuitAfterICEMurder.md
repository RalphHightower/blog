## [Top DOJ officials quit after their division refused to probe Minnesota ICE shooting](https://www.ms.now/news/doj-civil-rights-division-officials-quit-harmeet-dhillon)

*At least ~~four~~ six leaders of the [Civil Rights Division](https://www.justice.gov/crt) resigned because the section's head, [Harmeet Dhillon](https://www.justice.gov/crt/staff-profile/assistant-attorney-general), decided not to investigate shooting of Renee Good.*

By [Carol Leonnig](https://www.ms.now/author/carol-leonnig) and [Ken Dilanian](https://www.ms.now/author/ken-dilanian-2)

At least four leaders of a [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) unit that investigates police killings have resigned in protest over the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s handling of the fatal shooting of a motorist in [Minneapolis](https://www.minneapolismn.gov/) by an [Immigration and Customs Enforcement](https://www.ice.gov/) officer, according to three people briefed on the departures. 

Top leaders of the criminal section of the [Civil Rights Division](https://www.justice.gov/crt) have left their jobs to register their frustration with the department after the [Assistant Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/crt/staff-profile/assistant-attorney-general) for [Civil Rights](https://www.justice.gov/crt) [Harmeet Dhillon](https://www.justice.gov/crt/staff-profile/assistant-attorney-general) decided not to investigate the [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) officer’s [fatal shooting of Renee Good](https://www.ms.now/news/new-video-ice-officer-shooting-renee-good-minneapolis) last week. [The criminal section of the division would normally investigate](https://www.justice.gov/crt/law-enforcement-misconduct#iap) would normally investigate any fatal shooting by a law enforcement officer and specializes in probing potential or alleged abuse or improper use of force by law enforcement. 

The departures – including that of the chief of the section, as well as the principal deputy chief, deputy chief and acting deputy chief – represent the most significant mass resignation at the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) since February.  At that time, five leaders and supervisors of the [department](https://www.justice.gov/)’s [Public Integrity Section](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-pin), which investigates public officials for possible corruption, resigned rather than comply with an appointee of [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s orders to dismiss the bribery case against then-[New York](https://www.nyc.gov/) mayor Eric Adams. 

One source briefed on the reasoning for the resignations said the handling of the [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) shooting was not the only concern for the unit leaders and that some were concerned about other decisions by division leadership.

“Investigating officials to determine if they broke the law, defied policy, failed to deescalate, and resorted to deadly force without basis is one of the [Civil Rights Division](https://www.justice.gov/crt)’s most solemn duties,” said Kristen Clarke, who led the division in the [Biden administration](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/).

“Prosecutors of the [Civil Rights Division](https://www.justice.gov/crt) have, for decades, been the nation’s leading experts in this work.”

A [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) official did not dispute the departures but said the officials had requested early retirement prior to the [Minnesota](https://www.mn.gov/) shooting, adding that “any suggestion to the contrary is false.”

Good’s shooting on Jan. 7 has galvanized [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) and civil libertarians but also frustrated [Minnesota](https://www.mn.gov/) politicians and state police investigators. On Jan. 10, the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) announced it would be handling the investigation of Good’s shooting on its own and  [blocked Minnesota authorities from their typical role in reviewing evidence and investigating the shooting themselves](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/minnesota-democrat-accuses-trump-administration-of-a-cover-up-after-good-shooting). On Tuesday night, the state of [Minnesota](https://www.mn.gov/) and the cities of [Minneapolis](https://www.minneapolismn.gov/) and [Saint Paul](https://www.stpaul.gov/) filed a [lawsuit](https://www.ms.now/news/minnesota-twin-cities-sue-trump-administration-over-surge-of-federal-forces) attempting to block the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s immigration enforcement actions there, which [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/) [Secretary Kristi Noem](https://www.dhs.gov/kristi-noem) announced would grow following Good’s death.

[Vice President JD Vance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/jd-vance/) has defended the [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) officer, saying one day after Good’s death and with no investigation, that the shooting was justified. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) himself made inaccurate claims that Good had “run over” the [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) officer, which video evidence contradicts. 

[Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) accused the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) of trying to seize the evidence in the shooting as part of what they called a coverup.

Late last week, according to a source briefed on the matter, a deputy for [Dhillon](https://www.justice.gov/crt/staff-profile/assistant-attorney-general) relayed to the criminal section that [Dhillon](https://www.justice.gov/crt/staff-profile/assistant-attorney-general) had decided the office would not conduct a separate [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) investigation of the [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) officer and whether he improperly used deadly force.  [Dhillon](https://www.justice.gov/crt/staff-profile/assistant-attorney-general)’s decision not to have her criminal section investigate the [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) officer’s shooting of Good [was first reported by CBS News.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/doj-civil-rights-division-will-not-investigate-minneapolis-ice-shooting-sources-say/).

In the days after the [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) officer shot Good, [Dhillon](https://www.justice.gov/crt/staff-profile/assistant-attorney-general) [retweeted a post on X](https://x.com/haileyggomez/status/2009733826973520212?s=46) in which a prosecutor warned people not to ram [ICE](https://www.ice.gov/) officers because they will use deadly force.  While federal officials claim Good was driving into the officer, video evidence shows her wheels were turned away from him when the officer opened fire and killed her.

The [department](https://www.justice.gov/)’s [Civil Rights Division](https://www.justice.gov/crt) was created in the wake of the [1957 Civil Rights Act](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-71/pdf/STATUTE-71-Pg634.pdf#page=1) to protect the constitutional rights of all Americans. The division had about 380 attorneys when [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) took office in January but quickly saw a large exodus after [Dhillon](https://www.justice.gov/crt/staff-profile/assistant-attorney-general) took the helm, as she insisted the division would align itself with the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s priorities. [She said in April](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3LvR-snNkU) that she welcomed the departures of civil rights lawyers. 

“I think that’s fine,” [Dhillon](https://www.justice.gov/crt/staff-profile/assistant-attorney-general) said. “We don’t want people in the federal government who feel like it’s their pet project to go persecute police department based on statistical evidence or persecute people praying outside abortion facilities instead of doing violence.”

“The job here is to enforce the federal civil rights laws — not woke ideology.”
