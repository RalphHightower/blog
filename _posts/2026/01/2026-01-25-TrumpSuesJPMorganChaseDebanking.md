## [Trump sues JPMorgan, Jamie Dimon over alleged ‘debanking’ and blacklisting](https://www.ms.now/news/trump-sues-jpmorgan-jamie-dimon-over-alleged-debanking-and-blacklisting)

*[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s suit claims the banking behemoth — “at the direction of Dimon” — put the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), his [company and his family](https://www.trump.com/) “on a blacklist.”*

[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) on Thursday sued [JPMorgan Chase](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/) and its [CEO, Jamie Dimon](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/about/leadership/jamie-dimon), for closing his accounts five years ago and allegedly putting him and his family on a “blacklist.”

The lawsuit centers on the banking giant’s closure of several accounts linked to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) in the wake of the [Jan. 6, 2021]({% link January6DocumentDocumentLinks.md %}), attacks on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of [MAGA](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) supporters. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is seeking at least \$5 billion in damages.

In the complaint, filed in Miami-Dade County, [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) alleges that the “debanking” was “a unilateral decision [which] came about as a result of political and social motivations” and criticizes the bank’s “woke” beliefs. The closure of the accounts, the plaintiffs argue, led to financial and reputational harm.

[2026.01.22-Complaint-Filed-Copy.pdf](https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=https://www.ms.now/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026.01.22-Complaint-Filed-Copy.pdf)

The suit alleges that [JPMorgan Chase](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/) “at the direction of [Dimon](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/about/leadership/jamie-dimon) … has unlawfully and unjustifiably published … the names of [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), the [Trump Organization](https://www.trump.com/)) with its affiliated entities, and/or the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) family, on a blacklist.”

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) claims he and his businesses “have always complied with all applicable banking rules and regulations.”

In a statement to [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/), [JPMorgan Chase](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/) [denied that it closed Trump’s accounts for political reasons](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/22/trump-sues-jamie-dimon-jpmorgan-chase.html), “We believe the suit has no merit.”

“We respect the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s right to sue us and our right to defend ourselves — that’s what courts are for,” said Patricia Wexler, the bank’s spokesperson. “[JPMC](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/) does not close accounts for political or religious reasons. We do close accounts because they create legal or regulatory risk for the company. We regret having to do so but often rules and regulatory expectations lead us to do so.”

Wexler added that the bank has been “asking both this [Administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and prior administrations to change the rules and regulations that put us in this position, and we support the Administration’s efforts to prevent the weaponization of the banking.”
