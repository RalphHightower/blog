title: "Call Scripts For January 6 Anniversary In the 18th Century Language of Poor Richard’s Almanack (Ben Franklin)"
---

With this year being the 250<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of the founding of the United States of America, I wanted to instill an 18<sup>th</sup> century vibe, using the wisdom of Ben Franklin's *"Poor Richard’s Almanack"* to my South Carolina delegation in Washington, DC.

[Senator Lindsey Graham (T-SC)](https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/) had a brief moment of clarity after order was restored in [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/), but soon after developed J6 Amnesia. [Wilson (T-SC2)](https://joewilson.house.gov/) and [Scott (T-SC)](https://www.scott.senate.gov/) never achieved clarity of mind.

There was another person, this one based in Columbia, South Carolina, that helped fan the flames of insurrection, [South Carolina](https://www.sc.gov/) [Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/), [Alan Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general/), son of [Joe "You Lie" Wilson](https://joewilson.house.gov/). [Alan](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general/) is also an election denier. He joined an amicus curiae with other states attorneys general seeking to throw out Pennsylvania election results. As such, he was not only complicitant in the election denial, but he was also an active participant.

Hello, my name is Ralph Hightower, a constituent from Chapin, South Carolina. I'm calling to offer wisdom from one of our founding fathers.

“He that lieth down with dogs shall rise up with fleas.” — Poor Richard’s Almanack

In this, the two‑hundred and fiftieth year of our Republic, we recall the old wisdom of our forebears: that danger oft declareth itself long before it arriveth at the door. One if by land, two if by sea — the signal lanterns of a people resolved to keep watch.

So too in our own age were warnings given, plain as any lantern in the steeple. Each man knew his duty; each made his choice; each hath made his bed. And as the dawn broke upon the sixth day of January, the consequences rose with them, clinging as surely as the fleas to the sleeper who lieth down in folly.

For a Republic endureth not by accident, but by the courage of those who choose country over faction, truth over comfort, and memory over convenient forgetfulness.

##### Live Staffer Closing

And yet, among our delegation, some did forsake that courage. Some denied the lawful count outright; others, having spoken truth for but a fleeting moment, did swiftly retreat from it, as though honor were a hazard to be avoided. Such men keep their own counsel — and oft their own privileges — as carefully as any golfer guarding his place upon the green, mindful that displeasing a powerful patron may cost him more than a stroke upon the scorecard.

##### Voicemail Closing

Yet some among our delegation chose denial, and others, having glimpsed clarity, turned from it. They guard their comforts as carefully as any golfer guarding his place upon the green, unwilling to risk the displeasure of a powerful patron. Such choices bear their own consequences.

### South Carolina Seditious Six

2020 was the year of COVID-19. State governors and secretaries of state issued emergency declarations changing the process of collecting ballots to protect public safety.

- [37 Republican Members Release Statement Ahead of Electoral College Vote / U.S. Congressman Mike Johnson](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=715). WASHINGTON. January 6 2021
- [126 Members of Congress (linked here), in which we urged the Court to immediately address the fact that four battleground states (Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin)126 Members of Congress, in which we urged the Court to immediately address the fact that four battleground states (Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin)](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/22/22O155/163550/20201211132250339_Texas%20v.%20Pennsylvania%20Amicus%20Brief%20of%20126%20Representatives%20--%20corrected.pdf)

A close read of Johnson’s statement — especially with the full page open in front of us— makes the strategy pretty clear once you strip away the constitutional framing. You’re already circling the right questions, and the context of 2020 matters enormously.

Below is a clean, structured breakdown that cuts through the rhetoric and looks at what was actually happening.

---

🧭 What Johnson and the 36 others were really arguing
The letter claims:

- Four states — Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin — “violated Article II” because non‑legislative officials changed election procedures during COVID‑19.
- Therefore, the electors from those states were “unconstitutional” and Congress should object to counting them.
- They cite Bush v. Gore and McPherson v. Blacker to argue that only legislatures can change election rules.

This is the Independent State Legislature theory in its early, pre‑2022 form.

But the key thing is what they don’t say.

---

🦠 COVID‑19 and emergency powers: what actually happened
In 2020:

- Governors, secretaries of state, and courts did adjust election procedures — mostly to expand access during a pandemic.
- These changes included:
  - Expanded absentee eligibility
  - Ballot drop boxes
  - Adjusted deadlines
  - Modified signature‑matching rules
  - Curbside voting
- These changes were made under existing state laws, emergency powers, or court orders.

Crucially:
State legislatures were not stripped of authority.
They had already delegated some powers to executive officials or courts.

Courts repeatedly upheld these changes.

---

🎯 Are they cherry‑picking states?
Short answer: yes — and the pattern is unmistakable.

The letter targets only:

- States Biden won
- States with narrow margins
- States where Trump and allies filed lawsuits
- States where legislatures were Republican‑controlled

They do not challenge:

- Texas (massive expansion of early voting by the governor)
- Florida (drop box rule changes)
- Ohio (mail voting adjustments)
- Any state Trump won where similar COVID‑related changes occurred

If the principle were truly “only legislatures can change rules,” they would have objected to all states where non‑legislative actors made adjustments.

They didn’t.

---

📉 Why these four states?
Because they were:

| State | Margin | Biden lead | Why targeted |
|-------|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Georgia | ~12k | razor-thin | GOP legislature, heavy litigation |
| Arizona | ~10k | razor-thin | Not targeted in this letter, interestingly |
| Wisconsin | ~20k | narrow | GOP legislature, court fights |
| Pennsylvania | ~80k | contested mail ballot rules | GOP legislature |
| Michigan | ~154k | not close | but symbolically important |

The pattern is not legal — it’s electoral math.

---

⚖️ Is this another Bush/Gore scenario?
Not really.

Bush v. Gore was about:

- A single state
- A single recount
- A margin of 537 votes
- A dispute over how to count ballots

2020 was:

- Multi‑state
- Multi‑month litigation
- Margins in the tens of thousands
- No evidence of fraud found by courts
- Dozens of lawsuits dismissed
- No recounts changing outcomes

Johnson’s letter tries to borrow the language of Bush v. Gore, but the factual situation is nowhere near comparable.

---

🧩 What the letter is doing rhetorically
It blends three moves:

1. Legal framing
Using constitutional language to give weight to a political objection.

2. Selective outrage
Focusing only on states where changing the outcome was mathematically possible.

3. Delegitimization through doubt
Claiming “unprecedented allegations” and “grave concerns” without asserting fraud directly — a way to justify objections without evidence.

---

🔍 The deeper pattern
You’ve been building a ledger of civic courage and institutional failure. This letter is a prime example of the latter: a document that uses constitutional language as a veneer for a targeted political strategy.

If you want, we can go line‑by‑line through the letter and annotate:

- What is legally accurate
- What is misleading
- What is omitted
- What is strategically framed

It would fit beautifully into your Hall of Shame module — especially as a companion to the Seditious Six entries.

Hello, my name is Ralph Hightower, a constituent from Chapin, South Carolina. I'm calling to offer wisdom from one of our founding fathers.

“Good morrow to you.
I call upon you as a Citizen mindful of the Republic’s welfare.

The old Almanacks teach that ‘He who helps lay the tinder must not marvel when sparks take flight.’

Though you and your fellow Attorneys General did condemn the riotous Tumult of the Sixth of January, your earlier decision to lend your name to a Petition beseeching the High Court to cast aside the certified Choice of Pennsylvania remains a matter of public Record.

A Republic is upheld not by Fury nor by Force, but by the steady Hand that honors lawful Elections and the Peaceful Transfer of Power.

Therefore I entreat you, as a Man of Station, to affirm plainly that our Elections are rightful, that Violence hath no place in our Commonwealth, and that the orderly Passage of Authority is the surest Guardian of our Liberty.

For as Poor Richard might remind us:
‘A man may wash his hands after the blaze, yet the smell of smoke lingers on the coat he wore to the kindling.’”

🕯️ Prologue for Your January 6 History Lesson

“He that lieth down with dogs shall rise up with fleas.” — Poor Richard’s Almanack

In this, the two‑hundred and fiftieth year of our Republic, we recall the old wisdom of our forebears: that danger oft declareth itself long before it arriveth at the door. One if by land, two if by sea — the signal lanterns of a people resolved to keep watch.

So too in our own age were warnings given, plain as any lantern in the steeple. Each man knew his duty; each made his choice; each hath made his bed. And as the dawn broke upon the sixth day of January, the consequences rose with them, clinging as surely as the fleas to the sleeper who lieth down in folly.

For a Republic endureth not by accident, but by the courage of those who choose country over faction, truth over comfort, and memory over convenient forgetfulness.

+: Whereas Congressman Wilson and Senator Scott are election deniers, Senator Graham had a moment of clarity, and then developed J6 Amnesia.

🕯️ Complicity and Clarity

In every age, there are those who see the danger plain and speak it, and those who, seeing the same, choose silence for the sake of favor. Thus hath it ever been in the councils of men.

Some, in the months before the tumult, lent their voices to falsehood, stirring the embers that would kindle the flame. Their complicity lieth not in the hour of the riot alone, but in the long season of indulgence that preceded it. For he who winketh at mischief becometh partner to its deed.

Others, though perceiving the peril, sought refuge in ambiguity, hoping that caution might shield them from consequence. Yet clarity delayed is clarity denied, and the Republic hath little use for those who would speak truth only when it costeth them nothing.

And there were a few — too few — who beheld the gathering storm and declared it for what it was. Their clarity stood as a lantern in the night, though many chose to avert their eyes.

Thus the day revealed each man’s measure: who upheld his oath, who bartered it away, and who, having glimpsed the truth, sought thereafter to forget it. Complicity hath many fathers; clarity but a handful of heirs.
