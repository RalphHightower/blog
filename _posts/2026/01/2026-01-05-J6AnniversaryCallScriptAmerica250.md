title: "Call Scripts For January 6 Anniversary In the 18th Century Language of Poor Richard’s Almanack (Ben Franklin)"
---

With this year being the 250<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of the founding of the United States of America, I wanted to instill an 18<sup>th</sup> century vibe, using the wisdom of Ben Franklin's *"Poor Richard’s Almanack"* to my South Carolina delegation in Washington, DC.

[Senator Lindsey Graham (T-SC)](https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/) had a brief moment of clarity after order was restored in [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/), but soon after developed J6 Amnesia. [Wilson (T-SC2)](https://joewilson.house.gov/) and [Scott (T-SC)](https://www.scott.senate.gov/) never achieved clarity of mind. 

There was another person, this one based in Columbia, South Carolina, that helped fan the flames of insurrection, [South Carolina](https://www.sc.gov/) [Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/), [Alan Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general/), son of [Joe "You Lie" Wilson](https://joewilson.house.gov/). [Alan](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general/) is also an election denier. He joined an amicus curiae with other states attorneys general seeking to throw out Pennsylvania election results. As such, he was not only complicitant in the election denial, but he was also an active participant.

Hello, my name is Ralph Hightower, a constituent from Chapin, South Carolina. I'm calling to offer wisdom from one of our founding fathers.

“He that lieth down with dogs shall rise up with fleas.” — Poor Richard’s Almanack

In this, the two‑hundred and fiftieth year of our Republic, we recall the old wisdom of our forebears: that danger oft declareth itself long before it arriveth at the door. One if by land, two if by sea — the signal lanterns of a people resolved to keep watch.

So too in our own age were warnings given, plain as any lantern in the steeple. Each man knew his duty; each made his choice; each hath made his bed. And as the dawn broke upon the sixth day of January, the consequences rose with them, clinging as surely as the fleas to the sleeper who lieth down in folly.

For a Republic endureth not by accident, but by the courage of those who choose country over faction, truth over comfort, and memory over convenient forgetfulness.

##### Live Staffer Closing

And yet, among our delegation, some did forsake that courage. Some denied the lawful count outright; others, having spoken truth for but a fleeting moment, did swiftly retreat from it, as though honor were a hazard to be avoided. Such men keep their own counsel — and oft their own privileges — as carefully as any golfer guarding his place upon the green, mindful that displeasing a powerful patron may cost him more than a stroke upon the scorecard.

##### Voicemail Closing

Yet some among our delegation chose denial, and others, having glimpsed clarity, turned from it. They guard their comforts as carefully as any golfer guarding his place upon the green, unwilling to risk the displeasure of a powerful patron. Such choices bear their own consequences.

Hello, my name is Ralph Hightower, a constituent from Chapin, South Carolina. I'm calling to offer wisdom from one of our founding fathers.

“Good morrow to you.
I call upon you as a Citizen mindful of the Republic’s welfare.

The old Almanacks teach that ‘He who helps lay the tinder must not marvel when sparks take flight.’

Though you and your fellow Attorneys General did condemn the riotous Tumult of the Sixth of January, your earlier decision to lend your name to a Petition beseeching the High Court to cast aside the certified Choice of Pennsylvania remains a matter of public Record.

A Republic is upheld not by Fury nor by Force, but by the steady Hand that honors lawful Elections and the Peaceful Transfer of Power.

Therefore I entreat you, as a Man of Station, to affirm plainly that our Elections are rightful, that Violence hath no place in our Commonwealth, and that the orderly Passage of Authority is the surest Guardian of our Liberty.

For as Poor Richard might remind us:
‘A man may wash his hands after the blaze, yet the smell of smoke lingers on the coat he wore to the kindling.’”

🕯️ Prologue for Your January 6 History Lesson

“He that lieth down with dogs shall rise up with fleas.” — Poor Richard’s Almanack

In this, the two‑hundred and fiftieth year of our Republic, we recall the old wisdom of our forebears: that danger oft declareth itself long before it arriveth at the door. One if by land, two if by sea — the signal lanterns of a people resolved to keep watch.

So too in our own age were warnings given, plain as any lantern in the steeple. Each man knew his duty; each made his choice; each hath made his bed. And as the dawn broke upon the sixth day of January, the consequences rose with them, clinging as surely as the fleas to the sleeper who lieth down in folly.

For a Republic endureth not by accident, but by the courage of those who choose country over faction, truth over comfort, and memory over convenient forgetfulness.

+: Whereas Congressman Wilson and Senator Scott are election deniers, Senator Graham had a moment of clarity, and then developed J6 Amnesia.

🕯️ Complicity and Clarity

In every age, there are those who see the danger plain and speak it, and those who, seeing the same, choose silence for the sake of favor. Thus hath it ever been in the councils of men.

Some, in the months before the tumult, lent their voices to falsehood, stirring the embers that would kindle the flame. Their complicity lieth not in the hour of the riot alone, but in the long season of indulgence that preceded it. For he who winketh at mischief becometh partner to its deed.

Others, though perceiving the peril, sought refuge in ambiguity, hoping that caution might shield them from consequence. Yet clarity delayed is clarity denied, and the Republic hath little use for those who would speak truth only when it costeth them nothing.

And there were a few — too few — who beheld the gathering storm and declared it for what it was. Their clarity stood as a lantern in the night, though many chose to avert their eyes.

Thus the day revealed each man’s measure: who upheld his oath, who bartered it away, and who, having glimpsed the truth, sought thereafter to forget it. Complicity hath many fathers; clarity but a handful of heirs.
