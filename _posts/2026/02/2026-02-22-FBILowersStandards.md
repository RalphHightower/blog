title: "The FBI Lowers Its Standards For Agents"
---

The [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) wouldn't have to lower standards if [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) hadn't fired the agents that investigated [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) in his first term, the election interference case, the insurrection, and the classified documents that he stole and actively  hid at [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/).

## [FBI reportedly lowers standards for agents, adding to an unfortunate pattern](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/fbi-reportedly-lowers-standards-for-agents-adding-to-an-unfortunate-pattern)

_[Trumpism](https;//www.donaldjtrump.com/) is defined in large part by a lowering of standards. The bureau is apparently just keeping up._

The [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) has changed in a great many ways since former podcast personality [Kash Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) became its director exactly one year ago this week, and the list of changes is still growing. [Reuters reported](https://www.reuters.com/world/fbi-plans-reduce-vetting-some-applying-be-agents-sources-say-2026-02-19/):

> _The [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) plans to make it easier for existing employees to become agents, removing two long-standing steps in vetting applicants as the bureau faces a staffing crunch under [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/), according to two people familiar with the move._

[FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Director Kash Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) is expected to eliminate a requirement that support staff already working in the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) who apply to become special agents sit for an interview and complete a writing assessment.

The [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/) report, which has not been independently verified by [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/), was based on two sources, including Jeff Crocker, a retired [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) supervisory special agent, who vetted special agent applicants during his more than 20-year career in the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/). As Crocker described it, under the new model, existing employees who pass a written exam through an online portal would be able to go directly to the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [academy](https://www.fletc.gov/) in [Quantico](https://www.townofquantico.org/), [Virginia](https://www.virginia.gov/), to train as a new agent.

An [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) spokesperson did not dispute that the process would be changed, although he denied that the bureau was lowering its standards. [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/)’ sources said the opposite.

“The consequences of allowing such individuals lacking the impressive and necessary resumes to become [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) agents simply by passing a web-based test will be both seismic and generationally harmful to the republic,” Crocker said.

Complicating matters is the familiarity of the circumstances. It was last summer, for example, when the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) [also lowered its standards](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/08/ice-recruitment-immigration-enforcement-billions/684000/) for those seeking to work as agents at [Immigration and Customs Enforcement](https://www.ice.gov/).

Around the same time, the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) [also lowered](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/trump-eases-rules-hiring-temporary-immigration-judges-rcna227711) [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) standards on the qualifications to serve as immigration judges.

Indeed, by some measures, the entirety of the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) presidency has been a grand experiment in what happens when a nation lowers its standards.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) informally lowered the standards for what it takes [to lead the FBI](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/dan-bongino-his-fbi-leadership-post-and-a-failed-experiment-in-amateurism), and what it takes [to serve in the Cabinet](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/health-secretary-rfk-jr-reflects-on-his-past-i-used-to-snort-cocaine-off-of-toilet-seats), and what it takes [to serve as a U.S. attorney](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-house-lawyer-takes-key-prosecutors-office-scandalous-circumstanc-rcna233233), and what it takes [to be a success in the private sector](https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/10/donald-trumps-first-30-years-business-failures-and-bailouts-dad/) and what it takes [to serve as vice president](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-vance-create-republican-ticket-rooted-inexperience-rcna162081).

The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) himself was, in the recent past, a television game-show host who didn’t know anything about governing, who never served a day in any public post and who arguably had no business running to serve as the chief executive of the world’s preeminent superpower.

[Trumpism](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), in other words, is defined in large part by a lowering of standards. The [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) is apparently just keeping up.
