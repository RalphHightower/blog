## [Judge Cannon blocks release of Jack Smith’s classified documents report](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/judge-cannon-blocks-release-of-jack-smiths-classified-documents-report)

_The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) appointee had previously dismissed the criminal case against [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) on the grounds that the special counsel was unlawfully appointed._

In her latest move benefiting [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), [U.S. District](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/) [Judge Aileen Cannon](https://www.ms.now/opinion/msnbc-opinion/aileen-cannon-vol-2-jack-smith-report-rcna188060) granted a request from him and his former co-defendants to block the release of [Jack Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith)’s report on the classified documents case he brought against them in [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/).

[Cannon](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/content/judge-aileen-m-cannon) had [dismissed the case](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/aileen-cannon-dismisses-trump-classified-documents-case-rcna161879) in 2024 when [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was running for [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). The [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) was appealing her order, but dropped the appeal when he won the election, due to the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/)’s policy against prosecuting sitting [presidents](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).

Explaining her reasoning on Monday, the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-appointed judge [wrote](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.648653/gov.uscourts.flsd.648653.779.0_1.pdf), in part, that “there is the matter of manifest injustice to the former defendants that would result from disclosure of Volume II. [Special Counsel Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith), acting without lawful authority, obtained an indictment in this action and initiated proceedings that resulted in a final order of dismissal of all charges.”

Volume I, [Smith](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco-smith)’s report on the other case he brought against [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), regarding the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf), [was previously released](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/jack-smith-didnt-charge-donald-trump-insurrection-rcna187578) before [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) took office again. Outside groups are [pressing for the release of the documents report](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/aileen-cannon-trump-jack-smith-documents-review) in a pending appeal.

In her order on Monday, [Cannon](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/content/judge-aileen-m-cannon) also rejected a defense request to order the report’s destruction.

In the criminal case that she dismissed in 2024, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was accused of illegally retaining national defense information as well as obstruction. He had pleaded not guilty in the case that never went to trial. Only one of his four criminal cases went to trial, the [so-called hush money case in New York]({% link NewYork34GuiltyVerdicts.md %}), in which he was convicted and [is appealing](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-appeals-hush-money-conviction-citing-supreme-court-immunity-case-rcna240294).

[Cannon](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/content/judge-aileen-m-cannon)’s dismissal capped off a series of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-friendly moves in the criminal case, and her actions (and inactions) in litigation over the report since then have also benefited the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) who appointed her, the latest example coming Monday.

When the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) dropped the documents case appeal against [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) after he won the [2024 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/2024presgeresults.pdf), the appeal was still active against his two co-defendants, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira. [Cannon](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/content/judge-aileen-m-cannon) had cited the still-pending appeal as a reason to keep the report secret. But after [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) took office, the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) [dropped the appeal](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-classified-documents-nauta-de-oliveira-doj-rcna189819) against them, thus removing that rationale for secrecy (and preventing the appeals court from ruling on whether [Cannon](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/content/judge-aileen-m-cannon) was correct to dismiss the case on unlawful appointment grounds).

The outside groups that are pressing the appeal over the report, [American Oversight](https://americanoversight.org/) and the [Knight First Amendment Institute](https://knightcolumbia.org/), had sought to intervene in the case. It took [Cannon](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/content/judge-aileen-m-cannon) so long to rule on their attempt to intervene that the federal appeals court with jurisdiction over [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/) said in November that she had engaged in [“undue delay”](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/judge-cannon-jack-smith-report-trump-undue-delay-rcna241707) and ordered her to rule. When she finally did so in December, [she acknowledged](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.648653/gov.uscourts.flsd.648653.761.0.pdf) that the case was no longer pending against the co-defendants – thus removing her previous rationale for keeping the report secret – but she still gave the parties an opportunity to seek  “appropriate relief.”

In response to that invitation, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [filed a motion](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.648653/gov.uscourts.flsd.648653.772.0.pdf) through a personal lawyer asking [Cannon](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/content/judge-aileen-m-cannon) to permanently block the release of the report, and the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) [lodged its own court filing](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.648653/gov.uscourts.flsd.648653.773.0_3.pdf) saying that it agrees that the report shouldn’t be released outside the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/). Nauta and De Oliveira went even further in [seeking an order](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26904742/jan-30-2026-united-states-of-america-v-trump-nauta-and-de-oliveira-expedited-motion.pdf) from [Cannon](https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/content/judge-aileen-m-cannon) that all copies of the report be destroyed, which she rejected on Monday while granting the motion to block its release. 

Her order specified that [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) “or her successor(s), the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/), its officers, agents, officials, and employees, and all persons acting in active concert or participation with such individuals, are enjoined from (a) releasing, sharing, or transmitting Volume II of the Final Report or any drafts of Volume II outside the Department of Justice, or (b) otherwise releasing, distributing, conveying, or sharing with anyone outside the Department of Justice any information or conclusions in Volume II or in drafts thereof.”
