It was a government trip, you say? You had some meetings scheduled with law enforcement and security?

As David Addison of the [ABC](https://abc.go.com/) sitcom, Moonlighting, would say, **"What a coinky-dink?"**

[Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) has to reimburse the government up to the cost of a commercial flight? A commercial flight is far less expensive than the \$75,000 that it took to fly the [Gulfstream](https://www.gulfstream.com/).

_The [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director has plans to watch the U.S. men’s hockey team vie for gold, sources tell [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/)._

By [Carol Leonnig](https://www.ms.now/author/carol-leonnig) and [Ken Dilanian](https://www.ms.now/author/ken-dilanian-2)

[FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Director Kash Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) flew today on the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/)’s [Gulfstream jet](https://www.gulfstream.com/) bound for a trip to the [winter Olympics in Italy](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026) to watch one of his favorite sports: men’s ice hockey, according to three people familiar with his plans.

[Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel), an avid hockey player and fan, will be at the [Olympic festivities](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026) and plans to attend the [bronze medal](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/iho/m/team6-------------/fnl-/000200--/team-playbyplay) competition in men’s ice hockey on Saturday and the competition for the [gold medal](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/iho/m/team6-------------/fnl-/000100--/team-playbyplay) on Sunday, the people said.

An [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) official confirmed [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s travel plans, but said he has several official government purposes for attending, including a meeting with an ambassador, briefings on [Olympics](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026) security and other government meetings.

[Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s travel to [Italy](https://www.governo.it/) was reported Thursday afternoon by [CBS](https://www.cbsnews.com/).

Government accounts estimate it costs U.S. taxpayers at least \$5,000 per flight hour for the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Gulfstream](https://www.gulfstream.com/en/aircraft/gulfstream-g500/) to fly, meaning [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s trip to [Milan](https://www.comune.milano.it/) is likely to cost as much as \$75,000.

[FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) spokesperson [Ben Williamson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-williamson-b6926580/) [tweeted late Thursday](https://x.com/_WilliamsonBen/status/2024605212858630465) that [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s trip was not personal and he was invited months ago.

“The [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) also has a major role in [Olympic](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026) security – as we do with the World Cup, F1, and more – so we have a U.S. consulate briefing on [Olympic](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026) security and current [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) posture, as well as thanking [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) personnel on the ground,” [Williamson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-williamson-b6926580/) wrote.

As director, [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) is required to fly on the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) jet for his travel in order to ensure he’s able to quickly return to [Washington](https://dc.gov/) in an emergency, or be available for secure communications during a crisis involving a mass casualty event or national security threat. He is also required to reimburse the taxpayers for personal travel up to the cost of a commercial flight.

The [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) official said [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) would reimburse the government for any portion of his travel that may be personal, but emphasized he is going to [Italy](https://www.governo.it/) for government business.

The last known instance of an [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director traveling to an [Olympics](https://www.olympics.com/) setting was in November 2003, when then-Director [Robert Mueller went to Greece](https://www.foxnews.com/story/fbi-director-to-review-greek-security-for-olympics) for a two-day visit. But [Mueller](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/robert-s-mueller-iii) made his trip eight months before the [Olympic](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026) events to review security preparations for the upcoming Summer [Olympics](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026) there.
