Feb 6, 2026  [#DailyShow](https://www.cc.com/fan-hub/the-daily-show) [#SuperBowlLIX](https://www.nfl.com/super-bowl/event-info/) [#Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)
Desi Lydic unpacks [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s long-term beef with the [NFL](https://www.nfl.com/) over reduced violence, racist name reversals, halftime performers, and the pageantry of the kickoff. After rejecting [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s advances to buy the Buffalo Bills, a 2014 conversation with Stephen A. Smith begs the difficult question: Is the [NFL](https://www.nfl.com/) responsible for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s presidency?
