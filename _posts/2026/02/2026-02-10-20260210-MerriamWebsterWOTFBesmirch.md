[See the entry](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/besmirch) >


My example:
February 10, 2026 was a [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Homeland Security Committee](https://homeland.house.gov/) meeting on the [Oversight of the Department of Homeland Security: ICE CBP and USCIS](https://homeland.house.gov/hearing/oversight-of-the-department-of-homeland-security-ice-cbp-and-uscis/) at 10:00 AM.

WITNESSES:

Mr. [Todd Lyons](https://www.ice.gov/leadership)
Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Director, [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)](https://www.ice.gov/), [DHS](https://www.dhs.gov/)

The Honorable [Rodney Scott](https://www.cbp.gov/about/leadership-organization/commissioners-office/commissioner)
Commissioner, [U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)](https://www.cbp.gov/), [DHS](https://www.dhs.gov/)

The Honorable [Joseph Edlow](https://www.uscis.gov/about-us/organization/leadership/joseph-b-edlow-director-us-citizenship-and-immigration-services)
Director, [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)](https://www.usci8s.gov/), [DHS](https://www.dhs.gov/)

Representative [Sheri Biggs (T-SC3)](https://sheribiggs.house.gov/) in a fawning manner congratulations to [CBP] for securing the border calling [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) the [Trumpian](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) trope, _"theRadical Left"_.

- [Sheri Biggs (T-SC3)](https://sheribiggs.house.gov/) 
    - [(202) 225-5301 DC Office](tel:+1202225-5301)
    - [(864) 224-7401 Anderson District. Office](tel:+18642247401)

My call script to [Sheri Biggs (T-SC3)](https://sheribiggs.house.gov/)

> “Hi, this is Ralph Hightower calling from the Second District of South Carolina.<br /><br />I’m calling about Representative Biggs’ use of the phrase ‘the radical left’ during today’s hearing. I want her office to know that comments like that don’t describe me — they besmirch Americans who care about due process, constitutional guardrails, and responsible oversight.<br /><br />I spent years as an independent voter. I became a Democrat because I watched one party walk away from institutional integrity. That isn’t radical. That’s civic responsibility.<br /><br />I follow these hearings because I want facts, professionalism, and accountability — not slogans or scapegoating. I’m asking Representative Biggs to choose accuracy and respect in her public statements.<br /><br />Thank you for passing this along.”

The prefix be- has several applications in English; in the case of besmirch, it means "to make or cause to be." But what does smirch itself mean? Since the 1400s, smirch has been used as a verb meaning "to make dirty, stained, or discolored." Besmirch joined English in the early 1600s, and today smirch and besmirch are both used when something—and especially something abstract, like a reputation—is being figuratively sullied, i.e., damaged or harmed. Besmirch isn't unique in its journey; English has a history of attaching be- to existing verbs to form synonyms. For example, befriend combines be- in its "to make or cause to be" sense with the verb friend, meaning "to act as the friend of." Befuddle combines be- in its "thoroughly" sense with fuddle, meaning "to stupefy with or as if with drink." And befog combines be- in its "to provide or cover with" sense with fog, meaning "to cover with or as if with fog."
