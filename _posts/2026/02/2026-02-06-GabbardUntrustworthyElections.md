## [Tulsi Gabbard can’t be trusted with investigating elections](https://www.ms.now/opinion/tulsi-gabbard-trump-elections-georgia-fulton-county)

_The [Director of National Intelligence](https://www.dni.gov/) is doing her part to reboot her boss’ false claims of election fraud in the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf)._

Feb. 6, 2026, 6:00 AM EST
By [Philip Bump](https://www.ms.now/author/philip-bump)

[President Donald Trump’s post last Thursday](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115978022925817001) began with two siren emojis.

“BREAKING,” it said. “[Director of National Intelligence](https://www.dni.gov/) [Tulsi Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) has just released HUNDREDS OF BOMBSHELL RUSSIAGATE DOCUMENTS proving that [Barack Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) personally ordered [CIA](https://www.cia.gov/) agents to manufacture false intelligence on [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).”

“This was a coup attempt by [Barack Hussein Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) and his cronies,” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s post stated, concluding with, “ARREST OBAMA NOW!” An attached video excerpted a report from [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com%)’ [Jesse Watters](https://www.foxnews.com/person/w/jesse-watters) delineating comments [Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) made at the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). 

This made a splash on the right. The conspiracy-centered site [Gateway Pundit ran a story](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2026/01/tulsi-gabbard-releases-documents-that-prove-it-was/) about the documents released by [Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) the prior day, which the article claimed proved “[Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) doctored the information to make it look like Putin and his buddy [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) stole the election.”

Given the sources — [Watters](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/09/fox-biden-economy/), [Gateway Pundit](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/12/21/another-good-example-how-laughably-flimsy-trumps-fraud-claims-are/) — you will not be surprised to learn that this accusation isn’t true. In fact, it wasn’t even new. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s post was an image, not actual text, because he’d lifted it from [a December X post](https://x.com/JoshHall2024/status/2001694999331680612). But even in December, this wasn’t “BREAKING.” As you can see on the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) website itself, [Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence)’s announcement [had taken place in July](https://www.whitehouse.gov/videos/dni-director-tulsi-gabbard-on-the-russia-hoax-there-is-irrefutable-evidence/). [Watters](https://www.foxnews.com/person/w/jesse-watters)’ report was [from that same month](https://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20250724_050000_Jesse_Watters_Primetime/start/120/end/180). [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was just … sharing it again, in someone else’s words.

This incident is important not only because the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) of the United States is sharing six-month-old claims as though they are new. It is important because the allegation [Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) made in July shows her willingness to elevate dubious evidence in order to make a loaded political claim — something to bear in mind given her new role “investigating” the “election fraud” that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) insists occurred in the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf).

What [Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) presented last July was cherry-picked information from emails sent around the [2016 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf). One quote from an email that was [included in her press release](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/press-releases-2025/4086-pr-15-25) about this sweeping conspiracy, for example, suggested that analysts knew [Russia](http://government.ru/) was “probably not trying … to influence the election by using cyber means.” But [that quote continued](https://www.odni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/DIG/DIG-Declassified-Evidence-Obama-Subvert-President-Trump-2016-Victory-Election-July2025.pdf): “to manipulate computer-enabled election infrastructure.” In other words, the analysis was that [Russia](http://government.ru/) wasn’t hacking voting machines but — in the next sentence! — warned that “[Russia](http://government.ru/) probably is using cyber means primarily to influence the election by stealing campaign party data and leaking select items, and it is also using public propaganda.”

But [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wanted to hear that the [Russia](http://government.ru/) investigation was a hoax, so much so that he’d amplify months-old news last week. So [Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) told [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) what he wanted to hear.

[Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) said that she was in [Fulton County](https://fultonvountyga.gov/) because her “presence was requested by the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and executed under my broad statutory authority to coordinate, integrate, and analyze intelligence related to election security.” 

The day before [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) revisited [Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence)’s July claim, the director of national intelligence was in [Georgia](https://www.georgia.gov/), joining [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) agents as they seized material from an elections office in [Fulton County](https://fultonvountyga.gov/). The county that’s home to the majority of [Atlanta](https://www.atlantaga.gov/)’s population has been a target of [Trumpworld](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) conspiracy theorizing since [immediately after the election](https://www.gpb.org/news/2020/12/04/fact-checking-rudy-giulianis-grandiose-georgia-election-fraud-claim) five-plus years ago. There’s no reason to think that any fraud occurred there — [two recounts and analysis of voting patterns](https://www.pbump.net/o/some-things-you-should-know-about-fulton-county-georgia/) make clear that its [2020 results](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf) were unremarkable — but here, too, there’s a story [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wants to hear and [Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) seems willing to tell it.

The [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/) [reported on Gabbard’s new remit](https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/spy-chief-tulsi-gabbard-is-hunting-for-2020-election-fraud-07ea2383) last week.

“[Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) is leading the administration’s effort to re-examine the election and look for potential crimes, a priority for the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/),” according to [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) officials who spoke with the paper. As part of that effort, she has “consulted with others in the intelligence community about claims of foreign interference in the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf).”

Now we get into even weirder territory. In November, [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/21/trump-doj-venezuela-2020-election), citing four sources, reported that the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/), working with the U.S. attorney in [Puerto Rico](https://www.pr.gov/), was trying to figure out if [Venezuela](https://gob.ve/) somehow contributed to illegal voting in the [2020 contest](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf). On Wednesday, [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/) cited three sources who said  [Gabbard had investigated](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-spy-chiefs-office-investigated-voting-machines-puerto-rico-2026-02-04/) voting machines in [Puerto Rico](https://www.pr.gov/) as well ([Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence)’s office confirmed the report).

In a statement to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/), [Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence)’s office claimed that their only target was possible vulnerabilities in the territory’s election results. But a baseless allegation that [Venezuela](https://gob.ve/) had been involved in stealing the election emerged shortly after the [2020 contest](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf). Promoted by [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s attorneys [Sidney Powell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sidney-powell-90b35a24/) and Rudy Giuliani, it held that the company [Smartmatic]() had been created to help [Venezuelan](https://gob.ve/) leaders steal elections — and was now being deployed in the U.S. It was [almost immediately debunked](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/technology/sidney-powell-venezuela.html).

When [Venezuelan](https://gob.ve/) [president Nicolás Maduro](https://presidencia.gob.ve/Site/Web/Principal/paginas/classPresidente.php) was seized by American forces in January, right-wing observers [immediately resurrected the idea](https://www.ms.now/news/trump-venezuela-maga-election-conspiracy-theory), suggesting that his arrest was linked to [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf) investigations. But, again, there’s no demonstrable line from [Venezuela](https://gob.ve/) to U.S. election results through voting machines or software, and any assertion to the contrary should be viewed with deep skepticism — particularly when coming from [Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence), given her track record.

Soon after taking office, [she made clear](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/press-releases-2025/4063-pr-05-25) digging up evidence to backstop right-wing conspiracy theories (about Covid, about [Russia](http://government.ru/), about “weaponization” of government) would be a focus. She’s starting from conclusions and seeking evidence to support them, which is the inverse of how intelligence work is meant to go.

She and the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) aren’t even being honest about why she was in [Georgia](https://www.georgia.gov/). [In a letter she sent](https://www.axios.com/2026/02/03/gabbard-trump-request-fbi-elections-raid-georgia) to the top Democrats on the [House](https://intelligence.house.gov/) and [Senate](http://www.intelligence.senate.gov/) intelligence committees, [Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) said she was in [Fulton County](https://fultonvountyga.gov/) because her “presence was requested by the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and executed under my broad statutory authority to coordinate, integrate, and analyze intelligence related to election security.” 

When [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was [asked by NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-interview-nbc-news-extend-transcript-tom-llamas-super-bowl-2026-rcna257410) why [Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) was there, he said, “I don’t know.” But, he added, “you know — a lot of the cheating comes from — it’s — it’s international cheating.”

There are two obvious reasons that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and [Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) are focused on generating claims about the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf).

First, there’s [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s vanity. That he bristles at having lost the popular vote in [2016](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf) and the presidency in [2020](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf) has long been obvious, but he made it explicit during comments at the [National Prayer Breakfast](https://npbfoundation.com/) on Thursday.

“They rigged the second election. I had to win it. Had to win it. I needed it for my own ego,” [he said](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3me4kr7pr5v2y). “I would’ve had a bad ego for the rest of my life. Now I really have a big ego.”

More importantly, though, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and his allies are already using these tired, debunked, baseless claims of election fraud and interference to advocate for tighter federal control of the voting process. Speaking to former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) deputy director turned [podcaster](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-dan-bongino-show/id965293227) [Dan Bongino](https://open.spotify.com/show/4sftHO603JaFqpuQBEZReL) earlier this week, [Trump suggested that Republicans nationalize elections](https://www.ms.now/opinion/dan-bongino-trump-podcast-fbi) — that is, have the government he controls assume control over the intentionally decentralized process for voting that currently exists. 

[NBC](https://www.nbcnews.com/)’s [Tom Llamas](https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/biography/tom-llamas-nbc-nightly-news-anchor-rcna209845) asked about that, too, prompting [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to complain that “there are some areas that are unbelievably corrupt.” He pointed to cities such as [Detroit](https://detroitmi.gov/), [Philadelphia](https://www.phila.gov/) and [Atlanta](https://www.atlantaga.gov/) where he actually improved in [2024](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/2024presgeresults.pdf) relative to [2020](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf).

“Will you trust the results of the midterms if Republicans lose control of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/)?” [Llamas](https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/biography/tom-llamas-nbc-nightly-news-anchor-rcna209845) asked.

“I will if the elections are honest,” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) replied. 

Meanwhile, he and [Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) are actively looking for ways to suggest that they won’t be. Be prepared for more pronouncements from [Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) like the one last July, assertions about election fraud or [Venezuelan](https://gob.ve/) wrongdoing or who-knows-what, claims that crumble on the slightest scrutiny but which become staples of [Trumpworld](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) rhetoric.

And then look for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to repeat those claims on a random Thursday six months later.
