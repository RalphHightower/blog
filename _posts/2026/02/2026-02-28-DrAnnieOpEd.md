## [I’m a South Carolina pediatrician. This measles outbreak was preventable.](https://www.ms.now/opinion/measles-vaccines-south-carolina-rfk-jr)

_I’m a pediatrician — and a [measles](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/index.htm) outbreak is surging in my home state of [South Carolina](https://www.sc.gov/). This was all preventable, and we need to be honest about how we got here._

May 29, 2025

I’ve been a pediatrician for 20 years. When I learned how to take a pediatric patient’s history, I was taught to ask parents: “Are your child’s immunizations up to date?” At the beginning of my career I’d already be writing down the answer “yes,” without hesitation or uncertainty. Now when I ask that question, I brace myself.

Right now, a [measles](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/index.htm) outbreak is surging in my home state of [South Carolina](https://www.sc.gov/), where there are [already more than 900 confirmed cases](https://dph.sc.gov/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/measles-rubeola/2025-measles-outbreak), most of them unvaccinated children, with hundreds in quarantine and more exposures being reported daily.

That’s hundreds of parents missing work. Kids missing weeks of school. Newborns, seniors and the immunocompromised being forced to gamble their health on their neighbors’ choices. Hospitals and health centers bracing for what comes next.

This was all preventable, and we need to be honest about how we got here.

We have an [incredibly safe and effective vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/index.html) for [measles](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/index.htm). One of the reasons scientists worked with urgency to develop the [measles](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/index.htm) [vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/index.html) was because of how contagious the virus is, far more contagious than the [flu](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/index.html) or [Covid-19](https://www.cdc.gov/covid/index.html). Every person with [measles](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/index.htm) infects 20 other people, on average. Someone with [measles](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/index.htm) can walk into a room, cough and leave, and the virus can still be alive in that room for hours. This is why [measles](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/index.htm) doesn’t “fade out” on its own. It spreads like wildfire when community immunity drops.

So no, [measles](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/index.htm) doesn’t spread like this just because a virus is good at its job. It spreads when the systems meant to protect families get replaced with noise, doubt, lies and deliberate confusion.

At the highest levels of our federal government, we have watched medical expertise get shoved aside while conspiracy theories get promoted. The message Americans keep getting is that expertise is suspect, that doubt is bravery and that your [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) feed is just as good as your doctor’s advice. When the people at the top signal that science is subjective, confusion becomes contagious.

That message has consequences. It becomes the air people breathe. It shapes what a parent believes about vaccinations as they scroll their social media feed in the preschool pickup line. It erodes trust in medicine and threatens the fabric of our nation’s public health system.

The outbreak isn’t the fault of [Health and Human Services](https://www.hhs.gov/) [Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) alone, but we’re kidding ourselves if we pretend leadership doesn’t matter. 

> **Stop letting politicians play games with public health.**

[Kennedy](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html) has been a leading voice in the anti-vaccine movement for decades, which has led communities across the country to slip below the herd immunity threshold for the prevention of outbreaks of infections like [measles](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/index.htm). Even if you replaced the name on the door at [HHS](https://www.hhs.gov/) tomorrow (which a responsible [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) would do), trust doesn’t snap back like a rubber band. It takes years to build and minutes to burn.

And the burn is not theoretical. Just this month, the United States withdrew from the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/), stepping away from the very kind of coordination that helps countries spot outbreaks early and stop them before they spread. Meanwhile, the world is looking back at us: a nation on the brink of losing elimination status for [measles](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/index.htm), a disease we fully eliminated in 2000.

We are flirting with the return of an old killer, not because the science changed, not because the virus itself changed, but because our politics did.

I didn’t set out to become a politician. I’m a pediatrician and mom of three, which means I understand deeply what it feels like to be responsible for a tiny human you’d do anything to protect. I know how heavy it is to make decisions in a world that feels more chaotic and less trustworthy by the day. And I understand that when politics is injected into public health, parents’ jobs get harder and children suffer. That is why I stepped up to fight on behalf of America’s children and the families who love them.

So here’s my plea, doctor to country, mother to community.

Stop letting politicians play games with public health. Put scientific expertise back where it belongs: in government, in policy and in the language we use when the stakes are life and death.

If you want to stop [measles](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/index.htm), you should get vaccinated.

If you want to stop the next iteration of this, you stop rewarding people who profit from confusion. You stop letting unserious leaders turn public health into a culture war. You put serious, qualified people back in the rooms where decisions are made.

[Measles](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/index.htm) doesn’t care who you voted for. It cares whether we protect each other. And we still can.

[Dr. Annie Andrews](https://drannieandrews.com/) is a pediatrician and mom who has dedicated her career to fighting for a brighter future for all children. She’s running for the [U.S. Senate](https://drannieandrews.com/) in [South Carolina](https://www.sc.gov/).
