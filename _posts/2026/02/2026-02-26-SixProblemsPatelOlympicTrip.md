## [6 problems with Kash Patel partying with the Olympic men’s hockey team](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/kash-patel-partying-with-the-olympic-mens-hockey-team)

_The [director](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) has faced months of accusations that he’s misused [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) jets for personal reasons. He just did fresh damage to his poor reputation._

By [Steve Benen](https://www.ms.now/author/steve-benen)

After the [U.S. men’s Olympic hockey team](https://teamusa.usahockey.com/2026olympicmenroster?) won a gold medal, the players and coaches celebrated in their locker room. That wasn’t surprising given the circumstances, though there was one unexpected person in the room partying with them. [MS NOW reported](https://www.ms.now/news/fbi-chief-shown-in-raucous-locker-room-celebration-during-olympics-trip):

> _[FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Director](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) [Kash Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel), during what his spokesman said was an official trip to [Milan](https://www.comune.milano.it/) for security meetings, was filmed guzzling from a beer bottle and celebrating in the locker room with [U.S. Olympic hockey players](https://teamusa.usahockey.com/2026olympicmenroster?) Sunday after they won the gold-medal game._

> _Several videos emerged on social media showing [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) in the locker room after the game, but one in particular drew outrage from current and former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) agents. It depicted [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) pouring what appeared to be beer down his throat, spraying some of it in the air and screaming in celebration as a player put a gold medal around his neck._

At first blush, some might find this unremarkable. The fact that an American hockey fan celebrated with American athletes after a big win is hardly the stuff of a political controversy.

But the details matter.

1. An earlier [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) denial isn’t holding up well. After [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/) [reported last week](https://www.ms.now/news/kash-patel-headed-to-milan-for-the-olympics-on-the-fbi-jet) that [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) was headed to [Milan](https://www.comune.milano.it/) on an [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) jet, at the expense of American taxpayers, to watch the men’s ice hockey team compete, [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) spokesperson [Ben Williamson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-williamson-b6926580/) told [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/) on Thursday that [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) was going to [Milan](https://www.comune.milano.it/) for a series of business meetings and that it was unfair to describe the trip as having to do with hockey or leisure. In fact, he [derided the reporting in a tweet](https://x.com/_WilliamsonBen/status/2025407001367335302).

While the bureau continues to insist that [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) attended some official events in [Italy](https://www.governo.it/), the videos of [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) partying with the team didn’t exactly bolster [Williamson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-williamson-b6926580/)’s denial.

2. [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) is haunted by his recent past. A few years ago, when [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) was known as little more than a conspiratorial media personality, [he publicly derided](https://bsky.app/profile/ronfilipkowski.bsky.social/post/3m4oxx2zwmc2v) then-[FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Director Christopher Wray](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/christopher-wray) for allegedly using an [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) jet for personal reasons. Oops.

3. Isn’t [Team Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) supposed to be fixated on preventing wasteful government spending? Not quite a month ago, the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) introduced a new assistant attorney general who would have all of the powers of a special counsel and would focus entirely on [uncovering examples of Americans receiving taxpayer-financed benefits](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/the-problems-with-the-white-houses-newly-announced-fraud-czar) to which they were not entitled. Any chance this office could take a closer look at [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) and his use of public resources?

4. [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) appears to have other things to do right now. [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/22/us/politics/fbi-director-patel-olympics-mar-a-lago.html) that [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) appeared to have a great time while the bureau he ostensibly leads “grappled with multiple, fast-developing crises at home,” adding, “[Mr. Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s trip to [Italy](https://www.governo.it/) came at a fraught and frenetic time for the bureau and for [Mr. Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel).”

5. The [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [director](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) made an existing problem worse. [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) has faced [months’ worth of accusations](https://www.thebulwark.com/p/kash-patel-fbi-director-private-jet-problem-nashville) that he’s [misused FBI jets for personal reasons](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/facing-difficult-questions-use-fbi-jet-kash-patel-pitches-weak-defense-rcna241658). In theory, he’d acknowledge the controversy and curtail his jet-setting habits. In practice, he’s apparently comfortable repeating the same mistake, confident that he’ll get away with it.

6. [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) isn’t doing his reputation any favors. To the extent that the beleaguered [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [director](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) wants to be seen as a serious and sober public official, worthy of broad public trust, he’s failing. In fact, as [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/)’s latest report noted, “eight former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) and [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) officials sent [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/) a copy of the video, which they said was drawing outrage as it rocketed around [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) and [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) circles.”

Perceptions of [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) as an undisciplined and unprofessional [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) chief just got worse.

In 1993, then-[FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Director William Sessions](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/william-s-sessions) was accused of, among other things, misusing [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) resources for his personal travel. This led then-[Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) Janet Reno to launch an investigation, which concluded that [Sessions](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/william-s-sessions) had shown “serious deficiencies in judgment.” [Bill Clinton](https://clintonwhitehouse2.archives.gov/) fired the director soon after.

There’s no reason to believe [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) or [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) will take a similar interest in allegations surrounding [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel). That said, the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [director](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) is supposed to serve a 10-year term, and if a future [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) were looking for a reason to show [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) the door, he or she will have plenty to work with.
