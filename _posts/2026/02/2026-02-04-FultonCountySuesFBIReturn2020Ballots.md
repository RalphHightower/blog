_Officials are challenging the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) in federal court after the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) took hundreds of boxes of election materials last week._

[Fulton County](https://fultoncountyga.gov/) officials have filed a motion in federal court seeking the return of 2020 election ballots and related materials that were seized by the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) last month.

The motion, filed in [U.S. District Court](https://www.uscourts.gov/) for the [Northern District of Georgia](https://www.gand.uscourts.gov/), challenges the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/)’s removal of thousands of original ballots, voter rolls and other election records from the county’s [Election Hub and Operation Center](https://www.fultoncountyga.gov/inside-fulton-county/fulton-county-departments/registration-and-elections/elections-contacts) near [Atlanta](https://www.atlaantaga.gov/).  The court filing also seeks to unseal the affidavit that was filed by the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) to get approval for the unannounced search.

[FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) agents [executed](https://www.ms.now/news/fbi-searching-elections-office-in-fulton-county-georgia) a search warrant on Jan. 28, seizing about 700 boxes of documents tied to the [November 2020 general election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf). [Fulton County](https://fultoncountyga.gov/) officials argue that the federal government exceeded its authority and violated legal protections for election materials.

[Fulton County](https://fultoncountyga.gov/) [Chairman Robb Pitts](https://fultoncountyga.gov/Commissioners/Robb-Pitts) said during a press conference on Wednesday that the legal battle is in its early stage and that he is unable to go into further details. The county is not publicly releasing the motion because it is still under seal. He emphasized that [Fulton County](https://fultoncountyga.gov/) is “focused right now on delivering free and fair elections in 2026 in compliance with the law,” adding, “we must do this without interference or threats of a federal takeover.”

While federal officials have characterized the action as a court-authorized law enforcement operation, county leaders and [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) lawmakers have blasted it as unprecedented and potentially harmful to trust in elections. Concerns include the absence of a formal chain-of-custody inventory when original ballots were taken by the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) and uncertainty about where and how the materials are being stored.

“We don’t know where they are. We don’t know, really, who has them. We don’t know what they’re doing with them? Are they being tampered with?” [Pitts](https://fultoncountyga.gov/Commissioners/Robb-Pitts) said.

[Fulton County](https://fultoncountyga.gov/) was central to former [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s repeated claims, without evidence, that the 2020 election in [Georgia](https://www.georgia.gov/) was rigged, and those claims have fueled ongoing controversies and legal battles.

“The [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) himself and his allies, they refused to accept the fact that they lost, and even if he had won [Georgia](https://www.georgia.gov/), he would still have lost the presidency,” [Pitts](https://fultoncountyga.gov/Commissioners/Robb-Pitts) said.

[Pitts](https://fultoncountyga.gov/Commissioners/Robb-Pitts) said he believes the investigation in [Fulton County](https://fultoncountyga.gov/) is a tactic by the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) to influence future elections.

“I think, probably this is the first step in whatever they’re going to do in order to depress voter participation, voter registration — making whatever changes they think are necessary to help their case in 2026 but more importantly in 2028,” [Pitts](https://fultoncountyga.gov/Commissioners/Robb-Pitts) said.

On Monday [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) called on the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) to “nationalize the voting” ahead of the midterm elections.

“The [Republicans](https;//www.gop.com/) should say, ‘We want to take over, we should take over the voting, the voting in at least many, 15 places.’ The [Republicans](https;//www.gop.com/) ought to nationalize the voting,” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said on a podcast with [Dan Bongino](https://open.spotify.com/show/4sftHO603JaFqpuQBEZReL), the former deputy director of the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/).
