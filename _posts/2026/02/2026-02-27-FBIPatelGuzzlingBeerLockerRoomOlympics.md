## [FBI chief shown in raucous locker room celebration during Olympics trip](https://www.ms.now/news/fbi-chief-shown-in-raucous-locker-room-celebration-during-olympics-trip)

_During what his agency said was purely a business trip, [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Director Kash Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) celebrated with the [U.S. men’s hockey team](https://teamusa.usahockey.com/2026olympicmenroster?) in [Italy](https://www.governo.it/) on Sunday._

Feb. 22, 2026, 8:43 PM EST
By [Ken Dilanian](https://www.ms.now/author/ken-dilanian-2) and [Carol Leonnig](https://www.ms.now/author/carol-leonnig)

[FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Director Kash Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel), during what his spokesman said was an official trip to [Milan](https://www.comune.milano.it/) for security meetings, was filmed guzzling from a beer bottle and celebrating in the locker room with [U.S. Olympic hockey players](https://teamusa.usahockey.com/2026olympicmenroster?) Sunday after they won the [gold-medal game](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/iho/m/team6-------------/fnl-/000100--/team-playbyplay).

Several videos emerged on social media showing [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) in the locker room after the game, but one in particular drew outrage from current and former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) agents.  It depicted [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) pouring what appeared to be beer down his throat, spraying some of it in the air and screaming in celebration as a player put a gold medal around his neck.

Eight former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) and [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) officials sent [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/) a copy of the video, which they said was drawing outrage as it rocketed around [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) and [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) circles.

[Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) is an avid hockey fan, and nothing in the videos is unusual for a post-game celebration after a victory of this magnitude. But his presence in the locker room drew attention because [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) flew to [Milan](https://www.comune.milano.it/) on the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/)’s private jet, and his spokesman denounced [reporting by MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/news/kash-patel-headed-to-milan-for-the-olympics-on-the-fbi-jet) and other outlets that he was flying to [Milan](https://www.comune.milano.it/) to watch the [men’s hockey games](https://teamusa.usahockey.com/2026olympicmenroster?) at the [Olympics](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026).

[Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) [posted to his personal X account](https://x.com/kash_patel/status/2025736412125855918?s=46) late Sunday: “For the very concerned media – yes, I love America and was extremely humbled when my friends, the [newly minted Gold Medal winners](https://teamusa.usahockey.com/2026olympicmenroster?) on [Team USA](https://www.teamusa.com/home), invited me into the locker room to celebrate this historic moment with the boys.”

[FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) spokesman [Ben Williamson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-williamson-b6926580/) told [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/) on Thursday that [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) was going to [Milan](https://www.comune.milano.it/) for a series of business meetings, and it was unfair to describe the trip as having to do with hockey or pleasure.

“Your rag outlet wrote that he went to hang out at the [Olympics](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026) on the taxpayer dime – even when provided information that your theory was false,” [Williamson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-williamson-b6926580/) posed Saturday on X. He did not respond to a request for comment about the video.

[Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) posted a photo showing him in the post-game locker room as he congratulated the U.S. team on the win.

[Williamson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-williamson-b6926580/) previously noted that [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) attended at least four “official public events” while in [Italy](https://www.governo.it/), and he [argued](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://x.com/_WilliamsonBen/status/2025354963816186298?s=20__;!!HqJSLGM!vr_ivci7r_igApIWXPrCCD3ApGfETwC302x6rl21XkxYiYFSMPs_DNo3loyOed0beFa1f7GfocA8fQ1p1p3EM9JQ8wA$) it was therefore misleading to suggest [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) traveled to [Milan](https://www.comune.milano.it/) to watch the [Olympics](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026).

In July, after the [National Hockey League](https://www.nhl.com/) announced it was allowing players to participate in the games, [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) [posted](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://x.com/Kash_Patel/status/1940689160656114026?s=20__;!!HqJSLGM!vr_ivci7r_igApIWXPrCCD3ApGfETwC302x6rl21XkxYiYFSMPs_DNo3loyOed0beFa1f7GfocA8fQ1p1p3E30sux9w$) on X: “[Team, USA](https://teamusa.usahockey.com/2026olympicmenroster?), I’ll see you there.”

As [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/) previously reported, some former agents have compared [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s decisions about personal use of [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) resources to those of [William Sessions](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/william-s-sessions), the first [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director to be fired in U.S. history.

In 1993, [President Bill Clinton](https://clintonwhitehouse2.archives.gov/) fired [Sessions](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/william-s-sessions) based on an internal investigation that found [Sessions](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/william-s-sessions) had misused [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) resources for personal trips for himself and his wife. A report documented that [Sessions](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/william-s-sessions), who was first appointed by [President George H.W. Bush]() and continued as director in the [Clinton administration](https://clintonwhitehouse2.archives.gov/), forced security agents off [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) planes and demanded they fly commercially so that his wife could accompany him at government expense.

At [Sessions](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/william-s-sessions)’ direction, the report concluded, [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) aircraft were diverted to pick up his wife in other cities, and [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) vehicles were employed to take her to get her nails done, shop and pick up firewood. The report, conducted by the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/)’s [Office of Professional Responsibility](https://www.justice.gov/opr), found that [Sessions](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/william-s-sessions) had scheduled official appointments in specific locations to justify charging the government for personal travel.
