## [Kash Patel’s use of jet delayed FBI team’s mass shooting response, whistleblower tells top senator](https://www.ms.now/news/senator-slams-kash-patel-for-use-of-fbi-jet-asks-for-investigation)

_[Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Richard Durbin](https://www.durbin.senate.gov/) says [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [director](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s “misplaced priorities” led to the delayed response to the [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/) shooting in December._

Feb. 24, 2026, 2:15 PM EST
By [Carol Leonnig](https://www.ms.now/author/carol-leonnig) and [Ken Dilanian](https://www.ms.now/author/ken-dilanian-2)

Agents with the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/)’s elite evidence response team were delayed in reaching the scene of a mass shooting at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/) in December because there was no [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) plane available to take them to [Rhode Island](https://www.ri.gov/), according to three sources and a whistleblower’s account newly provided to [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/).

[FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Director](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) [Kash Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) was in south [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/) at the time with one of the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/)’s [two available jets](https://www.gulfstream.com/en/aircraft/gulfstream-g500/) and had given an order to hold the other for another team that would not normally respond to the scene, according to the whistleblower and the sources. The evidence response team instead had to drive through the night amid a snowstorm to reach the university in [Providence](https://www.providenceri.gov/), [Rhode Island](https://www.ri.gov/), by 9 o’clock the next morning, according to the whistleblower’s account.

[Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Richard Durbin.(D-IL)](https://www.durbin.senate.gov/),  the ranking [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) on the [Senate Judiciary Committee](http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/), obtained the whistleblower’s account. In a letter sent Tuesday to the [Government Accountability Office](https://www.gao.gov/) and the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/)’s inspector general, [Durbin](https://www.durbin.senate.gov/) accused [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) of harming the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/)’s critical investigations due to his misuse of [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) resources and aircraft and his inexperience.

“The [Director](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s misplaced priorities and poor management of the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/)’s resources — including its aircraft — also harmed the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/)’s ability to respond to the shooting at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/) on December 13, 2025,” [Durbin](https://www.durbin.senate.gov/) wrote.

[Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) had been flown in one of the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/)’s two jets to south [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/) and was there on Dec. 13, the day of the shooting, and didn’t fly back until the afternoon of Dec. 14, according to sources who spoke to [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/) confidentially in order to speak candidly and avoid potential retribution.

According to the whistleblower’s account, [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) ordered that the Hostage Rescue Team be put on standby after learning of the shooting, which froze the use of the second plane by any other [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) team. [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) officials were confused by his order as numerous SWAT team agents in the nearest local field offices — in this case, [Boston](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/boston) and [New York](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/newyork) — would ordinarily be called upon to provide immediate support, rather than the [Quantico](https://www.townofquantico.org/), [Virginia](https://www.virginia.gov/)-based Hostage Rescue Team.

[FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) spokesman [Ben Williamson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-williamson-b6926580/) disputed the whistleblower’s account, saying that evidence response agents in the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/)’s [Boston field office](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/boston) were on the scene roughly two hours after a shooter opened fire at roughly 4 o’clock in the afternoon.

“This was not immediately a case with federal nexus,” [Williamson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-williamson-b6926580/) added, explaining the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) did not initially take the lead in the case. “It was a state-led homicide investigation. [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) was in an assisting role until later.”

He added that the [director](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s jet travel to [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/) didn’t harm the mission because sending a plane to [Rhode Island](https://www.ri.gov/) wasn’t necessary.
“If the [Director](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) happens to be out of town, he always offers the plane if needed anyway — and did so here,” [Williamson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-williamson-b6926580/) said. “It wasn’t needed.”

In the Dec. 13 shooting, a former [Brown](https://www.brown.edu/) graduate student, Cláudio Manuel Neves Valente, entered a university classroom building, then killed two students and wounded nine others before fleeing the scene. A [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://www.mit.edu/) professor and former classmate of Valente’s was later shot and killed. After a five-day manhunt, police found Valente dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in a storage unit.

The [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/)’s evidence response teams are known for specialized skills in mapping out a crime scene and collecting forensic evidence, and often use technical gear to help in gathering latent fingerprints and photographic clues. Agents who specialize in evidence collection are based in [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) field offices around the country, but specialists based in the [Quantico](https://www.townofquantico.org/) unit that oversees evidence review and crime scene reconstruction are some of its most experienced veterans and often deploy in the case of a major crime scene or mass shooting.

An [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) official familiar with [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s travel said he was using the jet that December weekend to visit his elderly parents, but declined to say where the parents lived due to security concerns. Property databases reviewed by [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/) indicate [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s parents reside in south [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/).

According to [Durbin](https://www.durbin.senate.gov/) — and multiple sources who spoke to [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/) — [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s frequent use of the plane for ostensibly personal travel has left the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) struggling to deploy for emergency assignments when teams need access to a government plane quickly.

[Durbin](https://www.durbin.senate.gov/) wrote that his letter served as a follow-up to one [he sent in May](https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-requests-probe-into-justice-department-use-of-aircraft-for-personal-or-political-purposes) requesting that the [GAO](https://www.gao.gov/) conduct a comprehensive review of the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/)’s use of government-controlled aircraft by senior executives.

“Since his confirmation as [Director](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) of the [Federal Bureau of Investigation](https://www.fbi.gov/), [Kash Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) has seemingly engaged in what amounts to irresponsible joyriding on [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) and [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/)-operated aircraft at the expense of the American taxpayer and to the detriment of ongoing Bureau operations,” the senator wrote.

“I request that the [GAO](https://www.gao.gov/)’s ongoing review address the new information outlined below and that the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/)’s [Office of the Inspector General](https://oig.justice.gov/) ([DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) [OIG](https://oig.justice.gov/)) investigate [Director](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s misuse or mismanagement of government resources.”

[Durbin](https://www.durbin.senate.gov/) took note of [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s [recent trip to Milan on an FBI jet](https://www.ms.now/news/kash-patel-headed-to-milan-for-the-olympics-on-the-fbi-jet), pointing out that [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) spokesperson [Ben Williamson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-williamson-b6926580/) claimed that the [director](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) did not go to [Italy](https://www.governo.it/) “to hang out at the [Olympics](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026) on the taxpayer dime.”

“However,” [Durbin](https://www.durbin.senate.gov/) noted, “by the [Director](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s own admission and video accounts, on February 22, 2026, he celebrated with the gold medal-winning [U.S. Men’s Olympic Hockey Team](https://teamusa.usahockey.com/2026olympicmenroster?) after their victory.”

The [Milan](https://www.comune.milano.it/) trip occurred on the same weekend an armed intruder attempted to breach [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) residence, [Durbin](https://www.durbin.senate.gov/) noted.

While the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [director](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) is required to fly privately for security reasons, “personal leisure activities and travel bucket list should not dictate work travel, nor should it have a material impact on the Bureau’s time-sensitive operations and investigations,” [Durbin](https://www.durbin.senate.gov/) wrote.

[Durbin](https://www.durbin.senate.gov/) said a “credible source” told [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) staffers that during a meeting last year, [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) told [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) field office personnel: “If you have golf, hockey, fishing, or hunting and beautiful sights, you’re going to see a lot of me.”

The senator added that [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s “frequent and unapologetic use of [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) or [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/)-controlled aircraft for personal travel raises concerns about whether he is complying with applicable regulations and reimbursement requirements for non-mission-related travel and whether the Department has sufficient internal controls to track and enforce those obligations.”

[Durbin](https://www.durbin.senate.gov/) also said the whistleblower account makes clear that [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s travel has “materially harm(ed) the mission of the very agency he has sworn to lead. As federal law enforcement is navigating multiple crises — including Americans facing significant danger after a prominent cartel leader was killed in [Mexico](https://www.gob.mx/) — the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) cannot afford to have its resources further stretched by a [Director](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) who views its staff and aircraft as a means to support his jet-setting lifestyle.”

[Durbin](https://www.durbin.senate.gov/) ended by noting that [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) criticized his predecessor’s use of the same aircraft for personal travel in a 2023 interview when he stated, “[Chris Wray](https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors/christopher-wray) doesn’t need a government-funded [G5 jet](https://www.gulfstream.com/en/aircraft/gulfstream-g500/) to go to vacation. Maybe we ground that plane. \$15,000 every time it takes off.”
