title: "My Dumb State: South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson Wants to Make Measles Great Again"
---

[South Carolina](https://www.sc.gov/) [Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/) [Alan Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general/) has an extremely severe case of dumbassedness. He wants to remove ftom proposed legislation, the mandatory requirement of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine, claiming religious exemption.

Not vaccinating against measles is a purely selfish decision. It potentially harms im​mu​no​com​pro​mised individuals, cancer patients. Achieving herd immunity prevents diseases from spreading like wildfire.

FEB 06, 2026

(COLUMBIA, S.C.) –South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson made the following statement condemning [S.897](https://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess126_2025-2026/bills/897.htm), a bill that would remove the religious exemption for the MMR vaccine for children attending public schools.

“This bill goes too far. Since 2020, we've seen a concerted push to curtail personal liberty in the name of health and safety. Eliminating religious exemptions and mandating medical decisions by force is not who we are as a state or country. The right to be free from compelled bodily intrusion is at the heart of the American experiment. Government should not substitute its judgment for parents, families, or individual conscience. Encouragement is not coercion. Personal freedom and parental rights must come first. As Attorney General, I will always stand for liberty, families, and the Constitution.”
