## [Kash Patel's Olympic hockey video sums up his credibility problem](https://www.ms.now/opinion/kash-patel-olympic-hockey-video-credibility)

_The [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [director](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s inappropriate partying sums up his struggles with being taken seriously._

Feb. 23, 2026, 7:11 PM EST
By [Zeeshan Aleem](https://www.ms.now/author/zeeshan-aleem)

[FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Director](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) [Kash Patel’s giddy locker-room celebration](https://www.ms.now/news/fbi-chief-shown-in-raucous-locker-room-celebration-during-olympics-trip) with [the U.S. Olympic men’s hockey team](https://www.ms.now/ms-now/watch/fbi-director-kash-patel-parties-with-team-usa-olympic-hockey-gold-medal-winners-2488603203508) after it won the gold medal was a curious spectacle — and it highlights much of what makes one of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s most audacious side men so objectionable.

[Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) — clad in a [Team USA](https://www.teamusa.com/) jersey seemingly loaned to him by a player — can be seen in viral videos swigging beer from a bottle, spraying beer on other players, thumping a table, jumping up and down, and otherwise preening as though he accomplished something.

> **[Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s locker-room appearance warrants extra scrutiny because it is not the first time suspicions have been raised that he could be abusing his government power.**

The first question that springs to mind is why was [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) there? Locker-room celebrations are intimate spaces for players to express their joy, and it’s more than a little peculiar for the [director](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) of the federal government’s top [law enforcement agency](https://www.fbi.gov/)) to even be in attendance, let alone partake in the celebrations as if he just battled [Team Canada](https://olympic.ca/) himself. ([posted to his personal X account](https://x.com/kash_patel/status/2025736412125855918?s=46) on Sunday: “For the very concerned media — yes, I love America and was extremely humbled when my friends, the newly minted [Gold Medal](https://teamusa.usahockey.com/mensteams) winners on [Team USA](https://www.teamusa.com/), invited me into the locker room to celebrate this historic moment with the boys.”)

The second question is whether [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) may have exaggerated or manufactured his [official government purposes for attending the Olympics in Milan](https://www.ms.now/news/kash-patel-headed-to-milan-for-the-olympics-on-the-fbi-jet) as a pretext for a personal trip as a hockey fan. When [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/) reported last week that [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) was taking the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/)’s [Gulfstream](https://www.gulfstream.com/) [jet](https://www.gulfstream.com/en/aircraft/gulfstream-g500/) to [Milan](https://www.comune.milano.it/), the [FBI pushed back on reporting](https://www.ms.now/news/fbi-chief-shown-in-raucous-locker-room-celebration-during-olympics-trip) indicating he was going to [Italy](https://www.governo.it/) on the taxpayers’ dime to watch hockey, with [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) spokesman [Ben Williamson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-williamson-b6926580/) adding that “it was unfair to describe the trip as having to do with hockey or pleasure.” That characterization from the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) is misleading, as clearly the trip involved those qualities in an exceptional way.

While it’s acceptable for government officials to partake in sightseeing during their personal time if their schedule allows, it’s another thing altogether to gain exceptional VIP access to athletes’ private celebrations that would otherwise be inaccessible to them.

@RalphHightower: There’s sightseeing, then there's traveling for major sporting events, such as [The Olympics](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026).

[Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s locker-room appearance warrants extra scrutiny because it is not the first time suspicions have been raised that he could be abusing his government power. In December, [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) on the [House Judiciary Committee](https://judiciary.house.gov/) said they were investigating whether [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) was using a government jet inappropriately to subsidize his social life, [including what they called a “date night” with his girlfriend](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/democrats-probe-fbi-director-kash-patel-fbi-gulfstream-jet/). ([Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) [denied wrongdoing](https://www.axios.com/2025/12/01/kash-patel-alexis-wilkins-fbi-plane-democrats) and said he reimburses the government for his personal travel.) And [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/) [reported in December](https://www.ms.now/news/kash-patel-girlfriend-fbi-detail-wilkins-ride-home) that [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)  has “on more than one occasion ordered that the security detail protecting his girlfriend escort one of her allegedly inebriated friends home after a night of partying.” (The [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) denied that this happened and called it “made up.”)

Even if one is not scandalized by [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) using his privileged government position to squirm his way into a victorious locker room, there are long-standing concerns about his professionalism — and this doesn’t help assuage them.

[Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) is supposed to be a serious figure of authority, and his credibility rests on appearing restrained and impartial. Partying in the bro-iest manner imaginable isn’t appropriate for someone with his responsibilities. Especially since he doesn’t have a good track record for doing what he’s supposed to be doing when he’s working.

Consider how many current and former [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) agents have [sharply criticized](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/01/fbi-kash-patel-leaked-report) [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s behavior at his post, including his [reported obsession with prioritizing social media strategy over actual law enforcement](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2026/01/22/magazine/trump-kash-patel-fbi-agents.html). In the immediate aftermath of the assassination of right-wing activist [Charlie Kirk](https://www.charliekirk.com/), [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) broke internal communications protocols and [spread misinformation](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/11/technology/charlie-kirk-falsehoods-speculation-conspiracy.html) about the pursuit of the suspect.

Given [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s reputation for being in over his head with his job, it would seem the last thing he’d want is to be caught partying in a manner unbefitting a man of his position. But [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) and so many other top officials in the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) don’t appear to care about being perceived as competent. They care about being perceived as powerful — and getting away with whatever they can.
