## [Nicolle Wallace on why the latest MAGA break over the Epstein files is a ‘huge deal’](https://www.ms.now/news/shawn-ryan-maga-backlash-trump-jeffrey-epstein-files-pam-bondi)

_The [“Deadline: White House”](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house) [host](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/nicolle-wallace-biography-n1157571) said the criticism against [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is “getting louder and louder,” especially among members of his [MAGA](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) base._

Join [Nicolle Wallace](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/nicolle-wallace-biography-n1157571) on [Deadline White House](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house) with reaction to the continued fallout over the way [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) has handled the Epstein Files scandal, and how the lies fed to the [MAGA](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) base have backfired spectacularly on the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) with many of those who voted for him over this issue no longer trusting [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) or his [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/). 

The fallout over the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/)’s handling of the [Epstein files](https://www.ms.now/news/jeffrey-epstein-spy-espionage-poland) continues. In a [a video posted to X](https://x.com/ShawnRyan762/status/2023534876889161992), prominent right-wing podcaster [Shawn Ryan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawn-ryan-84b97314a/) went on a profanity-filled tirade against the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/), signaling out the [attorney general](https://www.justice.gov/) after her [combative testimony on Capitol Hill](https://www.ms.now/opinion/pam-bondi-testimony-epstein-files-trump-reveal) last week.

“I’ve been pretty quiet about [Pam Bondi](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general) in front of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) the other day, talking about how the Dow is up to 50,000,” [Ryan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawn-ryan-84b97314a/) said. “Nobody gives a fuck, because what you should be talking about is how you are going to investigate and prosecute any pedophiles that were running around on Epstein Island. … But we didn’t talk about that, did we?”

The former [Navy](https://www.navy.mil/) [SEAL](https://www.navy.com/careers-benefits/careers/special-operations/navy-seal) then shared his assessment of [Donald Trump](https://www.ms.now/white-house)’s second term. “Man, the lies are stacking up fast,” he said. “I’ve never seen so many fucking lies appear in, what, a year? It’s only been a  fucking year. Look at all the  fucking lies.”

On Tuesday’s [“Deadline: White House,”](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house) host [Nicolle Wallace](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/nicolle-wallace-biography-n1157571) reacted to [Ryan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawn-ryan-84b97314a/)’s comments and the growing [MAGA](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) backlash against [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).

“The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) is trying to declare ‘Case closed, nothing to see here with the Epstein files,’ but they’re just about the only people saying that,” she said, adding: “The criticisms are mounting. They’re getting louder and louder, and they’re increasingly on the right.”

[Wallace](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/nicolle-wallace-biography-n1157571) said [Ryan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawn-ryan-84b97314a/)’s remarks were a “huge deal” and stressed that the significance of his criticism of the president, to a [MAGA](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) audience, “cannot be overstated.”

The [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/) host said the [Epstein files](https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/53786-less-than-half-maga-republicans-strongly-approve-donald-trump-handling-jeffrey-epstein-investigation-december-20-22-2025-economist-yougov-poll) have caused a “big break” between [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and those who voted for him “because they hate the elites.”

“This feels like an issue where the permission structure was baked in before [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was re-elected,” she said. “Because this issue was such a huge deal on the right.”

[Wallace](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/nicolle-wallace-biography-n1157571) also noted that even she was caught off guard by how widespread the backlash has been. “I am surprised by how enraged they are by the handling,” she said.

The [“Deadline: White House”](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house) host said the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) “made the wrong assessment,” adding that “the political damage for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) isn’t just being in them [the Epstein files]; it’s hiding them.”

That, [Wallace](https://www.ms.now/deadline-white-house/nicolle-wallace-biography-n1157571) argued, was the true betrayal of [MAGA](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). “Hiding them is the thing that goes against this religion and this worldview,” she said.
