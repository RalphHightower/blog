## [Trump reportedly thanked FBI agents directly after raid of Georgia elections office](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-reportedly-thanked-fbi-agents-directly-after-raid-of-georgia-elections-office)

_A [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) leader rejected claims that the president was involved in the [Fulton County](https://fultoncountyga.gov/) raid. There’s new evidence pointing in the opposite direction._

Feb. 2, 2026, 2:19 PM EST
By [Steve Benen](https://www.ms.now/author/steve-benen)

On the latest episode of [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/)’s [“State of the Union,”](https://www.cnn.com/videos/title-2248506) host [Dana Bash](https://www.cnn.com/profiles/dana-bash-profile#about) asked [Deputy](https://www.justice.gov/dag/) [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Todd Blanche](https://www.justice.gov/dag) a good question: Why was [Donald Trump](https://www.ms.now/white-house) involved in the [FBI raid](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/as-the-fbi-searches-fulton-co-trumps-2020-election-fixation-has-escalated-beyond-whining) on the elections office in [Fulton County](https://fultoncountyga.gov/), [Georgia](https://www.georgia.gov/)? [Blanche](https://www.justice.gov/dag), a former [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) defense attorney, challenged the premise of the question.

“I don’t believe he was involved,” [Blanche replied](https://transcripts.cnn.com/show/sotu/date/2026-02-01/segment/01).

There’s fresh evidence pointing in the opposite direction. [The New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/us/politics/trump-fbi-phone-call-georgia-gabbard.html) on some behind-the-scenes details on what transpired when [Director of National Intelligence](https://www.dni.gov/) [Tulsi Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) personally met with [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) agents after they executed a search warrant near [Atlanta](https://www.atlaantaga.gov/).

> _What occurred during the meeting was even further outside the bounds of normal law enforcement procedure. [Ms. Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) used her cellphone to call [Mr. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), who did not initially pick up but called back shortly after, [according to three people with knowledge of the meeting]._

The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) addressed the agents on speakerphone, asking them questions as well as praising and thanking them for their work on the inquiry, according to three people with knowledge of the discussion.

According to the [Times](https://www.nytimes.com/)’ report, which has not been independently verified by [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/), the call was “fairly short” and was similar to “a pep rally or a coach giving an encouraging halftime speech to his players.”

To briefly recap for those new to the story, the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/)’s raid execution of the search warrant last week, an obvious [part of Trump’s ongoing crusade](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/as-the-fbi-searches-fulton-co-trumps-2020-election-fixation-has-escalated-beyond-whining) related to his [2020 election defeat](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf), was and is tough to defend.

There’s no credible reason for federal law enforcement to seize these election materials, which have already been thoroughly scrutinized, just as there’s no reason for the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) to act as a vehicle for the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s discredited conspiracy theories. The fact that [Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence), [eager to work her way back](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/why-did-tulsi-gabbard-join-an-fbi-raid-tied-to-trumps-election-conspiracy-theory) into the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s good graces, [personally participated in the raid](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/why-did-tulsi-gabbard-join-an-fbi-raid-tied-to-trumps-election-conspiracy-theory), [added a scandalous element](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/tulsi-gabbard-role-fbi-fulton-county-raid-election-2020) to a burgeoning controversy.

[NBC News report explained](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/tulsi-gabbard-scrutiny-showing-fbi-raid-georgia-election-hub-rcna256525), “Accompanying [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) agents on a raid is unprecedented for the chief of U.S. intelligence, whose job is to track threats from foreign adversaries. In her role overseeing the country’s spy agencies, [Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) is prohibited by law from taking part in domestic law enforcement.”

But if the [Times](https://www.nytimes.com/)’ reporting is correct, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s attaboy phone call with the agents on hand in [Fulton County](https://fultoncountyga.gov/) removed all doubt about the brazenness of the gambit.

“Even for a [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) who has radically transformed the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) and the [F.B.I.](https://www.fbi.gov/) by trampling over their political independence and using them as tools for personal retribution, [Mr. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) appears to be taking that kind of involvement to a new level,” the [Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) added. “Rather than going to senior department or [F.B.I.](https://www.fbi.gov/) officials, Mr. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) spoke directly to the frontline agents doing the granular work of a politically sensitive investigation in which he has a large personal stake.”

So much for “I don’t believe he was involved.”
