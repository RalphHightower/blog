## [Trump moves to rewrite election rules unilaterally](https://www.ms.now/news/trump-moves-to-rewrite-election-rules-unilaterally)

_The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has directed his [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) counsel to explore a voter ID executive order, even as his own lawyers warn it would likely be stricken down — the latest test of his executive authority over American elections._

Feb. 26, 2026, 5:00 AM EST
By [Jake Traylor](https://www.ms.now/author/jake-traylor) and [Vaughn Hillyard](https://www.ms.now/author/vaughn-hillyard-2)

WASHINGTON — [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has directed his [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) counsel’s office to explore the feasibility of an executive order requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration and photo identification at polling locations nationwide, even as his own lawyers have warned the moves would likely run into legal trouble, according to a senior [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) official granted anonymity to discuss internal dynamics. [Office of Management and Budget](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/) [Director Russell Vought](https://www.linkedin.com/in/russ-vought-787396226/) and [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) staff secretary [Will Scharf](https://www.linkedin.com/in/will-scharf-35214a10/) are among those overseeing the effort to determine whether a legally viable path forward exists.

It is the latest sign that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) intends to reshape American elections unilaterally and without congressional buy-in, testing the limits of his executive authority.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s fixation with false claims of widespread voter fraud has clashed with efforts by some [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) aides to keep his midterm message focused on kitchen table concerns. Inside the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)s’ sweeping victories in November were widely viewed as a warning about the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s political standing. Going forward, the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s strategic intent was to have [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) focus more on affordability, multiple [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) officials tell [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/).

But there’s a gap between his top aides’ strategy and [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s behavior.

During a closed-door meeting of top [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) aides and [Cabinet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/the-cabinet/) officials on Capitol Hill last week, deputy chief of staff James Blair leveled with the group that it was unlikely that they’d be able to control [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s messaging. His advice: Let [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) be [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), and focus on delivering consistent, data-driven messaging on the trail.

Some in the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) view voter ID as a potent political wedge issue: polarizing, yes, but also a powerful base mobilizer. In that sense, a senior [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) official said, it is not unlike the issue of transgender athletes participating in women’s sports, which the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) campaign hammered relentlessly in 2024 — not a top concern for most voters, but one that, when put directly to them, generates passionate agreement.

## The outside network

Still, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s inner team has not actively pushed stolen election claims as part of its formal midterm strategy. Outside allies, however, have had little trouble keeping the issue alive and made the case to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) that emphasizing the issue is a winning stance that galvanizes his supporters. 

[Cleta Mitchell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cleta-mitchell-42b6943/), a [MAGA](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-aligned attorney and founder of the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-aligned [Election Integrity Network](https://www.electionintegritynetwork.org/), has made several recent visits to the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and is regularly in contact with the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), working to keep election-related issues prominent in his thinking, according to a source familiar with her engagement.

The influence operation has a formal side as well. The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has tapped Kurt Olsen, a prominent lawyer [involved in the “Stop the Steal” movement](https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/white-house-hires-stop-the-steal-lawyer-to-investigate-2020-election-claims-6395d322?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqcQsvIAW7I8Ncx6LDolKVzIw_ZA6fSNxNhS6V1vuHhrjbgt8va7qaZQgT9L0x4%3D&gaa_ts=699faa15&gaa_sig=Honhk26YzRqbbeU4-_45AAM0KY0gINwIZawLt6-CqyOQ9YwO7c6k7WaUdlgdftuldfi7jCDouoU-w4QO251Opw%3D%3D), as a special government employee to lead election-related inquiries directly from the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), giving the effort an official foothold inside the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/). 

But it is [Steve Bannon](https://warroom.org/), operating from outside the government entirely, who has emerged as perhaps the most active outside proponent for expanded investigations into allegations about past elections, according to multiple sources close to the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). [Bannon](https://warroom.org/) passes along relevant articles and information to a close aide who serves as one of the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s most direct channels for outside information — a pipeline that has helped ensure that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s focus on “election integrity” has not dimmed despite the competing priorities of governing.

On Tuesday night, that messaging infused itself into [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s State of the Union address from the dais. 

“They want to cheat. They have cheated. And their policy is so bad that the only way they can get elected is to cheat,” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said, referring to [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)s. “And we’re going to stop it.”

## The legal and constitutional wall

During those same remarks, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) tried to apply political pressure on [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [senators](https://www.senate.gov/) to pass the [SAVE America Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/7296) — a [House](https://www.house.gov/)-passed bill requiring proof of citizenship when registering to vote and photo ID to cast a ballot. But the measure appears doomed with near-unanimous [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)ic opposition, and with some [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [senators](https://www.senate.gov/), including [Lisa Murkowski (T-AK)](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/), having already [signaled their own resistance](https://x.com/lisamurkowski/status/2026024615999332830?s=20) to the measure, which would require 60 votes for passage.

The [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s withering hope of congressional approval has led the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) to attempt to do it himself, albeit on questionable legal grounds.

“There will be Voter I.D. for the Midterm Elections, whether approved by [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) or not!” Trump wrote in a [Truth Social post](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116065471857020644) on Feb. 13.

But the reality is that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s authority to unilaterally change election procedures is sharply limited, and the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has already tested those limits — and lost. Last March, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [signed an executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/preserving-and-protecting-the-integrity-of-american-elections/) requiring proof of citizenship on the national mail voter registration form and on a ballot request form used by military and overseas voters. A [federal judge struck down both provisions](https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2025cv0946-236) on separation-of-powers grounds.

“The Framers of our [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/) entrusted this power to the parts of our government that they believed would be most responsive to the will of the people: first to the States, and then, in some instances, to [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/),” wrote [U.S. District Court](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/) [Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/senior-judge-colleen-kollar-kotelly). “They assigned no role at all to the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).”

Under [Article 1](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/article-1/) of the [Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/), the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) of elections belongs to states and localities; any nationwide changes to voting law must pass through [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/). But rather than accept those constraints, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has pushed other arms of the government to advance the effort.

The [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/) secretary, [Kristi Noem](https://www.dhs.gov/kristi-noem), asserted at an event in [Maricopa County](https://www.maricopa.gov/), [Arizona](https://www.az.gov/), this month that ensuring only citizens vote in federal elections falls within her department’s purview. Days later, the department’s Homeland Security Investigations unit launched a nationwide campaign to investigate and prosecute naturalized citizens who may have improperly voted or registered  in past elections before obtaining citizenship.

The [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) has fared no better in court. As of February, it had sued 23 states to obtain voter roll data, arguing that the files are needed to verify that only eligible Americans cast ballots. A federal judge in [Michigan](https://www.michigan.gov/som) rejected that request earlier this month.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has also applied pressure at the state level. He promoted on social media the idea that [Georgia](https://www.georgia.gov/)’s [State Election Board](https://sos.ga.gov/state-election-board) — controlled by three [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) allies — should assume control of elections in [Fulton County](https://fultoncountyga.gov/), the state’s most populous and diverse county. Such a move could allow his supporters to install an administrator with authority over early voting hours, drop box locations and voter registration in the heavily [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) county. At a rally there last week, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) called mail-in voting “crooked as hell,” praised the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/)’s seizure of the state’s 2020 ballots and told the crowd, “We’re cleaning it up.”

The current push follows a pattern established after [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [2020 defeat](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf), when he put pressure on officials in several battleground states to investigate unproven and false claims of fraud and to decertify election results. Rep. Mo Brooks (T-AL), said that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), while at [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) in 2021, [urged him to build congressional support](https://x.com/VaughnHillyard/status/1506726083026202635?s=20) for “rescinding” the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf) and holding a new one — proposals that, Brooks said, were flatly unconstitutional.

In 2022, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) called on [Wisconsin](https://www.wisconsin.gov/) lawmakers to “decertify” his loss there following debunked claims from a private investigator. That year, he also demanded to be declared “the rightful winner” of the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf) or to “have a new Election, immediately!”

“Does [Wisconsin](https://www.wisconsin.gov/) RECLAIM the Electors, turn over the Election to the actual winner (by a lot!), or sit back and do nothing as our Country continues to go to HELL?” [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wrote in a social media post at the time.

The courts have blocked him. [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) has refused him. And yet, with eight months until Election Day 2026, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has arrived at the same conclusion he reached in 2020, in 2021, in 2022 and again now: that the electoral system is broken, that he alone can fix it and that the law is an obstacle to be tested rather than a boundary to be observed.
