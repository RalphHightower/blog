## [FBI whistleblower allegations against Patel create a test for congressional Republicans](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/fbi-whistleblower-allegations-against-patel-create-a-test-for-congressional-republicans)

_[GOP](https://www.gop.com/) lawmakers were willing to defend the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [director](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s antics in [Milan](https://www.comune.milano.it/), but are they also willing to defend allegations of systemic abuses?_

Feb. 25, 2026, 11:22 AM EST
By [Steve Benen](https://www.ms.now/author/steve-benen)

Long before [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Director Kash Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) was filmed partying with the [U.S. men’s Olympic hockey team](https://teamusa.usahockey.com/2026olympicmenroster?) after they won the gold, he was facing [months’ worth of accusations](https://www.thebulwark.com/p/kash-patel-fbi-director-private-jet-problem-nashville) that he had [misused FBI jets for personal reasons](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/facing-difficult-questions-use-fbi-jet-kash-patel-pitches-weak-defense-rcna241658). But the focus on the former podcast personality’s jet-setting habits took on greater significance after he flew to [Milan](https://www.comune.milano.it/) [and celebrated at taxpayers’ expense](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/kash-patel-partying-with-the-olympic-mens-hockey-team).

To be sure, an [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [spokesperson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-williamson-b6926580/) [insisted to MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/news/kash-patel-headed-to-milan-for-the-olympics-on-the-fbi-jet) last week that [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) visited [Italy](https://www.governo.it/) for a series of business meetings, not leisure, which justified his use of a bureau jet. That was [a difficult claim to take seriously](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/kash-patel-partying-with-the-olympic-mens-hockey-team), made worse when someone [leaked the director’s internal schedule](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/24/us/politics/kash-patel-fbi-olympics-milan.html) to [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/).

Despite similar allegations [leading to the ouster of a previous FBI director](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/kash-patel-partying-with-the-olympic-mens-hockey-team) in 1993, congressional [Republicans](https://www.go) have appeared eager to lend their support to [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) in the wake of his latest controversy. [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Ted Cruz (T-TX)](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3mfml54d3by2i) and [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Jim Jordan (T-OH4)](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3mfmqpeyacg25), for example, separately endorsed the director’s antics this week, seemingly indifferent to questions about the possible misuse of public resources.

Their support, however, came before [the latest reporting from MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/news/senator-slams-kash-patel-for-use-of-fbi-jet-asks-for-investigation) about related allegations from an [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) whistleblower. From the report:

> _Agents with the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/)’s elite evidence response team were delayed in reaching the scene of a mass shooting at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/) in December because there was no [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) plane available to take them to [Rhode Island](https://www.ri.gov/), according to three sources and a whistleblower’s account newly provided to Congress._

[FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Director Kash Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) was in south [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/) at the time with one of the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/)’s two available jets and had given an order to hold the other for another team that would not normally respond to the scene, according to the whistleblower and the sources. The evidence response team instead had to drive through the night amid a snowstorm to reach the university in [Providence](https://www.providenceri.gov/), [Rhode Island](https://www.ri.gov/), by 9 o’clock the next morning, according to the whistleblower’s account.

The whistleblower’s account was obtained by [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Dick Durbin of Illinois (D-IL)](https://www.durbin.senate.gov/), the top [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) on the [Senate Judiciary Committee](http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/), who urged the [Government Accountability Office](https://www.gao.gov/) and the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/)’s [inspector general](https://oig.justice.gov/) to investigate [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s alleged abuses.

“Through additional, credible whistleblower disclosures, I have learned how the [Director](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s decisions related to [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) or [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/)-controlled aircraft have negatively impacted high-profile criminal investigations,” [Durbin wrote](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2026-02-24%20Letter%20to%20GAO%20and%20DOJ%20IG%20on%20Kash%20Patel%20Olympic%20Travel.pdf).

The [retiring Illinois senator](https://www.durbin.senate.gov/) added that a “credible source” notified [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) staffers that during a meeting last year, [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel) told [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) field office personnel, “If you have golf, hockey, fishing, or hunting and beautiful sights, you’re going to see a lot of me.”

The question for [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) lawmakers is simple: You were willing to defend [Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)’s antics in [Milan](https://www.comune.milano.it/), but are you also willing to defend allegations of systemic abuses?

MS NOW exclusively reports that a whistleblower has told Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) that [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) [Director Kash Patel](https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/director-patel)'s use of his government jet has harmed investigations. This includes delaying the [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/) shooting response. MS NOW Senior Investigative Reporter Carol Leonnig joins Katy Tur with more details.
