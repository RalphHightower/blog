## [Key senator: Tulsi Gabbard’s line on FBI raid ‘raises more questions than it answers’](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/tulsi-gabbard-letter-fbi-raid-fulton-county)

_If the [DNI](https://www.dni.gov/) and her team hoped her letter to [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) would end the controversy, they have reason to be disappointed._

Feb. 3, 2026, 11:30 AM EST
By [Steve Benen](https://www.ms.now/author/steve-benen)

The fact that the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) executed a search warrant last week on an elections office in [Georgia](https://www.georgia.gov/) is itself a burgeoning controversy. The raid was an obvious [extension of Donald Trump’s ongoing crusade](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/as-the-fbi-searches-fulton-co-trumps-2020-election-fixation-has-escalated-beyond-whining)’s ongoing crusade related to his [2020 election defeat](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf). Effectively a vehicle for the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s discredited conspiracy theories, there was no credible reason for federal law enforcement to seize these election materials.

Similarly, there was also no reason for [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) to [personally thank](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-reportedly-thanked-fbi-agents-directly-after-raid-of-georgia-elections-office) the frontline [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) agents for their work.

But the whole mess was made worse by [Director of National Intelligence](https://www.dni.gov/) [Tulsi Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence)’s decision to [personally participate](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/why-did-tulsi-gabbard-join-an-fbi-raid-tied-to-trumps-election-conspiracy-theory) in the [Atlanta](https://www.atlaantaga.gov/)-area raid, [adding a scandalous element](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/tulsi-gabbard-role-fbi-fulton-county-raid-election-2020).

An [NBC News report explained](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/tulsi-gabbard-scrutiny-showing-fbi-raid-georgia-election-hub-rcna256525), “In her role overseeing the country’s spy agencies, [Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) is prohibited by law from taking part in domestic law enforcement.”

On Monday afternoon, the [DNI](https://www.dni.gov/) began mounting a defense of sorts, sending [a four-page letter](https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000019c-21aa-dbc5-a7bd-39bec4830000) to Capitol Hill (the correspondence was addressed to top [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/) on the intelligence committees, but it was sent as well as to several other members from both parties and both chambers). In it, [Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) didn’t merely try to justify her participation in the raid; she also confirmed that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) directed her to go to [Fulton County](https://fultoncountyga.gov/) and that she facilitated a call between the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) personnel.

If [Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) and her office expected this to end the controversy, they have reason to be disappointed.

After [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Mark Warner (D-VA)](https://www.warner.senate.gov/), the top [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) on the [Senate Intelligence Committee](http://www.intelligence.senate.gov/), received the [DNI](https://www.dni.gov/)’s letter, his communications director said in a statement, “While [Director Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence)’s letter attempts to justify her presence at the [Fulton County](https://fultoncountyga.gov/) search, it raises more questions than it answers. [Senator Warner](https://www.warner.senate.gov/) plans to continue pressing for accountability.”

Similarly, a former senior national security official told [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/) that [Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence)’s role in the [Georgia](https://www.georgia.gov/) was “jaw dropping. There’s no justification for it.” The former official said that no previous [DNI](https://www.dni.gov/) had ever taken similar steps and noted how outraged [Republicans](https://www.gop.com/) would be if, for example, Avril Haines, the [Biden administration](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/)’s director of national intelligence, had been present during the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) search of [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/).

“It would be denounced,” the former official added. “The [DNI](https://www.dni.gov/) is supposed to not be involved in politics or even involved in [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) activities.”

This emerging scandal, in other words, is far from over.
