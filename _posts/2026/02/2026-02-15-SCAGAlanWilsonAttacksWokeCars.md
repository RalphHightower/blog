title: "My Dumb State: South Carolina Attorney General Attacks ‘Woke’ Cars, Trucks"
---

Who knew that cars and trucks can be woke? I didn't. 

Personally, any politician that uses ‘woke’ is a divider and not a uniter. [Alan Wilson (R)](https://wilsonforsc.com/) is running for governor of [South Carolina](https://www.sc.gov/)

The following are drawbacks that I think holding back the wide spread adoptions of electric vehicles (EV):

1. Range Anxiety 
2. Infrastructure (Charging stations are not as common as gas/diesel stations)
3. Charging Time to Full Capacity (Until changing times are about the same as filling up a tank, they are not viable for road trips.)

[South Carolina](https://www.sc.gov/) deserves a governor who understands the difference between governing and grandstanding, not a candidate who treats federal rulemaking like a culture‑war talent show. If “woke cars” are the biggest threat he can find, maybe he’s not looking in the right direction — though I’m sure he’ll remind us to carry an extra quart of blinker fluid just in case.

## [Attorney General Alan Wilson sends letter to EPA to remove woke EV standards - South Carolina Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/news/attorney-general-alan-wilson-sends-letter-to-epa-to-remove-woke-ev-standards/)

FEB 06, 2026

([COLUMBIA](https://www.columbiasc.gov/), [S.C.](https://www.sc.gov/)) –[South Carolina](,https://www.sc.gov/) [Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/) [Alan [Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general/) joined a letter to the [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/) alongside 23 states supporting the end of the [Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/)-era electric vehicle mandates.

"These mandates to increase the number of electric vehicles on the road only raised the costs of vehicles for Americans," [Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/) [Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general/) said. "Bringing these fuel standards back in line ensures our vehicles are safe, efficient, and affordable."

The states urge the [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/) to adopt ["The Safer Affordable Fuel Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule III for Model Years 2022 to 2031 Passenger Cars and Light Trucks"](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/12/05/2025-22014/the-safer-affordable-fuel-efficient-safe-vehicles-rule-iii-for-model-years-2022-to-2031-passenger) rule. In the [Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/94th-congress/senate-bill/622), [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) directed the [Secretary](https://www.transportation.gov/meet-secretary/us-transportation-secretary-sean-duffy) of [Transportation](https://www.transportation.gov/) to set [corporate average fuel-economy (CAFE)](https://www.nhtsa.gov/laws-regulations/corporate-average-fuel-economy) standards for “automobiles” at the “maximum feasible” level for each model year. The intent of [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) did not include the phasing out of internal-combustion engines in favor of electric vehicles.

“Electric vehicles are not the problem,” [Attorney General](https://www.scag.gov/) [Wilson](https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/meet-the-attorney-general/) stated. “Unlawful mandates that seek to control the market only bring constraint and harm to consumers and the automobile industry.”
