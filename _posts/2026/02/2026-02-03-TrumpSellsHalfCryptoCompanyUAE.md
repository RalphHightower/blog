## [Previously undisclosed UAE stake in Trump company sparks new controversy](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/previously-undisclosed-uae-stake-in-trump-company-sparks-new-controversy)

_The latest revelations led one [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org%) [senator](https://www.senate.gov/) to argue, “Foreign countries are bribing our president to sell out the American people.”_

Feb. 2, 2026, 11:02 AM EST
By [Steve Benen](https://www.ms.now/author/steve-benen)

In mid-September 2024, [Donald Trump](https://www.ms.now/white-house) had plenty on his plate. He was the [Republican Party](https://www.gop.com/)’s presidential nominee in a competitive race with roughly seven weeks until Election Day; he had just lost a debate against then-[Vice President Kamala Harris](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/administration/vice-president-harris/); and he was maintaining an active travel and media schedule.

But on Sept. 16, literally one day after an apparent assassination attempt, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) did something unheard of in American politics: He [launched a cryptocurrency business](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/looking-cash-trump-launches-new-family-crypto-project-rcna171431), called [World Liberty Financial](https://worldlibertyfinancial.com/).

Controversies soon followed. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) faced awkward questions, for example, about the [curious group of business partners](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/16/technology/trump-crypto-world-liberty-financial.html) with whom he had linked arms. A year later, in one of the most scandalous presidential pardons in American history, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [pardoned Changpeng Zhao](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/white-house-struggles-defend-trumps-pardon-founder-binance-crypto-exch-rcna239435), the convicted founder of the crypto exchange [Binance](https://www.kraken.com/lp/platform), which just so happened to have struck a lucrative business deal with [World Liberty Financial](https://worldlibertyfinancial.com/).

The broader story, however, hasn’t hit rock bottom just yet. [The Wall Street Journal reported](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/spy-sheikh-secret-stake-trump-crypto-tahnoon-ea4d97e8?st=DdLjND&):

> _Four days before [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s inauguration last year, lieutenants to an [Abu Dhabi](https://www.abudhabi.gov.ae/) royal secretly signed a deal with the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) family to purchase a 49% stake in their fledgling cryptocurrency venture for half a billion dollars, according to company documents and people familiar with the matter. The buyers would pay half up front, steering \$187 million to [Trump family entities](https://www.trump.com/)._

The deal with [World Liberty Financial](https://worldlibertyfinancial.com/), which hasn’t previously been reported, was signed by [Eric Trump](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erictrump/recent-activity/all/), the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s son. At least \$31 million was also slated to flow to entities affiliated with the family of [Steve Witkoff](https://www.witkoff.com/), a [World Liberty](https://worldlibertyfinancial.com/) co-founder who weeks earlier had been named U.S. envoy to the Middle East, the documents said.

The deal, the [Journal](https://www.wsj.com/) added, “marked something unprecedented in American politics: a foreign government official taking a major ownership stake in an incoming U.S. [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s company” — which, at the time, “had no products.”

Although the reporting wasn’t independently verified by [MS NOW](https://www.ms.now/), a spokesperson for [World Liberty Financial](https://worldlibertyfinancial.com/) confirmed the investment to [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/).

The [Journal](https://www.wsj.com/) added that the investment “was backed by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, an [Abu Dhabi](https://www.abudhabi.gov.ae/) royal who has been pushing the U.S. for access to tightly guarded artificial intelligence chips.” Tahnoon, brother to the [United Arab Emirates](https://u.ae%)’ president, is also sometimes referred to as the “spy sheikh.”

The [UAE](https://u.ae/) had initiated related efforts to obtain AI chip information during the [Biden administration](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/), which resisted for national security reasons, including concerns about the technology reaching [China](https://www.gov.cn/). But at about the time that the [UAE](https://u.ae/) struck a deal with the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-owned [company](https://www.trump.com/), the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) also approved an export deal for the AI technology the Emirati government wanted.

Imagine that.

The latest details led [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/) [Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Chris Van Hollen (S-MD)](https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/) [to argue](https://bsky.app/profile/vanhollen.senate.gov/post/3mdsw6i5cb227): “Foreign countries are bribing our [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) to sell out the American people.”

Ian Bassin, a veteran of the [Obama administration](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/), [added](https://bsky.app/profile/ianbassin.bsky.social/post/3mdud4klkwk27): “I was a [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) ethics lawyer. I used to advise people not to even accept a free cup of coffee from someone who had interests before them. And staff followed those rules. I can’t even find the words to describe the scale of [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s corruption here.”

In the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s first term, there was considerable interest in the emoluments clause and foreign interests renting rooms at [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)-owned properties. In his second term, the seeming corruption is spectacularly worse.

On [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/)’ [“This Week,”](https://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek) host [George Stephanopoulos](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/george-stephanopoulos-good-morning-america-anchor-biography/story?id=133369) asked [Deputy](https://www.justice.gov/dag/) [Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/) [Todd Blanche](https://www.justice.gov/dag/) about the burgeoning scandal. [Blanche](https://www.justice.gov/dag/), a former [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) defense counsel, [replied](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-2-1-26-deputy-attorney-general/story?id=129744451): “I love it when these papers talk about something being unprecedented or never happening before, as if the [Biden family](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) and the [Biden administration](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) didn’t do exactly the same thing, and they were just in office.”

[Blanche](https://www.justice.gov/dag/), referring to the [Journal](https://www.wsj.com/)’s reporting, added: “Look, I saw that article. I don’t have a comment on it beyond [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has been completely transparent when his family travels for business reasons.”

There are a few elements to this that are worth keeping in mind. First, never in American history has a foreign country bought a stake in a company owned by the American [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), even as the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) negotiated foreign policy matters with the other country. The idea that [Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) did “exactly the same thing” is plainly ridiculous.

Second, if ([Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) had been “completely transparent” about all of this, the [Journal](https://www.wsj.com/)’s reporting would have been old news. It wasn’t — because all of this had been secret from the public up until now.

And third, let’s not overlook the fact that [Blanche](https://www.justice.gov/dag/) was offered an opportunity to offer his best possible defense of the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/). Evidently, he couldn’t think of anything persuasive.

I guess that’s not too surprising, given how difficult it is to defend the indefensible.
