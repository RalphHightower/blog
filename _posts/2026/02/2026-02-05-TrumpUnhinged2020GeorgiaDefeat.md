_Claims of international interference in 2020 were largely limited to the fever swamps. In 2026, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is still swimming in the same ridiculous waters._

Feb. 5, 2026, 11:09 AM EST
By [Steve Benen](https://www.ms.now/author/steve-benen)

Four weeks ago, [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [briefly floated the idea of canceling future U.S. elections](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-midterm-elections-cancelling-2026). Three weeks ago, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [told Reuters](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-muses-on-midterms-when-you-think-of-it-we-shouldnt-even-have-an-election) that he’s so impressed with himself and his record that “when you think of it, we shouldn’t even have an election.”

This week, however, has been qualitatively worse — and more alarming.

On Monday, the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) endorsed a radical and unconstitutional power-grab, [insisting](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-ought-to-nationalize-the-voting-trump-eyes-radical-power-grab), “The [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s ought to nationalize the voting.” A day later, when the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) tried to assure the public that he didn’t mean what he clearly said, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) cut off his own team at the knees and [doubled down](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-nationalize-elections-federal-takeover), insisting a federal takeover of elections could be warranted because of widespread voting fraud that exists only in his overactive imagination.

On Wednesday, as part of [a lengthy interview](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-interview-nbc-news-extend-transcript-tom-llamas-super-bowl-2026-rcna257410) with [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/) anchor [Tom Llamas](https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/biography/tom-llamas-nbc-nightly-news-anchor-rcna209845), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) came out with all kinds of related comments, suggesting again he’s [interested in nationalizing](https://bsky.app/profile/factpostnews.bsky.social/post/3me33akvr6x2o) U.S. elections, [falsely claiming](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/fact-check-trump-interview-nbc-news-rcna257084) that he won the [2020 race](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf) that he lost, [baselessly accusing](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/fact-check-trump-interview-nbc-news-rcna257084) [Democratic](https://www.democrats.org/)-run cities of voter fraud (despite having no evidence whatsoever) and concluding that he’ll [only accept the results](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3me3gcxctgc22) of the 2026 midterms “if the elections are honest” — failing to note that he considers himself the sole arbiter of electoral honesty.

But of particular interest was the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s concerns about alleged international interference.

Last week, for example, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) used his social media platform [to promote an “Italygate” missive](https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-posts-discredited-conspiracy-theories-seizure-2020-ballots/story?id=129669660) that alleged Italian military satellites were secretly used to hack into U.S. voting machines to flip votes and cause [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s defeat. ([TPM](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/) [described this](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/2020s-most-insane-conspiracy-theory-italygate-returns) as “2020’s most insane conspiracy theory.”) This week, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [conceded to Llamas](https://bsky.app/profile/thebulwark.com/post/3me346qq5of2l) that he did amplify the message online.

And then he kept going down the same mind-numbing path.

First he claimed that [Fulton County](https://fultoncountyga.gov/), [Georgia](https://www.georgia.gov/), has been “under investigation for four years” — pointing to a probe that does not exist in reality. Then, when asked why [Director of National Intelligence](https://www.dni.gov/) [Tulsi Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) participated in the [FBI(https://www.fbi.gov/) raid, Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) said, “I don’t know, but, you know, a lot of the cheating comes from, it’s international cheating.”

On Thursday morning at a prayer breakfast, he made related comments after pointing to [Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence), who was in attendance. Referring to the [2020 race](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf), the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) added, “Let’s assume [Russia](http://government.ru/) had something to do with it. You can add [China](https://www.gov.cn/) and about five other countries.”

Oh my.

A couple of weeks after [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) lost his [2020 re-election bid](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf), his hapless lawyers held [a bewildering event](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/why-dangerous-press-conference-trump-s-lawyers-matters-n1248357) at the [Republican National Committee](https://www.gop.com/) headquarters, where they tried to describe a secret plot that only they were aware of.

The legal team pitched a hysterical tale involving [George Soros](https://www.georgesoros.com/), “communist money,” the [Clinton Foundation](https://www.clintonfoundation.org/), antifa, [Cuba](https://www.presidencia.gob.cu/en/) and possibly [China](https://www.gov.cn/). Rudy Giuliani and his colleagues also pointed the finger at [Venezuela](https://gob.ve/) and its former [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), Hugo Chávez, who’d died seven years earlier.

At the time, the absurdities became the subject of widespread ridicule and made it abundantly clear that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s lawyers had no credible evidence to support their election conspiracy theories.

But more than a half-decade later, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is still swimming in the same ridiculous waters.

[Sen.](https://www.senate.gov/) [Mark Warner (D-VA)](https://www.warner.senate.gov/), the top [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) on the [Senate Intelligence Committee](http://www.intelligence.senate.gov/), [explained](https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/why-did-tulsi-gabbard-join-an-fbi-raid-tied-to-trumps-election-conspiracy-theory) last week that if [Gabbard](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence) and her U.S. intelligence colleagues have reason to believe foreign actors interfered with the [2020 election](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf), they have an obligation to share those concerns with [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/).

Since that has not happened, it appears that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s nonsensical election conspiracy theories are reaching new depths of absurdity.
