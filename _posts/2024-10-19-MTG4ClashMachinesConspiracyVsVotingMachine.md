excerpt: "They marked Donald Trump and they marked who they were voting for the rest of the way down their ballot on the machine. When this voter printed their ballot and they looked, it had changed. It was not Donald Trump, it was not me and it was not the other ones they had voted for. It had switched. So they had to start over, and they went through it several times and it kept on making the same error. It kept on switching the votes.... It sounds similar to what we heard in 2020. This happened in Whitfield County in my district - GA-14. We vote on Dominion voting machines then it prints a paper ballot with our selections made on the machines. This voter's printed ballot had been changed from their selections made on the machine. Good thing they checked their paper ballot before turning it in! After several attempts of trying to change it to reflect their correct choices, they had to void the ballot and use a different machine. Please double check your printed ballot before you turn it in to make sure it has marked the candidates you voted for!!! – US Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (T-GA)"

## [Marjorie Taylor Greene Claims Dominion Machines Were 'Switching' Votes](https://www.newsweek.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-claims-dominion-machines-were-switching-votes-1971486)

Story by Aila Slisco. October 18, 2024.

@RalphHightower: Bless her heart. Last week, it was [U.S. Representative
Marjorie Taylor Greene \(T-GA), Conspiracy Machine](https://greene.house.gov/),
claiming that "they" control the weather. This week, [@MTG](https://green.house.gov/)
is claiming that [Dominion Voting Systems](https://www.dominionvoting.com/) is
changing votes.

- **Election Conspiracy Theory**: [Marjorie Taylor Greene](green.house,gov/) claims [Dominion Voting Systems](https://www.dominionvoting.com/) machines are "switching" votes in [Georgia](https://georgia.gov/), similar to allegations made in the 2020 election.
- **Dominion's Response**: [Dominion Voting Systems](https://www.dominionvoting.com/) denies these claims, stating that numerous audits and recounts have confirmed the accuracy and integrity of their systems.
- **Social Media Post**: [Greene](https://greene.house.gov/) shared an anonymous social media post as evidence, urging voters to double-check their printed ballots.
- **No Credible Evidence**: There is no credible evidence supporting the claim that [Dominion Voting Systems](https://www.dominionvoting.com/) machines have been "switching" votes in any election.

"They marked Donald Trump and they marked who they were voting for the rest of
the way down their ballot on the machine. When this voter printed their ballot
and they looked, it had changed. It was not Donald Trump, it was not [me](https://greene.house.gov/)
and it was not the other ones they had voted for. It had switched. So they had
to start over, and they went through it several times and it kept on making the
same error. It kept on switching the votes.... It sounds similar to what we heard
in 2020. This happened in Whitfield County in [my](https://greene.house.gov/)
district - GA-14. We vote on [Dominion](https://www.dominionvoting.com/setting-the-record-straight/)
voting machines then it prints a paper ballot with our selections made on the
machines. This voter's printed ballot had been changed from their selections
made on the machine. Good thing they checked their paper ballot before turning
it in! After several attempts of trying to change it to reflect their correct
choices, they had to void the ballot and use a different machine. Please double
check your printed ballot before you turn it in to make sure it has marked the
candidates you voted for!!!"

### [Setting the Record Straight: Facts About Dominion - Dominion Voting Systems](https://www.dominionvoting.com/setting-the-record-straight/)

GEORGIA UPDATE (Oct. 19, 2024): So far during early voting, a record-breaking
1.1 million voters in the [State of Georgia](https://georgia.gov/) have been
able to successfully cast their vote with a voter-verifiable paper ballot using
[Dominion](https://www.dominionvoting.com/) machines. The false claim that voting
machines can switch votes has been repeatedly debunked. As both state and local
election authorities have confirmed, the issue reported in Whitfield County was
due to voter error. The county provided the voter with an opportunity to mark and
print a new ballot with their correct choices and the issue was quickly resolved.
