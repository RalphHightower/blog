*The last thing in the world the former Joint Chiefs chair wants to be is political. For him to take this step shows the gravity of the situation.*

By Max Rose. Oct. 15, 2024, 1:56 PM EDT

In the book, *War*, released October 15, 2024, by author and veteran journalist Bob Woodward, writes that retired U.S. Army Gen. Mark Milley called Trump “fascist to the core” and “the most dangerous person to this country.”

This man saw Trump up close and personal and after that experience, he has said resoundingly that Trump should go nowhere near the Oval Office again.

Milley has dedicated his entire life to military service and the apolitical pursuit of serving the commander in chief — irrespective of his or her political affiliation. 

For him to take this step, in perhaps the most public manner imaginable, shows the gravity of the threat that Trump poses.

As the senior military adviser to the president, Milley served alongside Trump day in and day out. This man saw the former president up close and personal and after that experience, he has said resoundingly that Trump should go nowhere near the Oval Office again. We should take his message incredibly seriously. 

Milley’s warning came to light just days before Trump once again threatened to use his presidential power to go after political enemies. In an interview that aired Sunday on Fox News, Trump said he would deploy the military on American soil to handle what he called “the enemy from within” on Election Day. 

Should Trump win a second term, what we would be relying on to prevent the former president from taking these extraordinary steps is not just the rule of law but also the character of our men and women in uniform. These brave men and women swear an oath, not to an individual but to a document and a set of principles: the Constitution. I’ve taken this oath multiple times and sworn to protect this nation against enemies, both foreign as well as domestic. 

What Trump and his associates are seeking to do is not just weaponize the military but replace these brave men and women of character with loyalists and yes-men. That possibility is why Milley called Trump “the most dangerous person to this country.” That is the gravity of this election and that is what’s on the line in November.
