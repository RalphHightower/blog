excerpt: 'Pennsylvania and Georgia, two of the most hard-fought prizes for Trump and Harris, are the states that most worry election experts. MAGA loyalists are in place in Georgia at the state and county level. They control the state board and have authorized county officials to withhold vote certifications for any “reasonable inquiry” they might conjure; ordered that ballots be counted by hand, a time-consuming and mistake-prone practice; and insisted on naming vote monitors for Democratic-leaning Fulton County, home to Atlanta and a plurality of Black residents. Democrats and voting groups are suing.'

## [Calmes: The GOP assault on election integrity has already begun](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2024-10-13/election-voter-fraud-pennsylvania)

Opinion by Jackie Calme. October 13, 2024.

- **Election Integrity Concerns**: The Republican National Committee's senior counsel is a defendant in a case involving attempts to overturn the 2020 election results in Arizona.
- **Voting Restrictions**: Since 2020, red states have enacted various voting restrictions under the guise of "election integrity," targeting measures that expand voter participation.
- **Lawsuits and Challenges**: Republicans are pursuing numerous lawsuits to contest local and state election rules, aiming to discard mail-in ballots on technicalities.
- **Election Skeptics**: Trump supporters have gained control of election boards in key states, potentially undermining confidence in future elections.

But here’s the good news: This time Trump isn’t the president, capable of abusing his power to, say, order the Justice Department to intervene or the Pentagon to seize voting machines. And JD Vance won’t be the vice president who presides when Congress certifies the result next Jan. 6.

Let’s keep it that way for the next four years.[^11]

@RalphHightower: **Please!** Our democracy depends upon defeating the Trumpers. Trump is in his twilight years. Insurance ac​tu​ar​i​al​ly, Trump probably wouldn't complete four years. Trump is now the same age as Biden was when he began his term.

America needs a person that is even tempered and not fly off the handle when he perceives somebody did him wrong,
