@RalphHightower: everything in this post came from Wikipedia. Including Trump's **Call To Action** to riot at US Capitol and halt the formality of certifying the election. Your former vice president, Mike Pence, must have been a Boy Scout, attaining the rank of Eagle Scout, because he would not shirk his constitutional duty. You found your perfect sycophant as your vice president candidate. He lies as much as you do.


## [2020 United States presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election?wprov=sfla1)

Starting in December, Trump called for his supporters to stage a massive protest in Washington, D.C., on January 6 to argue against certification of the electoral vote, using tweets such as "Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!"[^11] D.C. police were concerned, and the National Guard was alerted because several rallies in December had turned violent.

[^11]: @RalphHightower: If Trump's "Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!" is in Wikipedia, Trump is sure to be found guilty in the Federal government’s case against Trump.

A December 18 meeting in the White House discussed Michael Flynn's suggestion to overturn the election by invoking martial law and rerunning the election in several swing states under military supervision. Army Secretary Ryan D. McCarthy and Army Chief of Staff General James McConville later issued a joint statement saying: "There is no role for the U.S. military in determining the outcome of an American election." In a December 20 tweet, Trump dismissed accusations that he wanted to declare martial law as "fake news".

In a December 21 news conference, outgoing attorney general William Barr disavowed several actions reportedly being considered by Trump, including seizing voting machines, appointing a special counsel to investigate voter fraud, and appointing one to investigate Hunter Biden.

In the wake of the election, Trump's White House ordered government agencies not to cooperate with the Biden transition team in any way, and the General Services Administration (GSA) refused to formally acknowledge Biden's victory.

Although all major media outlets called the election for Biden on November 7, the head of the General Services Administration (GSA), Trump appointee Emily W. Murphy, refused for over two weeks to certify Biden as the president-elect. Without formal GSA ascertainment of the winner, the official transition process was delayed. On November 23, Murphy acknowledged Biden as the winner and said the Trump administration would begin the transition. Trump said he had instructed his administration to "do what needs to be done" but did not concede, and indicated he would continue his fight to overturn the election results.
