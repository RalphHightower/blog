## Interview segment courtesy of "Morning Joe" with Mika Brzezinski, Stevie Nicks, with Sheryl Crow (10/30/24) on MSNBC 


Women deserve the right to health-care, not dictated by men in legislature, or by men in the courts seated at the judges' chair. Since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, I've read articles that doctors were hamstrung to save a woman's life when terminating a pregnancy the necessary procedure.

Stevie Nicks says she doesn’t have many regrets, but one of them is not voting until she turned 70.

“I never voted until I was 70, but now I regret that, and I regret that and I tell everybody on the stage for the last two years, I regret that,” the now 76-year-old rocker told Mika Brzezinski during an appearance on MSNBC. “And I don’t have very many regrets.”

The singer-songwriter, who joined the segment to discuss her new feminist-forward track “The Lighthouse,” said she holds herself accountable for not exercising her constitutional right, highlighting the myriad of excuses some people make.

“There’s so many reasons; you could say, ‘Well, I didn’t have time’…. In the long run, you didn’t have an hour? You didn’t have an hour of your time that you could have gone and voted?” Nicks explained.

“If you’re going to vote in an election, let it be this one,” Mika Brzezinski said to Nicks.

“Let it be this one,” Nicks agreed.

When asked what others with large platforms can do to amplify the importance of voting, Nicks said use the craft to spread the word.

“Really, if you think about it, no matter who wins — God help us — no matter who wins, it’s not over, right? I mean, the government, whatever, we have to figure out a way to bring back Roe v. Wade. We all had to pick causes. This was the cause I chose. So you know what, at the end of the ’50s and ’60s and going into the ’70s, everybody was writing protest songs: Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Joni Mitchell, Stephen Stills, it was like lots and lots and lots,” – Stevie Nicks

“I’m like, ‘This can’t be happening.’ Fleetwood Mac is three years in. And it’s big. And we’re going into our third album. It was like, ‘Oh no, no, no, no, no, no,’” Nicks said of her surprise pregnancy.

Nicks was in a relationship with Eagles frontman Don Henley at the time. She said, “I would’ve, like, tried my best to get through, you know, being in the studio every single day expecting a child.”

The continued survival of Fleetwood Mac following the group’s landmark 1977 album “Rumours” came down to the fact that Stevie Nicks chose to have an abortion, the singer told CBS Sunday Morning on Sunday.

“I’m like, ‘This can’t be happening.’ Fleetwood Mac is three years in. And it’s big. And we’re going into our third album. It was like, ‘Oh no, no, no, no, no, no,’” Nicks said of her surprise pregnancy.

Nicks was in a relationship with Eagles frontman Don Henley at the time. She said, “I would’ve, like, tried my best to get through, you know, being in the studio every single day expecting a child.”

“But mostly, having a child with Don Henley would not have gone over big in Fleetwood Mac, with Lindsey and me — we had been broken up for two or three years. It would’ve been a nightmare scenario for me to live through,” Nicks added.

The singer was surprised she ended up pregnant because she thought she was “totally protected” by her IUD.

Nicks has been promoting her new song “The Lighthouse,” which was inspired by Nicks’ abortion and the current state of women’s rights after Roe v. Wade was struck down. Described as a “rallying cry” by CBS, Nicks said the song only took her a day to write. She decided to release the song because “everybody kept saying, ‘Well, somebody has to do something. Somebody has to say something” after Roe v. Wade was overturned.

Nicks also spoke about her abortion in an interview with Rolling Stone published last week. “Now what the hell am I going to do? I cannot have a child,” she told the outlet. “I am not the kind of woman who would hand my baby over to a nanny, not in a million years. So we would be dragging a baby around the world on tour, and I wouldn’t do that to my baby. I wouldn’t say I just need nine months. I would say I need a couple of years, and that would break up the band, period. So my decision was to have an abortion.”
