## [Republicans block effort to keep ‘free’ Qatari plane out of Trump’s post-presidency hands](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-block-effort-keep-free-qatari-plane-trumps-post-presidency-rcna222478)

*[Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/)s want to stop [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) from keeping [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/)'s "gift" after he leaves office, but [Republican](https://www.gop.com/)s are standing in the way of the safeguards.*

When [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [accepted](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-admin-accepts-jet-qatar-ignoring-legal-restrictions-bipartisan-p-rcna208306) a superluxury [Boeing](https://www.boeing.com/) [747-8 jumbo jet](https://www.boeing.com/commercial/747-8) from the royal family of [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/), there was [a long list of questions](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-admin-accepts-jet-qatar-ignoring-legal-restrictions-bipartisan-p-rcna208306) about the arrangement, and by any fair measure, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) created a legal, ethical and political mess. But hanging overhead was a related question: What happens to the plane after the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) exits the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)?

The [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s official line has long been the [Qatari](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) aircraft should be seen as a “gift,” not to [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) personally, but to the United States. The same [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s official line has also been that the [not-at-all-free](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/administration-faces-awkward-questions-pay-trumps-free-jet-qatar-rcna221787) jet will apparently head to his [future presidential library](https://www.trumplibrary.gov/).

How does the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) resolve the conflict between the first talking point and the second? So far, by ignoring it.

Some [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Democrats](https://www.democrats.org/), however, came up with a more straightforward idea. [The Washington Post reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/31/trump-presidency-news/#link-YYRSPYACVBCJFIOJTGZYUJBLDQ):

A [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) panel narrowly voted down an amendment Thursday that would prevent the military from transferring a [Qatari](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) jet to be used as Air Force One to [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s future library. The amendment, introduced by Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Delaware), failed on a 14-15 party-line vote before the chamber’s appropriations committee.

As the Connecticut [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) explained in [items published to Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/chrismurphyct.bsky.social/post/3lvbfkjwtys2w), the amendment wouldn’t have changed much in terms of the status quo: The [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) could still accept the plane from [Qatar](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/); it could still take steps to refurbish the jet; it could still move money around to try to pay for it; etc.

What Murphy’s proposal would instead do is prevent the [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) from taking the plane with him at the end of his second term.

“This is an extraordinary amount of money to be used on a plane retrofit that will likely only be in service for a short period of time. Well, the [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/) has essentially refused to brief us on the full cost,” the senator told his colleagues. “Reports are that this number could be easily $1 billion.”

Murphy added, “To most Americans, that’s a lot of their money to be spent on a plane that is not going to be in the service of the [United States military](https://www.jcs.mil/), in the [United States Air Force](https://www.af.mil/), for perhaps any longer than a few months, because the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has, in fact, stated his intention to take this plane with him when he leaves office.”

But when the amendment came up in the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) [Appropriations Committee](), every [Democrat](https://www.democrats.org/) voted for it — and every [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) voted against it.

By way of an explanation, Sen. [Markwayne Mullin (T-OK)](https://www.mullin.senate.gov/), [questioned the premise](https://thehill.com/business/budget/5431133-republicans-reject-democrats-amendment-aimed-at-blocking-trump-from-taking-qatari-jet-post-presidency/), saying, “The [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has never came out and said he’s putting this in the library. He said it in a joke one time.”

To the extent that reality matters, that wasn’t true. The [administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)’s position about the plane and the library has been repeated for months, and there’s never been any indication that the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) was kidding about his intentions.

For that matter, if [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) was just joking around, then what would be the harm in having [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/) impose some restrictions to ensure the plane remains in the public’s hands after January 2029?
