His margin of victory was less than 1.5%, 1.48% to be exact. I don’t give a shit about those election deniers; these are the undisputed numbers as recorded by the Federal Election Commission."

## Resistance Is Not Futile!

### We Are The *"Enemy Within"*

#### Pain Point Issues

*"This is @RalphHightower from Chapin, South Carolina, with the daily farm report. Despite Donald Trump promising to lower the price of eggs as a Day 1 priority and signing an Executive Order ordering chickens to lay cheaper eggs, a dozen Grade A large eggs are \$10 with prices expected to rise. A pound of steaks are \$25 to \$30. It is now Day ## of the Trump presidency. It sounds like Trump’s campaign promises are from a car salesperson: **Bait and Switch**. This concludes today’s farm market report from Chapin, South Carolina, with Ralph Hightower reporting."*

Grade A large Eggs \$8 dozen
Steak \$20 pound
Inflation rising
Weekly unemployment highest since last January
Stock market down
Enemies with our allies
Friends with our enemies

### Election Results

[Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/) did not win by a mandate. He did not cross over 50% in 2024 or 2016, although he got 9 more electoral votes the third time around. His margin of victory was less than 1.5%, 1.48% to be exact.

## Game Plan Strategy

@RalphHightower: What's below the chapter headings are summaries of the chapters. Click on the headings to read the full chapters.

### [Indivisible](https://indivisible.org/)

*Our democracy is under threat. But we will not yield to fascism. We will stand together, and we'll fight back in defense of our rights, our communities, and our values. Join us.*

#### INDIVISIBLE: A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO DEMOCRACY ON THE BRINK.

*Strategies, Tactics, & Tips For How Everyday Americans Can Fight Back Together Wherever We Live*

##### [Chapter 1: What Happened and Why it Matters](https://indivisible.org/resource/guide#chapter1)

> Heading into the 2024 election, Americans were angry about inflation and frustrated with the status quo. Some voters either flipped to Trump or didn’t vote at all. That gave Trump the margins to win — but it doesn’t give him a mandate for dictatorship or Project 2025. Americans of all stripes are going to be pissed when Trump 2.0 comes to town dressed in chaos, corruption, and cruelty. We can stoke that backlash to break up their coalition and build ours.

##### [Chapter 2: A Quick Primer on Constituent Power](https://indivisible.org/resource/guide#chapter2)

> Trump wants us to believe that the presidency is all-powerful. It ain’t true. Political power in our democracy overlaps between local, state, and federal electeds. Your power comes from your ability to be a source of support (or a pain in the ass) to those electeds. You can use this power to get them to stand up to Trump 2.0 or face political consequences. We review the basics of constituent power — what it is, how it works, and how yours can do the most good in this moment where you live.

##### [Chapter 3: The Plan to Get Through the Next 2 Years](https://indivisible.org/resource/guide#chapter3)

> Our best chance to get through this era with some amount of democracy intact is to hang on until 2026 and win big in the midterms — breaking Trump’s hold on Congress and making sure election deniers and saboteurs aren’t in charge of the 2028 election. We’ve boiled it down to three big plays:

> 1. We will all throw in to say NO to the Project 2025 agenda pushed by the White House and Congress. We’ll stop what we can and pick strategic fights to drive national backlash to win in 2026.
> 2. We will play hardball wherever we’ve got Democrats in local, city, or state office — pushing them to block, delay, and challenge MAGA’s attacks.
> 3. We will work to protect and win elections — defending against election deniers in swing states and turning all that national backlash into an electoral majority coalition that delivers big wins in 2026.

> You’ll plug into the plays that make the most sense for where you live and the leverage you have. Think of it as a giant national pro-democracy team — some of us are playing offense, some are playing defense, but if we all play our roles, we’ll make it through together.

##### [Chapter 4: Protect and Prepare](https://indivisible.org/resource/guide#chapter4)

> Things are about to get much worse, and we need to treat an attack on one as an attack on all of us. That means supporting communities under threat and preparing to operate under increasingly authoritarian conditions. We’ll review how to:
> 1. Organize to Protect Communities Under Threat. MAGA will hit hard, and we’ll need to stand together.
> 2. Operate Under Authoritarian Creep. We’re not giving up on democracy, but we are not naive about what we face. We’ll cover lessons learned about operating under increasingly authoritarian conditions.

##### [Chapter 5: Practical steps for finding or forming your local Indivisible group](https://indivisible.org/resource/guide#chapter5)

> Fascists depend on you, believing you’re alone and powerless. And honestly, on your own, you don’t have a ton of power. But, organized groups of individuals do have power. If you’re a fan of an existing group in your area, join it. If not, get a few friends together, start a new local Indivisible group, and build from there. Your local group is the basis for everything else you can hope to achieve in this period. This chapter includes some starter recommendations for how to pull your new, local, volunteer-led Indivisible group together, connect with others on the ground, and get to work.

### Advice From a High-Level Staffer For a Senator

FOR THOSE OF YOU LOOKING TO TURN YOUR despair INTO ACTION, here's some advice from a high-level staffer for a Senator.

There are two things that we should be doing all the time right now. You should NOT be bothering with online petitions or emailing.

1. The best thing you can do to be heard and get your congressperson to pay attention is to have face-to-face time — if they have town halls, go to them. Go to their local offices. If you're in DC, try to find a way to go to an event of theirs. Go to the "mobile offices" that their staff hold periodically (all these times are located on each congressperson's website). When you go, ask questions. A lot of them. And push for answers. The louder and more vocal and present you can be at those the better
2. But those in-person events don't happen every day. So, the absolute most important thing that people should be doing every day is calling.

YOU SHOULD MAKE 6 CALLS A DAY:
2 each (DC office and your local office) to your 2 Senators & your 1 Representative.

The staffer was very clear that any sort of online contact basically gets immediately ignored, and letters pretty much get thrown in the trash (unless you have a particularly strong emotional story — but even then it's not worth the time it took you to craft that letter).

Calls are what all the congresspeople pay attention to. Every single day, the Senior Staff and the Senator get a report of the 3 most-called-about topics for that day at each of their offices (in DC and local offices), and exactly how many people said what about each of those topics. They're also sorted by zip code and area code. She said that Republican callers generally outnumber Democrat callers 4-1, and when it's a particular issue that single-issue-voters pay attention to (like ~~gun control~~[^71], or planned parenthood funding, etc...), it's often closer to 11-1, and that's recently pushed Republican congressmen on the fence to vote with the Republicans. In the last 8 years, Republicans have called, and Democrats haven't.

Areas of concern:
- Egg prices
- Gas prices
- Inflation
- Unemployment
- [Elon Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/) has unfettered access to government computer systems that contain Personal Identifiable Information (PII) such as [Social Security](https://www.ssa.gov/) numbers, health information information protected by the [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/laws-regulations/index.html). He and his [Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)](https://doge.gov/), a high school graduate, and college students bulldozed their way into government computer systems, including the federal government payment system.

[^71]: @RalphHightower: Forget it. Despite all the commercials on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/), Trumpian legislators ain't gonna budge.

When you call:

- When calling the DC office, ask for the Staff member in charge of whatever you're calling about ("Hi, I'd like to speak with the staffer in charge of Healthcare, please") — local offices won't always have specific ones, but they might. If you get transferred to that person, awesome. If you don't, that's ok — ask for that person's name, and then just keep talking to whoever answered the phone. Don't leave a message (unless the office doesn't pick up at all — then you can — but it's better to talk to the staffer who first answered than leave a message for the specific staffer in charge of your topic).
- Give them your zip code. They won't always ask for it, but make sure you give it to them, so they can mark it down. Extra points if you live in a zip code that traditionally votes for them, since they'll want to make sure they get/keep your vote.
- If you can make it personal, make it personal. "I voted for you in the last election and I'm worried/happy/whatever" or "I'm a teacher, and I am appalled by ——-," or "as a single mother" or "as a white, middle class woman," or whatever.
- Pick 1-2 specific things per day to focus on. Don't rattle off everything you're concerned about — they're figuring out what 1-2 topics to mark you down for on their lists. So, focus on 1-2 per day. Ideally something that will be voted on/taken up in the next few days, but it doesn't really matter — even if there's not a vote coming up in the next week, call anyway. It's important that they just keep getting calls.
- Be clear on what you want — "I'm disappointed that the Senator..." or "I want to thank the Senator for their vote on... " or "I want the Senator to know that voting in _____ way is the wrong decision for our state because... " Don't leave any ambiguity.
- They may get to know your voice/get sick of you — it doesn't matter. The people answering the phones generally turn over every 6 weeks anyway, so even if they're really sick of you, they'll be gone in 6 weeks.

From experience since the election: If you hate being on the phone & feel awkward (which is a lot of people) don't worry about it — there are a bunch of scripts (Indivisible has some, there are lots of others floating around these day). After a few days of calling, it starts to feel a lot more natural.

Put the 6 numbers in your phone (all under P – Politician.) An example is Politican Wilson DC, Politician McCaskill DC, Politician Blunt MO, etc., which makes it really easy to click down the list each day.
