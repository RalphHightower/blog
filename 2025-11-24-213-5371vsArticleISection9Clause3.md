Hi, my name is Ralph Hightower, a Constituent from Chapin, South Carolina. Do you have a pen and paper handy? Great!

Write this down: "Section 213 of HR5371", the next to write down is: "Article I, Section 9, Clause 3 of the Constitution".

Our Founding Fathers wrote a legal tripwire in the Constitution. They wrote "No Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed." Ex Post Facto prohibits writing retroactive laws. Section 213 of the Continuing Resolution is a "Back To The Future" Paradox.

If I did something that was legal in 2022 and government makes it illegal in 2025 and makes it retroactive to 2022, can I be prosecuted for my past legal action?

213 allows eight senators whose call records were subpoenaed as part of the Department of Justice Special Counsel investigation into the 2020 election interference and January 6 Insurrection to sue the government for $500,000. Senator Graham in on record in the media as a "Hell yes, I going to sue them! I did nothing wrong!"

The Associated Press reported in November 2022 that Georgia Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, reported that Senator Graham called him asking Georgia to throw out mail-in ballots. 

Senator Graham has January 6 amnesia.
