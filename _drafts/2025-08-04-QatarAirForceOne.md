Let me see if I get this right. It's going to take at least a billion dollars, and one to two years, to bring the Qatari jumbo jet to Air Force One standards. The Pentagon is going to divert one billion dollars from the upgrades to the nuclear missile silos to retrofit the Qatari jet. President Trump will have only a years use of the plane once it's ready. Senator Chris Murphy put forth an amendment in the 2026 Defense Appropriations for the Air Force to retain the jet after Trump leaves office, but that was shot down. After his term is over, he gets to keep the jet to fly around and later park it at his presidential library. Meanwhile, the 48th president uses the 40 year old 747. That one billion for the missile silos upgrades will need a billion dollars to replace what the retrofit took and the replacement 747s for Air Force One and Two will have to continue for #48. The price of the new Air Force One and Two just went up by three billion dollars!

That's insane! That's effing madness. Please tell me before Trump flies that jet as a former president, that the avionics upgrades and defensive measures will be removed.
