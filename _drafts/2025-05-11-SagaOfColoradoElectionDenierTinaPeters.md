## [Colorado AG calls Trump DOJ’s interest in 2020 election case a ‘naked, political attempt’](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/tina-peters-trump-doj-colorado-attorney-general-rcna196091)

*[Colorado](https://co.colorado.gov/)’s [attorney general](https://www.coag.gov/) said the federal government’s intervention in a state criminal case is “a grotesque attempt to weaponize the rule of law.”*

March 12, 2025, 4:29 PM EDT
By [Jordan Rubin](https://www.msnbc.com/author/jordan-rubin-ncpn1301611)

The word “unprecedented” has appeared [in legal filings](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/judge-beryl-howell-trump-nlrb-firing-rcna195222) to describe more than one of [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s actions in the opening days of his second term. Ditto [alleged attacks on the rule of law](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/donald-trump-executive-order-perkins-coie-rcna196030).

One of the latest examples presenting both claims comes in response to the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/)’s bid to intervene in the [Colorado](https://co.colorado.gov/) state criminal case of [Tina Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterstina/). She’s the former county clerk who was [convicted and sentenced to nine years](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/justice-department-takes-interest-tina-peters-conviction-colorado-rcna194675) in prison for tampering with voting machines in a failed bid to prove they were used to rig the [2020 election]({% link  %}) against [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).

So, what does the federal government have to do with this case?

Arguably nothing.

But the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) still filed a “statement of interest” in [Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterstina/)’ case, in which the government requested “prompt and careful consideration” of her claims. The [government’s filing](https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/03/gov.uscourts.cod_.241206.16.0.pdf) last week said “[r]easonable concerns have been raised about various aspects of [Ms. Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterstina/)’ case,” citing, among other things, her “exceptionally lengthy sentence” and the [First Amendment](). The filing also said the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) is reviewing cases across the country “for abuses of the criminal justice process” and that [Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterstina/)’ case will be included in that review.

[Colorado](https://co.colorado.gov/) [Attorney General](https://coag.gov/) [Philip Weiser](https://coag.gov/about-us/colorado-attorney-general/)’s office responded to the statement on Tuesday. [He called](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cod.241206/gov.uscourts.cod.241206.17.0.pdf) the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/)’s “unprecedented and extraordinary” intervention “a naked, political attempt to threaten or intimidate either this Court or the attorneys that prosecuted this matter.” He further noted that the federal statement “cites not a single fact to support its baseless allegations that there are any reasonable concerns about Ms. [Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterstina/)’ prosecution or sentence, or that the prosecution was politically motivated in any way.”

“Rather,” [Weiser](https://coag.gov/about-us/colorado-attorney-general/) said in the filing signed by [state solicitor general]() [Shannon Stevenson](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-supreme-court-ballot-hearing-lawyers-rcna137687), “what appears ‘politically motivated’ — and a grotesque attempt to weaponize the rule of law — is the very statement the United States has filed.”

The state said it’s “unnecessary and unwarranted” for the federal government to weigh in here because it has an interest in fairness in all cases but “has singled out this case in which to wield its power for the benefit of a party who has aligned herself politically with the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).”

While the [Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterstina/) matter is pending, the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) administration is separately defending his executive order [targeting a disfavored law firm](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/donald-trump-executive-order-perkins-coie-rcna196030) in [Washington, D.C.](https://dc.gov/), as we await word from a federal judge in New York on the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/)’s [quest to dismiss](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-supreme-court-eric-adams-deadline-newsletter-rcna195305) [New York]() [Mayor]() [Eric Adams]()’ case in a way that would give the [Republican]() [administration]() continued leverage over the [Democrat](). Against that backdrop and the rest of the administration’s actions in this nascent term and [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [first one](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/), the [Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterstina/) intervention seems to fit well within his view of “law and order.”

## [The Justice Department takes an interest in Tina Peters’ conviction in Colorado](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/justice-department-takes-interest-tina-peters-conviction-colorado-rcna194675)

*Tina Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterstina/) was sent to prison after acting on Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s 2020 election lies. Now, Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) is intervening in her case without cause.*

The [NBC affiliate]() in [Denver]() ran [a strange story](https://www.9news.com/video/news/local/next/next-with-kyle-clark/republicans-call-for-pausing-federal-funds-to-colorado-unless-governor-pardons-tina-peters/73-26276b13-6482-45d6-9cae-3f8271647bfa) last week about a group of [Republicans]() in [Colorado](https://co.colorado.gov/) who came up with an unusual request for the [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [administration](). According to [the local report](https://www.9news.com/video/news/local/next/next-with-kyle-clark/republicans-call-for-pausing-federal-funds-to-colorado-unless-governor-pardons-tina-peters/73-26276b13-6482-45d6-9cae-3f8271647bfa), these GOP officials envision a scheme in which the White House agrees to block funding for the Rocky Mountain State until [Colorado](https://co.colorado.gov/)’s Democratic governor, Jared Polis, agrees to pardon a convicted criminal named Tina Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterstina/).

It was, to be sure, a bizarre pitch, which will not and cannot happen, but it was a timely reminder that for some on the far-right, Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterstina/)’ case remains highly relevant. In fact, [The New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/us/politics/tina-peters-clerk-election-trump.html) reported that even Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) has apparently taken an interest in the matter.

The [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) said on Monday that it would review the conviction of the former clerk of Mesa County, Colo., who was found guilty of state charges last summer of tampering with voting machines under her control in a failed attempt to prove that they had been used to rig the 2020 election against [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/). The decision was the latest example of the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) under Mr. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s control seeking to use its powers to support those who have acted on his behalf and to go after those who have criticized or opposed him.

While the Times’ report hasn’t been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, the developments are not the subject of rumor or scuttlebutt: The article specifically noted that the acting assistant attorney general for the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/)’s civil division unexpectedly filed a brief in federal court this week, declaring that “reasonable concerns have been raised about various aspects of Ms. Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterstina/)’s case.”

At this point, some readers might be thinking, “Her name sounds familiar, but I’m not quite sure who Tina Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterstina/) is.” With this in mind, let’s take a stroll down memory lane.

Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterstina/) was a county clerk in [Colorado](https://co.colorado.gov/) who eagerly embraced Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s lies and conspiracy theories about his 2020 election defeat, but that’s not all she did. Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterstina/) also acted on those lies and conspiracy theories, using someone’s security badge to allow a Mike Lindell associate to access county election equipment.

The apparent point of the endeavor was to leak election machinery data in pursuit of a conspiratorial plot that never existed in reality.

Not surprisingly, Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterstina/) was caught and indicted. She pleaded not guilty, but after she and her attorney struggled to present a compelling defense, a [Colorado](https://co.colorado.gov/) jury convicted Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterstina/), finding her guilty of three counts of attempting to influence a public servant, one count of conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation, first-degree official misconduct, violation of duty and failing to comply with the secretary of state.

Ahead of sentencing, Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterstina/) [showed no remorse](https://x.com/RonFilipkowski/status/1841911266526306526). A judge ultimately sentenced her to [nine years behind bars](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/election-denying-ex-county-clerk-receives-9-year-prison-sentence-rcna173916).

This was a state official, charged with state crimes, by state prosecutors, in a state court, with a state jury, overseen by a state judge. What did the case have to do with federal law enforcement? Literally nothing.

And yet, six weeks into the Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) administration, the Republican-led [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/) is nevertheless taking an interest in the case

The scrutiny of Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterstina/) case, according to Yaakov Roth, the acting assistant attorney general for the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/)’s civil division, was an extension of the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s executive order related to ending the “weaponization of the federal government.”

But this turns reality on its head. The [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/)’s unwarranted intervention in this case serves as a timely reminder that, in 2025, federal law enforcement is focused on the interests of Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s friends and allies.

The brazenness is so plainly ridiculous, the Republican administration is hardly even trying to keep up appearances, and there’s every reason to believe this will get worse in the coming days, weeks, months and years.

*Plenty of election officials who bought into Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s election lies, but [Colorado](https://co.colorado.gov/)'s Tina Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterstina/), who's headed to prison, is a special case.*

There’s no shortage of local election officials who bought into Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s lies about his 2020 election defeat, but by any fair measure, Tina Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterstina/) is a special case. Indeed, as [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/election-denying-ex-county-clerk-sentenced-9-years-tampering-election-rcna173807), the [Colorado](https://co.colorado.gov/) Republican is now headed to prison.

A former [Colorado](https://co.colorado.gov/) county clerk who promoted 2020 election conspiracy theories was sentenced Thursday to 9 years behind bars for charges including official misconduct in connection with a security breach of Mesa County’s voting system. Tina Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterstina/) was convicted of four felony and three misdemeanor charges in August for using another person’s security badge to allow someone associated with MyPillow founder Mike Lindell, a prominent election denier and ally of former [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), access to county election equipment.

As a local prosecutor explained, Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterstina/) was “a fox guarding the henhouse,” adding, “It was her job to protect the election equipment, and she turned on it and used her power for her own advantage.”

It’s been more than two years since the GOP conspiracy theorist was [first indicted](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/election-security-breach-grand-jury-indicts-tina-peters-rcna19470) after she used her office to help leak election machinery data in pursuit of a conspiratorial plot that apparently never existed in reality.

As part of her efforts, Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterstina/) was celebrated by the likes of Steve Bannon — [he argued](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/14/us/tina-peters-colorado-election.html) that she was targeted because of her fight against “this globalist apparatus” — though a [Colorado](https://co.colorado.gov/) jury came to a different conclusion, [convicting the election denier in early August](https://www.msnbc.com/politics/politics-news/ex-colorado-clerk-tina-peters-one-time-hero-election-deniers-convicted-rcna166337) in early August, finding her guilty of three counts of attempting to influence a public servant, one count of conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation, first-degree official misconduct, violation of duty and failing to comply with the secretary of state.

Ahead of sentencing, Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterstina/) [showed no remorse](https://x.com/RonFilipkowski/status/1841911266526306526).

As the notorious election denier begins her sentence, there are a couple of broader angles to this that are worth keeping in mind. The first is the election season message this sends to other right-wing conspiracy theorists elsewhere.

“Today’s verdict is a warning to others that they will face serious consequences if they attempt to illegally tamper with our voting processes or election systems,” [Colorado](https://co.colorado.gov/) [Attorney General](https://coag.gov/) Phil Weiser](https://coag.gov/about-us/colorado-attorney-general/) [said in a statement](https://www.msnbc.com/politics/politics-news/ex-colorado-clerk-tina-peters-one-time-hero-election-deniers-convicted-rcna166337) after Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterstina/)’ conviction.

It’s not exactly a secret that there are plenty of conspiratorial election officials considering provocative and legally dubious steps this fall. Whether the developments in [Colorado](https://co.colorado.gov/) get their attention remains to be seen.

But I’m also struck by the broader partisan circumstances: Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) lied, and Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterstina/) took those lies seriously. Nearly four years later, she’s headed to a prison cell, while there’s a decent chance that he’s headed back to the Oval Office.

## [Following election security breach, grand jury indicts Tina Peters](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/election-security-breach-grand-jury-indicts-tina-peters-rcna19470)

*There’s no shortage of local election officials who bought into the Big Lie, but by any fair measure, [Colorado](https://co.colorado.gov/)'s [Tina Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterstina/) is a special case.*

March 10, 2022, 8:42 AM EST

There’s no shortage of local election officials who bought into Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s Big Lie about his 2020 defeat, but by any fair measure, Tina Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterstina/) is a special case. Indeed, as NBC News [reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/colorado-county-clerk-tina-peters-indicted-election-security-breach-rcna19355) yesterday, the [Colorado](https://co.colorado.gov/) Republican is now under indictment.

A grand jury in [Colorado](https://co.colorado.gov/) has indicted Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterstina/) on counts related to a probe into alleged election equipment tampering and official misconduct. Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterstina/) was indicted on felony and misdemeanor charges connected to an investigation into an election security breach in the county’s office last year. Belinda Knisley, Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterstina/)’ deputy, was also indicted.

The fact that Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterstina/) has run into legal trouble may sound familiar, but yesterday’s developments were new. It was last month when the county clerk [was detained](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/14/us/tina-peters-colorado-election.html) by law enforcement when she obstructed efforts to serve a search warrant for her iPad.

The grand jury indictment is vastly more serious: Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterstina/) is now facing 10 counts, including attempting to influence a public servant, criminal impersonation, conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation, identity theft, official misconduct, violation of duty, and failing to comply with the secretary of state.

At the heart of the controversy are allegations that Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterstina/), in her capacity as a local county clerk, may have helped leak election machinery data, in pursuit of broader far-right conspiracy theories. Talking Points Memo published [a good summary](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/mesa-county-colorado-clerk-tina-peters-indicted-big-lie-election-data-leak) of the story yesterday:

According to the indictment, Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterstina/) and [her deputy Belinda Knisley] allegedly devised and executed a scheme to breach security protocols that led to the distribution of confidential information from county election systems. And to carry out the scheme, the indictment alleged, Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterstina/) committed criminal impersonation against a [Colorado](https://co.colorado.gov/) man whose name was used for an access badge for county election offices.

Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterstina/) has denied wrongdoing and has claimed she’s trying to expose a larger conspiracy involving voting machines.

As part of her efforts, the [Colorado](https://co.colorado.gov/) Republican has been celebrated by the likes of Steve Bannon — he’s [argued](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/14/us/tina-peters-colorado-election.html) that Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterstina/) has been targeted because of her fight against “this globalist apparatus” — and has been promoted by MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell.

And in case this weren’t quite enough, Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterstina/) last month launched a GOP campaign to become [Colorado](https://co.colorado.gov/)’s secretary of state. If she wins, this would put Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterstina/) in a position to help supervise the state’s elections.

She has not yet received any endorsements from national party leaders.
