## [The United States is now an emerging market. Invest accordingly. / Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20250410726/the-united-states-is-now-an-emerging-market-invest-accordingly)

On the contrary, high-risk emerging and frontier markets can produce spectacular returns. You think the U.S. stock market has been on a tear for a decade? Romania has been better. So has Slovenia. So have Lebanon and Kazakhstan. You've tripled your money on the Kazakh stock market in the past decade, according to data provider MSCI.

But emerging and frontier markets are also risky and volatile. You can never be sure what you're really going to get. One day the caudillo and his junta say they have decided to return the country's trade policies to the 1880s, and announce they are declaring economic war against the rest of the world. Then a week later they announce they have called it off - after first tipping off investors on the caudillo's personal information and news service. In an emerging or frontier market, nobody expects the official spokesperson for the junta to tell the truth.

As a result of these risks, emerging and frontier stock markets are typically cheap. The Romanian stock market currently sells for nine times forecast earnings for the next 12 months, SG Securities tells me. Colombian stocks sell for an average of eight times forecast earnings. And Hungary and Turkey, both run by their own so-called strongmen: less than seven times earnings.

Overall, emerging-market stocks worldwide sell for an average of around 13 times forecast per-share earnings, SG calculates.

The U.S.? Somewhere between 20 and 25 times, depending on how you calculate it.

It makes no sense. Not only is the U.S. market grossly expensive compared with (other) emerging markets; it's also expensive compared with developed markets. You know - places that have political checks and balances, legislators who turn up for work, political leaders bound by laws, rules and civilized norms, and where they don't put budget policy in the hands of a guy waving a chainsaw in the air. Developed markets trade for just 13 times forecast earnings, according to SG data.

In other words, the U.S. is now an emerging market that sells for about 50% more than developed markets.

I don't know if stocks in places like Japan and Singapore and Australia and Switzerland and Germany and France and Britain and Sweden will generate higher returns than those in the U.S. in the years ahead. But I know they are much cheaper. And it's pretty apparent now that they will entail a lot less risk.

I don't invest where there isn't the rule of law. And I don't want to invest in a country where the market is being controlled by a caudillo and his cabal, and in order to make money I need to sign up for their for-profit information service to get inside stock tips before they change government policy.

Thanks. But no thanks.
