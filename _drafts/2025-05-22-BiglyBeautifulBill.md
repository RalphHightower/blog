Dear Senator Graham,
Dear Senator Scott,

I am writing as a deeply concerned constituent regarding the provisions of H.R. 1. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office’s summary—condensing over 1,000 pages down to 3 key pages—reveals that the Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) mechanism would automatically trigger cuts to Medicare. This outcome jeopardizes the healthcare of millions of seniors.

Furthermore, recent market reactions raise additional concerns. During Trump’s “Liberation Day,” significant market turbulence prompted Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to warn that Treasury securities were not behaving as expected. Shortly thereafter, headlines such as “The United States is now an emerging market” on MarketWatch, and further analyses from Morningstar, highlight a growing perception among international investors that the U.S. is losing its safe-haven status. This not only undermines market confidence but risks increasing our borrowing costs at a time when our national debt is rapidly expanding.

I respectfully urge you to oppose any aspects of H.R. 1 that would force automatic cuts to Medicare or exacerbate our already precarious fiscal situation. Our nation’s long-term stability and the well-being of our seniors depend on thoughtful policymaking that balances fiscal responsibility with essential social services.

Thank you for your attention to these critical issues.

Sincerely,
Ralph Hightower
Chapin, SC 29036
