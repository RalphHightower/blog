*[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s trips to [Winter White House](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) gather scrutiny amid slashing of federal jobs, programs by [Elon Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) and his [DOGE](https://www.doge.gov/).*

Palm Beach Post

March 7, 2025

Amid a firestorm of debate over unprecedented deep slashing of federal spending, [President Donald Trump's](https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/trump/2025/02/28/trump-mulls-mexico-canada-tariffs-at-mar-a-lago-as-ukraine-talks-crash/80841823007/) planned fifth [trip to his Palm Beach](https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/trump/2025/03/05/faa-trump-visit-mar-a-lago-in-palm-beach-jan-20/81576345007/) private club raises a question: How much are his frequent [travels here](https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/trump/2025/02/27/trump-to-visit-mar-a-lago-for-fourth-time-in-second-term-as-president/80683145007/) costing U.S. taxpayers?

The answer is there is not an up-to-date, publicly-released tally of expenses, nor even all-encompassing line items that are presented each fiscal year. Instead, government watchdogs simply look at the various uses, such as travel on [Air Force One](), security protection, etc., to calculate and surmise more or less what a [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) travel budget might look like.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s supporters in the [Make America Great Again](https://www.gop.com/) movement, as well as his [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) supporters in [Congress](https://www.congress.gov/), frequently point out [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) works on his trips to the [Winter White House](https://www.maralagoclub.com/). And they add that U.S. [presidents](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) of both parties have engaged in travel that crossed the line from governance to personal. To that end, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s trips, they say, are no departure from the habits of other modern [presidents](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).

There is truth to that, but neither did [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s predecessors sought to indiscriminately slash hundreds of billions of dollars, if not $2 trillion, from the federal government's budget as [Elon Musk](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate/elon-musk) and his [DOGE squad](https://www.doge.gov/) are pursuing. Which is why the weekend travels are again drawing scrutiny.

Especially as tens of thousands of federal workers have lost their jobs and many more are at risk of losing their employment. Federal programs are also being severely curtailed and the entire [U.S. Department of Education](https://www.ed.gov/) is reportedly on the chopping block.

Watchdogs who in the past have attempted to guesstimate [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) trips have generally poured through government expenditures to isolate those balance sheet entries that pertain to presidential travel.

So the question is: How much is [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) spending on his weekend sojourns? Here are seven things to know so you can do the math.

#### Air Force One

The cost to operate the 747 military aircraft is around $200,000 per hour. The flight time from [Washington, D.C.](), to [Palm Beach International Airport]() is about two hours. So that's $800,000 per trip to South Florida, assuming it's a direct flight from [Washington]() to [Palm Beach County]().

#### Security around [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/)

It is far from clear what is spent on security around the [Winter White House](). Newsweek reported on March 5 that just one government procurement contract for security at [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) last month came in at $478,000.

#### Other security in the West Palm Beach area

Newsweek also reported that procurement contracts were awarded to an [Illinois]()-based event management and perimeter security company. Newsweek said that days before Election Day 2024, the [Secret Service]() spent $1.7 million for this company to provide "perimeter assets" at an undisclosed location in the [West Palm Beach]() area.

While in town, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) spends time at his [Trump International Golf Club]() in unincorporated [West Palm Beach](), scene of an assassination attempt last September, so security considerations are at play there, too.

#### Winter White House charges?

It is not known if [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) is again billing the U.S. government for providing space and services to employees while [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is at the [Winter White House](). The non-partisan [Government Accountability Office]() reported in 2019 that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) billed the government $60,000 for trips taken between early February and March 2017, during his first White House term.

#### Palm Beach County security costs

There is a local cost, too. [Palm Beach County]() officials recently revealed they had incurred tens of millions of dollars in presidential security-related costs, too. They are asking the [federal government]() to reimburse those expenses.

#### Cargo planes, motorcade costs

There are a lot of other factors to include, including the [Air Force cargo planes]() that bring motorcade vehicles to [Palm Beach County](). And the costs of operating "The Beast" limousine and other vehicles.

#### Marine One helicopter

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) rarely requires the use of the [Marine One helicopter]() while in Palm Beach. But when he does, the [Sikorsky helicopters]() cost between $16,700 and almost $20,000 per hour, according to [Pentagon]() data for the 2022 budget year cited by the [Associated Press]().

### [Trump and Air Force One to Mar-a-Lago, Florida: How much does it cost?](https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/2025/04/11/trump-air-force-one-mar-lago-florida-how-much-cost-boeing/82753367007/)

*What does '[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) and [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) travel budget' look like? Since Jan. 20, 2025, president will have returned to home state of [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/) 10 times.*

It's in the six-figures range ... per hour.

[Air Force One is one of two](https://www.palmbeachpost.com/picture-gallery/news/2025/04/03/trump-air-force-one-photos-melania-elon-mar-lago-florida/82755277007/) official presidential airplanes. Both planes are [Boeing 747-200]()s. When [President Donald Trump flies on one, it's called Air Force One](https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/2025/02/03/trumps-air-force-one-jet-color-boeing-elon-musk/78176413007/). When [Vice President JD Vance]() flies on one, it's called Air Force Two.

So far in his second term as commander-in-chief, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has used [Air Force One]() for frequent trips to his home and private club, [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) in [Palm Beach](), [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/), and several high-profile sporting events − in and out of the [Sunshine State]().

On Friday, April 11, [Trump will return to his home state](https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/2025/04/08/trump-golf-florida-melania-ivanka-barron-mar-lago-elon-protest/82969271007/) of [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/) for the 10th time since he was sworn in. His latest visit includes a trip to [Miami]() as well as [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/), [according to the Palm Beach Daily News](https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/trump/2025/04/09/new-faa-notices-provide-more-details-about-trump-visit-to-palm-beach/83006095007/), a [USA TODAY]() Network newspaper.

Last week, in particular, was significant for his presidency: [Trump managed a golf trifecta](https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/2025/04/07/trump-golf-florida-melania-ivanka-barron-bettina-elon-musk-protests/82623873007/) — he attended, played or competed at all three of his [Trump National Golf Club]() sites in [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/) — after arriving April 3, 2025, for a four-day stay in his home state.

It was his ninth visit to [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/) and the eighth to [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) in [Palm Beach]() since his second term began [Jan. 20, 2025](), or Inauguration Day. [Trump National Doral Golf Club]() in [Miami](), where he appeared, also hosted the [Saudi-backed LIV Golf tournament](https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/sports/pga/2025/04/03/liv-golf-miami-ceo-scott-oneil-new-slogan/82794814007/).

In the same weekend, protesters nationwide converged in about 1,300 [Trump-Elon Musk "Hands Off, Fight Back" rallies](https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/2025/04/05/hands-off-protests-trump-elon-musk-florida-what-we-know/82878413007/), with 45 in [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/) alone and some [down the road from Mar-a-Lago](https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/local/pbgardens/2025/04/04/trump-musk-protest-hands-off-palm-beach-gardens-barnes-noble/82847748007/). A big theme was reaction to his "Liberation Day" tariffs, announced April 2, 2025, which caused a two-day Wall Street panic in the country's equity markets. The stock exchanges, repositories for the savings and retirement accounts for 62% of Americans, lost roughly $6 trillion in valuation that weekend.

1If you're keeping track, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has spent all but two weekends of his presidency so far in [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/). When he does arrive here, his supporters and protesters have been known to line up along Southern Boulevard to watch his presidential motorcade enter or leave [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) when [Air Force One]() touches down at [Palm Beach International Airport]().

Below is more information about [Air Force One](), how much it costs to operate the [Boeing 747]() and what to know about [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s usage of the iconic plane.

#### How much money does it cost for President Donald Trump to fly Air Force One?

[Air Force One]() is one of two official presidential airplanes. Both planes are Boeing 747-200s.

Air Force One is a highly secure, mobile command center for the U.S. president, equipped with advanced communication systems, medical facilities, and defensive technology, according to the Air Force.

The cost to operate the Boeing 747 military aircraft is about $200,000 per hour, according to a March 7, 2025, Palm Beach Post story on presidential travel. The flight time from Washington, D.C., to Palm Beach International Airport (PBI) in Palm Beach, Florida, is about two hours. So that's $800,000 for every trip to South Florida, assuming it's a direct flight from Washington to Palm Beach County.

#### It costs $200,000 per hour to operate presidential airplane Air Force One

There is not an up-to-date, publicly-released tally of expenses, nor even all-encompassing line items that are presented each fiscal year. Instead, government watchdogs simply look at the various uses, such as travel on Air Force One, security protection, etc., to calculate and surmise more or less what a "Trump and Mar-a-Lago travel budget" might look like.

According to Palm Beach Post coverage, it costs about $200,000 per hour to operate the Boeing 747 military aircraft, Air Force One.

Before Air Force One arrives, a Lockheed C-5M Super Galaxy, one of the largest airplanes in the world, arrives carrying the presidential helicopter, called Marine One when the president rides in it, as well as presidential SUVs and other items needed by the president and his entourage each time he visits.

There are a lot of other factors to include, including the [Air Force cargo planes]() that bring motorcade vehicles to [Palm Beach County](), [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/). And the costs of operating ">The Beast]()" limousine and other vehicles.

#### Is Air Force One escorted by fighter jets?

The aircraft is often accompanied by fighter jets, such as [F-16]()s or [F-22 Raptors](), for additional protection.

These jets are deployed to ensure the safety of the president, intercepting any potential threats. [Air Force One]()’s combination of advanced technology and military support makes it one of the most secure aircraft in the world, capable of keeping the president operational even in emergencies.

#### What are the features of Air Force One?

As a businessman, [Trump ](https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/trump/2025/01/30/president-donald-trump-live-florida-mar-a-lago-air-force-one/78020198007/) flew on his personal airplane, a Boeing 757 with a "[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)" logo on it. Some call it "[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) Force One."

The current presidential aircraft has an iconic look, colored mostly robin egg blue, with the presidential seal on it.

According to the [Air Force](), the planes have an executive suite with a stateroom that includes a dressing room, bathroom and shower and the [president]()'s office. There's a conference/dining room for the [president](), his family and staff and eating areas for up to 100 meals in one sitting. There are also accommodations for guests, senior staff, [Secret Service](), security personnel and the media.

On occasion, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) will make statements to the news media onboard in his office on [Air Force One]() (see photo gallery with this story) or in the doorway of his office.

In 2023, then-[President Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) chose a light-blue paint scheme. [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has said he wants a red, white and blue design for [Air Force One](). In fact, during his Jan. 20, 2025, inaugural ball, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) uses a sword to cut a cake adorned with a model of his "new" plane [Air Force One](), sporting the red-white-and-blue colors.

Later that month, while aboard [Air Force One](), [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) told the [Associated Press](): “We want power blue, not baby blue. Everything has its time and place. We’ll be changing the colors.”

#### Where is Trump today? How often does Trump visit Florida on Air Force One?

If you don’t know, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s primary residence is at [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) in [Palm Beach](), [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/). During his first presidency, it was often referred to as the “[Southern White House]()” or "[Winter White House]()” because of the amount of time he spent here.

According to the [Palm Beach Daily News]() ([Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)'s other hometown newspaper besides the [Palm Beach Post]()) and [FAA]() [temporary flight restrictions]() "for VIP movements" issued this week, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is expected to arrive in [Palm Beach]() on Friday, April 11, and leave [Palm Beach]() on Sunday, April 13.

It will be his 10th visit to [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/) and the ninth to [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) since he was sworn in on Inauguration Day or Jan. 20, 2025.

Jan. 31 marked the first time he landed in [Florida](https://www.myflorida.gov/) on board [Air Force One]() since regaining the [White House]().

His last visit here before summer could be next weekend. The president typically visits [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) for Easter Sunday, according to coverage, then frequents his "[Summer White House]()" in [Bedminster](), [New Jersey](), until fall. But first, he and First Lady [Melania Trump]() will host the [White House]() [Easter Egg Roll]() on Monday, April 21.

#### Which sporting events did Trump attend via Air Force One when his term started in 2025?

President [Donald Trump has made high-profile](https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/trump/2025/04/04/trump-says-china-panicked-calls-for-interest-rate-cut/82862649007/) sporting events part of his legacy during his [second administration]().

Certain [members of the Trump family attended](https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/2025/02/10/trump-super-bowl-photos-ivanka-melania-barron-bettina-guilfoyle/78383425007/) with the president, including [Donald Trump Jr., his girlfriend Bettina Anderson](https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/2025/02/09/trump-super-bowl-photos-ivanka-melania-barron-bettina-guilfoyle/78378818007/), and three of his children with ex-wife Vanessa Trump; Ivanka Trump and her son Theo Trump; Eric and Lara Trump.

Wearing a black [SpaceX hoodie, Tesla CEO Elon Musk](https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/2025/03/23/trump-elon-musk-spacex-hoodie-ncaa-wrestling-melania/82626378007/), leader of the [Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)](https://www.doge.gov/), and [Susie Wiles](), [White House chief of staff, sat with Trump in the VIP area.

He made headlines for landing his helicopter, [Marine One](), on the golf course.
