excerpt: "It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas. Everywhere you go, take a look at the sycophants. They're griftering again with MAGA caps and crypto-coins aglow. It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas. Toadies on every floor. But the scariest sight you'll see, Is Patel and Pam Bondi At your door."
