A PROCLAMATION

This proclamation ends a grave national injustice that has been perpetrated upon the American people over the last four years and begins a process of national reconciliation.

Acting pursuant to the grant of authority in Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution of the United States, I do hereby:

(a)  commute the sentences of the following individuals convicted of offenses related to events that occurred at or near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021, to time served as of January 20, 2025:

•    [Stewart Rhodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Rhodes)

•    [Kelly Meggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Meggs)

•    Kenneth Harrelson (Titusville, FL)

•    Thomas Caldwell

•    Jessica Watkins[^151] (Woodstock, OH)

[^151]: Interesting that how much Trump hates transgender people, that he pardoned a transgender Oath Keeper.

•    [Roberto Minuta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Minuta)

•    Edward Vallejo (Phoenix, AR)

•    David Moerschel (Punta Gorda, FL)

(b)  grant a full, complete and unconditional pardon to all other individuals convicted of offenses related to events that occurred at or near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021;

The Attorney General shall administer and effectuate the immediate issuance of certificates of pardon to all individuals described in section (b) above, and shall ensure that all individuals convicted of offenses related to events that occurred at or near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021, who are currently held in prison are released immediately.  The Bureau of Prisons shall immediately implement all instructions from the Department of Justice regarding this directive.

I further direct the Attorney General to pursue dismissal with prejudice to the government of all pending indictments against individuals for their conduct related to the events at or near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021.  The Bureau of Prisons shall immediately implement all instructions from the Department of Justice regarding this directive.

<p style="text-align: center">IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this</p>
