Feb 26, 2025  #Cabinet #Trump #ElonMusk
Donald Trump was praised for answering more questions in his first month than Presidents Biden and Obama answered in their first months. But as MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell notes, a lie is not an answer. And now, having watched how easy it is for Donald Trump to lie to reporters, Elon Musk has decided to do the exact same thing, Lawrence explains.
- RFKJr: measles does not kill children. His kids are vaccinated.
- a child died from measles. RFKJr testimony: not a big deal
- cabinet meeting: Musk at cabinet meeting, not a member
- Musk invested in an electric car company. He did not invent electric cars. Lawrence: "Musk is not from here"
- Trump may not be the most ignorant person in meeting
- lies are lies, not answers
- Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid won't be touched. $800B cut from Medicaid

“This is what Republicans are doing now: going against all of their strongest convictions about America’s role in the world—about the threat of Russia, the threat of Putin—to bend the knee to Trump,” says Jen Psaki on Republicans like Marco Rubio, Lindsey Graham and Mike Waltz.
- Graham: Putin is afraid of Trump 😄
- Sen. Chris Coons (D-): Trump is standing on its head how Trumpian colleagues felt and supported Ukraine before Trump
- good at turning themselves into pretzels
- logic to give Russia parts of Ukraine that he wants, cut back Ukraine aid, puts Russia in a tougher position to negotiate doesn't make sense
- if we lose Ukraine, Trump will be the biggest loser of the 21st century

Feb 26, 2025  #Cabinet #Trump #ElonMusk
Donald Trump was praised for answering more questions in his first month than Presidents Biden and Obama answered in their first months.

- cabinet meeting: Musk at cabinet meeting, not a member
- Musk invested in an electric car company. He did not invent electric cars. Lawrence: "Musk is not from here"
- Trump may not be the most ignorant person in meeting
- lies are lies, not answers

“This is what Republicans are doing now: going against all of their strongest convictions about America’s role in the world—about the threat of Russia, the threat of Putin—to bend the knee to Trump,” says Jen Psaki on Republicans like Marco Rubio, Lindsey Graham and Mike Waltz.

- Sen. Chris Coons (D-): Trump is standing on its head how Trumpian colleagues felt and supported Ukraine before Trump
