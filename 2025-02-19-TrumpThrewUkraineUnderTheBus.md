If [Russian](http://government.ru/) wasn't hemorrhaging soldiers, [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), just gave his buddy, [Vlad](http://kremlin.ru/) a green light to invade [NATO](https://www.nato.int/) countries.

KYIV, [Ukraine](https://www..gov.ua/) (AP) — [President Donald Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) this week falsely blamed [Ukraine](https://www..gov.ua/) for starting the war that has cost tens of thousands of [Ukrainian](https://www..gov.ua/) lives, causing outrage and alarm in a country that has spent nearly three years fighting back a much larger [Russian](http://government.ru/) military.

[Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) called [Ukrainian](https://www..gov.ua/) [President Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://www.president.gov.ua/) “ a dictator without elections” and claimed his support among voters was near rock-bottom.

[Zelenskyy](https://www.president.gov.ua/) said Wednesday that the disinformation is coming from [Russia](http://government.ru/), and some of what [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has said does echo [Russia](http://government.ru/)’s own narrative of the conflict.

Here’s a look at some of [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/)’s statements:

### [Ukraine](https://www..gov.ua/) ‘should have never started it’

**WHAT [TRUMP](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) SAID**: “You’ve been there for three years. You should have ended it ... You should have never started it. You could have made a deal.”

**THE FACTS**: [Russia](http://government.ru/)’s army crossed the border on Feb. 24, 2022, in an all-out invasion that [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/) sought to justify by falsely saying it was needed to protect [Russian-speaking civilians](http://government.ru/) in eastern [Ukraine](https://www..gov.ua/) and prevent the country from joining [NATO](https://www.nato.int/).

But [Russia's](http://government.ru/) aggression against [Ukraine](https://www..gov.ua/) didn’t start then. In 2014, [Russian](http://government.ru/) [President Vladimir Putin](http://kremlin.ru/) saw signs that [Ukraine](https://www..gov.ua/) was pulling away from [Russia](http://government.ru/)’s sphere of influence, seeking alliances with western European nations.

[Putin](http://kremlin.ru/) illegally annexed the Crimean Peninsula and started an armed aggression in the eastern [Ukrainian](https://www..gov.ua/) region of Donbas that grew into a long-running conflict that left thousands dead.

That conflict simmered until 2022, when [Putin](http://kremlin.ru/) ordered what he called military exercises along [Ukraine's](https://www..gov.ua/) borders. He told the world that the roughly 150,000 soldiers that he had amassed would not be used to invade [Ukraine](https://www..gov.ua/). But in the early hours of Feb. 24, [Russia](http://government.ru/) launched widespread airstrikes and soldiers began pouring over the border.

### [Ukraine](https://www..gov.ua/) should hold elections

**WHAT [TRUMP](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) SAID**: “We have a situation where we haven’t had elections in [Ukraine](https://www..gov.ua/), where we have martial law,” [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) said in Mar-a-Lago, adding on Wednesday in a post on social media: “A Dictator without Elections, [Zelenskyy](https://www.president.gov.ua/) better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left.”

**THE FACTS**: [Zelenskyy](https://www.president.gov.ua/) was elected to a five-year term in 2019, and the next presidential elections had been scheduled for spring 2024. But [Ukrainian](https://www..gov.ua/) law prohibits parliamentary or presidential elections during a state of martial law, so [Zelenskyy](https://www.president.gov.ua/) has remained in office. He has said he believes elections will be held in [Ukraine](https://www..gov.ua/) after martial law is lifted. The country would need to amend the law if it decided to hold a vote.

There are numerous factors that, according to [Ukraine's](https://www..gov.ua/) government, “would render it literally impossible to ensure a fair electoral process in the circumstances of a total war.”

According to the United Nations’ refugee agency, some 6.9 million [Ukrainian](https://www..gov.ua/) refugees have been registered worldwide since February 2022. Of those, millions remain outside the country due to the war. It would be nearly impossible for all of those who have been displaced to participate in an election, potentially robbing millions of their right to vote.

Furthermore, around 800,000 soldiers are currently serving in the [Ukrainian](https://www..gov.ua/) Armed Forces as they struggle to contain [Russian](http://government.ru/) advances. An election would necessitate pulling soldiers off the front lines to vote, weakening [Ukraine's](https://www..gov.ua/) military position. Additionally, those fighting would be unable to run for office, a right that is guaranteed to them by [Ukrainian](https://www..gov.ua/) law.

Many [Ukrainians](https://www..gov.ua/) are living in areas under [Russian](http://government.ru/) occupation, essentially precluding their participation in any electoral process. And since [Russia](http://government.ru/) continues to regularly strike both military and civilian targets across the country, packing millions of citizens into crowded polling places could create additional danger.

### [Zelenskyy](https://www.president.gov.ua/)’s support at rock bottom?

**WHAT [TRUMP](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) SAID**: “The leader in [Ukraine](https://www..gov.ua/), I mean, I hate to say it, but he’s down at 4% approval rating.”

**THE FACTS**: [Zelenskyy](https://www.president.gov.ua/) “retains a fairly high level of public trust” — about 57 percent - according to a report released Wednesday by the [Kyiv International Institution of Sociology](https://kiis.com.ua/), whose executive director is Anton Hrushetskyi.

Speaking in Kyiv on Wednesday, [Zelenskyy](https://www.president.gov.ua/) said the number given by [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/), for which the president cited no sources, was “disinformation” that originated in [Russia](http://government.ru/), and that the president “unfortunately lives in this disinformation space.”

[Zelenskyy](https://www.president.gov.ua/) said he will ask pollsters in the coming weeks to conduct surveys on the public’s trust in him and share the results with the [Trump a dministration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) .

### Millions of deaths
**WHAT [TRUMP](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) SAID**: “When you see what’s taken place in [Ukraine](https://www..gov.ua/) with millions of people killed, including the soldiers, millions of people killed, a big percentage of their cities knocked down to the ground, I don’t know how anybody even lives there.”


**THE FACTS**: No estimates by any reputable analysis place deaths near the millions.

While exact figures of the number of deaths are unknown, [Zelenskyy](https://www.president.gov.ua/) said earlier this month that over 46,000 [Ukrainian](https://www..gov.ua/) soldiers had been killed since the start of the full-scale war in February 2022. He has also said that “tens of thousands of civilians” had been killed in occupied areas of [Ukraine](https://www..gov.ua/), but that no exact figures would be available until the war was over. The most recent data from the [Russian](http://government.ru/) [Defense Ministry](http://government.ru/department/94/events/), published in January 2023, pointed to just over 6,000 military deaths, although reports from [U.S.](https://www.usa.gov/) and [U.K.](https;//www.gov.uk/) officials put that number significantly higher.
