## ['Donald 'Forrest' Trump's humiliating tariff climbdown is a panicked retreat dressed up as victory'](https://www.themirror.com/news/politics/forrest-trumps-humiliating-tariff-climbdown-1082642)

Opinion by Christopher Bucktin. April 9, 2025

In the latest twist of political theater, 'Forrest [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)' reminded the world that "stupid is, as stupid does," as he paused his [economically reckless tariff crusade](https://www.themirror.com/news/politics/trump-warned-trade-china-could-1082603) for 90 days. Meanwhile, [Elon Musk looks 'rattled' as he's brutally trolled during gaming livestream from his private jet](https://www.themirror.com/tech/gaming/elon-musk-mocked-path-exile-1078287).

In the movies Tom Hank's famous character was shown to have far more business acumen than the US leader. But [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [has once again proven that his self-proclaimed genius is little more than a hollow myth](https://www.themirror.com/news/politics/breaking-dow-surges-massive-spike-1082524) built on bluster and bankruptcy.

His reckless tariff crusade, which he insisted would “[Make America Great Again](),” | [has instead triggered chaos across global markets](https://www.themirror.com/news/us-news/desperate-trump-pleads-companies-move-1081764), wiping out trillions in value and shaking investor confidence. It comes as [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is 'at risk of serious health condition' as photo shows stark change

And now, in a humiliating climbdown, he has announced a 90-day pause on his disastrous trade war - a desperate face-saving exercise cloaked as strategy.

Let’s be clear: this is not a calculated move by a master negotiator.

This is a panicked retreat by a man who doesn’t understand the very basics of international trade or economic cause and effect.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s approach to tariffs has been as simplistic as it is catastrophic - slap them on, bark about winning, and expect the rest of the world to capitulate.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s approach to tariffs has been as simplistic as it is catastrophic - slap them on, bark about winning, and expect the rest of the world to capitulate.

'I think it's been awful': >Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) voters weigh in on tariffs and the economy
But the world didn’t play along.

Nations like [China](https://www.cn.gov/) and the [European Union](https://commission.europa.eu/) didn’t fold; they hit back with their own countermeasures, sending shockwaves through American agriculture, manufacturing, and tech industries.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) seems genuinely baffled that other countries don’t operate like contestants on one of his reality shows.

He thought they’d buckle, maybe throw in a compliment or two while handing over economic concessions.

Instead, they retaliated with precision, exposing the paper-thin logic behind his tariffs and demonstrating that the global economy is not his personal playground.

This blunder isn’t an isolated miscalculation. It’s part of a long, embarrassing pattern.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)’s record in business is littered with failure - six bankruptcies, failed casinos, a fraudulent “university,” a defunct airline, and an endless string of flopped ventures.

If failure were a product, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) would have patented it. Yet somehow, he’s managed to con millions into believing he’s a financial wizard.

In truth, he’s perhaps the most economically illiterate president in US history.

And let’s not let his advisers off the hook.

The chorus of enablers around him - people who should know better - have fanned the flames of this trade war.

Either they’re too cowardly to challenge his whims, or they share his delusions. In either case, they’re complicit in the damage done.

Now, after markets tumbled and pressure mounted, [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has blinked.

The 90-day delay is not a show of strength. It’s an admission of failure. And yet, with characteristic gall, he will undoubtedly frame this debacle as a victory.

He’ll claim, as he already has, that countries are “kissing his ass” - a statement as vulgar as it is delusional.

In reality, no one is kissing anything. They’re rolling their eyes at a man whose presidency continues to careen from one economic misstep to the next.

This isn’t leadership. It’s not strategy. It’s a farcical bluff that’s finally being called out.

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) may try to spin his way out of this corner, but the truth is plain to see: this 90-day pause isn’t a triumph - it’s a surrender. And the world knows it.
