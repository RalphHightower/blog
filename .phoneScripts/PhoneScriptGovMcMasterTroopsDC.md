[(803) 734-2100 McMaster](tel:+1803734-2100)

Hello, Governor McMaster. My name is Ralph Hightower, and I’m a South Carolina resident 

I am deeply concerned about the dangerous precedent being set in Washington, D.C.

President Trump’s deployment of federal troops—without local consent—and his fast-tracking of gun permits in the capital is a volatile mix. It’s not public safety. It’s political theater with live ammunition.

We’ve seen this before: Kent State. Orangeburg. Peaceful, unarmed students gunned down by state forces. Now Trump is accelerating that same formula—right in our nation’s capital.

He’s not acting as President of the United States. He’s acting as President of the Divided States of America.

Governor, I’m asking you to publicly oppose this reckless federal overreach and recall our troops. South Carolina should not be complicit in a playbook that weaponizes fear and undermines constitutional order.

We need leadership that defends state sovereignty, not one that rubber-stamps authoritarian regimes.

## 📞 Voicemail Script: Governor McMaster

Hi, this is Ralph Hightower from Chapin. I’m calling to urge Governor McMaster to publicly oppose President Trump’s federal troop deployment in D.C. and his reckless push to flood the city with firearms.

We’ve seen this playbook before—Kent State, Orangeburg—where peaceful, unarmed students were gunned down by state forces. Trump is recreating that formula in our capital.

He’s not the President of the United States. He’s the President of the Divided States of America.

South Carolina should not be complicit. Please speak out and recall our troops.

Thank you.
