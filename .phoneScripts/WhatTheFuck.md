Hello, my name is Ralph Hightower, and I’m a constituent from Chapin, South Carolina.

I am outraged by what I’m seeing in America.

ICE is out of control—ambushing parents at school drop-off lines, targeting people based on skin color, yanking individuals from cars without asking for identification. These actions presume guilt until proven innocent. That’s not law enforcement. That’s state-sponsored profiling.

Are Americans now expected to carry passports at all times? Is this the country we’ve become?

So I ask you directly: Where is the red line?

When will you say “Enough”? When will you publicly declare that this is not who we are?

- [x] Wilson [\+1 (803) 939-0041](tel:+18039390041)
Congressman Wilson: Will you speak out against racial profiling and unconstitutional enforcement tactics?
_No "thank you." No "I'll pass you comments on." Hang up with no acknowledgement._ 

- [x] Graham [\+1 (202) 224-5972](tel:+12022245972)
Senator Graham: Will you defend due process and the presumption of innocence?
_Took message and thank you._

- [x] Scott [\+1 (202) 224-6121](tel:+12022246121)
Senator Scott: Will you stand up for civil liberties and demand oversight?
_Left message._ 

And here in South Carolina:

- [x] McMaster [\+1 (803) 734-2100](tel:+18037342100)
Governor McMaster: Will you refuse to let ICE operate unchecked in our communities?
_Left message in two parts. Apparently, there is a time limit on messages._

- [x] AG Wilson [\+1 (803) 734-3953](tel:+18037373953)
Attorney General Wilson: Will you investigate these abuses and protect South Carolinians from federal overreach?
_Left message._ 

This is not a partisan issue. It’s a moral one. It’s a constitutional one.

I expect a public statement. I expect action. Because silence is complicity.
