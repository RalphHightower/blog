[(803) 734-2100 McMaster](tel:+1803734-2100)
Hi, I'm Ralph Hightower from Chapin. I'm calling to see if Governor McMaster can change Trump’s mind on tariffs. 

Since President Trump appointed then Lt. Governor McMaster to Governor, Governor McMaster probably has his personal cellphone number, I'm calling to ask Governor McMaster to urge Trump to end his tariffs and trade war with the world. 

Various economists have warned that Trump’s tariffs may cause stagflation; that hasn’t occurred since the 70's. The Federal Reserve doesn't have anything in their toolbox to fix stagflation. They have tools to combat a Trump-cession and Trump-flation. Besides, Trump's "America First" policy is isolating us, turning to "America Alone".
