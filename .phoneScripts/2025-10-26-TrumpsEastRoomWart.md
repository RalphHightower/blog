Okay, I'll admit it. Trump had me fooled when he said that he wasn’t going to touch the White House while building his guilded, ostentatious ballroom. Last week, he destroyed the East Wing, which gave the White House a symmetry.

I was going to let this destruction slide, but news reports after news reports mention that the White House is the people's house. Trump is just a tenant. This is wanton, wholesale destruction to build an edifice, dedicated to Trump’s delusion of grandeur. The destruction was done without forethought or planning, releasing dust clouds of asbestos. 

There is Federal property that can satisfy Trump’s desires for hosting the crowds that Trump imagines that is already built. It's the Ronald Reagan Center at 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue.
