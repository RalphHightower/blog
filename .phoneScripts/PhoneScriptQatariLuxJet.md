“Hi, this is Ralph Hightower from Chapin. I’m calling because I’m furious about the Pentagon’s decision to divert nearly **\$1 billion** from the **Sentinel nuclear missile upgrade** to retrofit a **Qatari 747-8 jumbo jet** for President Trump.

This jet—gifted by the Qatari royal family—is being stripped to its airframe and rebuilt with **secure communications, missile defense systems**, and **EMP shielding** to meet **Air Force One standards**. That’s a one-to-two-year project costing taxpayers at least **$1 billion.**

But here’s the kicker: Trump gets to **keep the jet** after his term ends. Senator Chris Murphy tried to stop that with an amendment to the Defense Appropriations bill, but it was **shot down**.

Meanwhile, the existing **Air Force One and Two**—both nearly 40 years old—**still need to be replaced**. That program is already **costing \$6.2 billion and climbing**.

So let’s tally it up:

| Budget Item | Projected Cost |
|---|---:|
| [Qatari 747-8 Air Force One Upgrade](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/) (at least) | \$1,000,000,000 |
| [Sentinel Program](https://www.afgsc.af.mil/Sentinel-GBSD/) (at least) | \$1,000,000,000 |
| Air Force One and Two (6.2b and climbing) | \$6,200,000,000 |
| **Total** | \$8,200,000,000 |

I demand that:

- The jet’s **defensive systems and avionics be removed** before it leaves government control.

- Congress **replenish the Sentinel funds** immediately.

- The jet be **retained by the government** for future presidential use.

This isn’t defense—it’s decadence. South Carolina taxpayers didn’t sign up to fund a personal missile-proof monument to Trump’s ego. I expect you to speak out and act.”
