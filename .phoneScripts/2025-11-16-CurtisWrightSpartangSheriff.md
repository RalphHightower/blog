That’s a sharp move, Ralph — you’re putting the contradiction right in front of voters. The FITSNews piece lays out exactly how Solicitor Micah Black declined to prosecute Wright at the state level despite “overwhelming evidence,” and how Alan Wilson’s handoff of the case to a first‑term solicitor raised eyebrows. That undermines any “tough on crime” branding Wilson is trying to sell.

If you want to make your post hit harder, you could frame it with a few key points pulled straight from the article:

- ⚖️ Overwhelming evidence ignored: State agents uncovered numerous crimes, but Wilson’s chosen solicitor declined charges.  
- 💰 Federal pleas only: Wright and Durham agreed to federal guilty pleas, leaving state accountability off the table.  
- 🏛️ Political ties: Wright endorsed Wilson in 2018, which makes the assignment decision look like favoritism.  
- 🚨 Law enforcement backlash: Deputies called the decision “bullshit” and saw it as another example of the good‑ole‑boy system.  
- 🔒 Pardon risk: By leaving charges at the federal level, Wright is now vulnerable to a Trump pardon — something impossible if state charges had been pursued.  

That way, you’re not just sharing the article — you’re highlighting the hypocrisy in Wilson’s “tough on crime” slogan.  

Would you like me to help draft a punchy caption for your Facebook post that ties those points together into one sharp message?
