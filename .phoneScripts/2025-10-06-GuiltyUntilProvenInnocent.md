Hi, my name is Ralph Hightower from Chapin, South Carolina. 

Governor McMaster was a junior at USC when the Orangeburg Massacre happened. I was in high school at Bamberg-Ehrhardt, where the Guard was housed in our gym. We both remember what happens when state power is turned against its own people. And now, in Trump’s America, everyone is guilty until proven innocent. As a lawyer, he should know that’s not just wrong—it’s unconstitutional.

President Trump is trampling on our Constitutional rights and civil liberties, trying to spark a con​fla​gra​tion to invoke the Insurrection Act. The deployment of Guard troops for political theater is not just reckless—it’s a betrayal of the oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.

I dissent.

Hi, my name is Ralph Hightower, and I’m calling from Chapin, South Carolina.

I’m outraged by the militarized raid in Chicago last week—Black Hawk helicopters, doors smashed, apartments ransacked, residents dragged into the streets half-clothed, children separated from their parents. This wasn’t law enforcement. It was a war zone.

In Trump’s America, everyone is guilty until proven innocent. This is not public safety—it’s collective punishment.

I’m calling to demand:

- A full public accounting of the raid: who authorized it, what legal basis was used, and what oversight exists.
- Immediate protections for the residents affected, including legal aid, housing support, and trauma services.
- Congressional hearings into the use of military tactics on U.S. soil against civilians.

This is a constitutional emergency. If leadership cannot restrain this abuse, then it’s time to invoke the 25th Amendment.

We are not a nation of broken glass and broken families. We are a nation of laws. And I expect congressman/senator to act like it.

Thank you.
