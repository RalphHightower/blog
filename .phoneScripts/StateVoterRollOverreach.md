## Advocacy Call Script: Defending State Control of Voter Rolls

### INTRODUCTION 

Hi, my name is Ralph Hightower, a constituent from Chapin. I’m calling today because I’m deeply concerned about recent federal efforts from the Trump administration and Pam Bondi—to pressure states into handing over their voter registration data.

### CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERN 

The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) requires states to maintain a centralized voter registration system—but it does not authorize the federal government to demand access to those rolls. This push is not only legally dubious—it’s a direct affront to state sovereignty and voter privacy.

### CALL TO ACTION 

I’m asking you to publicly affirm South Carolina’s right to control its own voter data.

Will you commit to resisting any federal attempt to commandeer our voter rolls?

Will you issue a statement clarifying that South Carolina will not comply with unconstitutional demands for voter data?

### CLOSING 

This is about more than politics—it’s about protecting the integrity of our elections and the rights of our citizens. I hope you’ll stand firm. Thank you for your time.

## Voicemail Script: Defending Voter Data Sovereignty

Hi, this is Ralph Hightower from Chapin. I’m calling to urge you to reject any federal attempt to seize South Carolina’s voter registration data. The Help America Vote Act gives states control—not Washington. Please stand firm and protect our voter privacy and state sovereignty. Thank you.
