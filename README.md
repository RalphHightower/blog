# Reason for Starting a Blog

I started my blog because I realized that maintaining my opinion that [Donald
Trump Is a Fucking Idiot](https://ralphhightower.github.io/RalphHightower/Opinions/DonaldTrumpIsAFuckingIdiot.html)
was going to be unwieldy to update and maintain. You may have a different opinion
from mine. But the only person that can convince me that Trump is not a fucking
idiot is Donald Trump himself. I probably won't change your opinion or vote.
Likewise, you won't be able to change my assignment of Trump.

And no, I do not have Trump Derangement Syndrome[42]. My opinion of Trump hasn't 
wavered from when he first announced his presidential run. He's still a fucking
idiot.

At least,  I don't belong to a cult or have RTD[^43].

Both political parties fucked up in 2016.

- The Democrats chose Hillary because it was *"her turn."*
- The Republicans chose the candidate, Donald Trump, that was, and still is, unfit and unqualified to be president.[^41]

Both candidates are polarizing!

[^41]: Trump meets the constitutional age requirement, but that's saying little.

## Third Rate Game Show Host

I thought that it was a publicity when Trump announced that he was running for
president. Trump has neither the qualifications nor the temperament to be
president. My assessment has not wavered from 2016. America must not renew
"The Apprentice: White House" for a second season.

"The Apprentice: White House" ended a tumultuous four year season ingloriously
in January 2020, in an extraordinary low point in American history when
thousands of far-right undesirables lay siege on the US Capitol in a vain
attempt to overthrow a fair election.

### Donald Trump Needs to Change His Behavior and Demeanor

***How?***

- Tame your temper! Quit throwing **Trumper Tantrums!**
- Quit your pathological lying and tell the **God-damned truth!**
- Start treating people with **respect!** I.e., quit that childish behavior of calling people names and acting like a school-yard bully.
- Be a true leader! A true leader recognizes team members, and subordinates for their accomplishment, and accepts the blame when things fail. A true leader does not use intimidation and fear.
- Quit your whining, *"It's not fair"* Grow up and be an adult!
- Accept the fact that the president lives under a **microscope.** You will be praised by some and condemned others for your actions or inactions.

Trump keeps boasting that he is a highly intelligent person. As Brad Pitt said
in the movie, Moneyball, "Show me the money!". In Trump’s case, I say "Show
me your Mensa test score!". If you're short on cash, I'll even pay the $99 for
you to [take the Mensa Admission Test](https://www.us.mensa.org/join/testing/).

But you more than likely won't own up to my challenge to you. It'll probably
be for the same reason that you won't reveal your [Internal Revenue
Service](https://www.irs.gov/) tax returns as presidents have done as
past precedent. You're afraid that revealing that information will prove
that you are a fraud.

### Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas

I also think that [Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas should be
impeached](https://ralphhightower.github.io/RalphHightower/Opinions/ImpeachSCOTUSJusticeClarenceThomas.html)
because he is ethically financial challenged.

## Briefly About Me

I freeze time; I photograph. I have 50++ years of computer programming and
software development; most recently using C# and .Net. Athough I am retired
from software development as a vocation, I am still active for personal
projects. I have witnessed two final space flights: the US half of the
Apollo/Soyuz Test Project, and Space Shuttle STS-135 Atlantis with the
Final Four \[CDR Chris Ferguson, PLT Doug Hurley, MS1 Sandra Magnus, MS2
Rex Walheim\], as well as the final landing next to the control tower of
the Shuttle Landing Facility (200 yards from the runway).

Photography is another creative endeavor that I have enjoyed since 1980. My
first camera was the Canon A-1 which was an innovative camera for the 80's,
which I still use. I added one of my bucket list cameras in July 2013, a
Canon New F-1 with the AE Finder FN and the AE Motor Drive FN. December 2013,
I added a DSLR, the Canon 5D Mark III with the EF 24-105mm f4L. I enjoy
photography period. It doesn't matter if I am shooting film or digital.

[^12]: People with INTP preferences are quiet, thoughtful, and analytical. They tend to put a great deal of consideration into everything they do. INTPs are generally easygoing and genuine. They might seem to “zone out” from time to time while they consider new concepts or explore how something works. They are often happiest laying low and working hard behind the scenes. While they may seem impersonal with people they don’t know well, they like to have a close group of people they open up to. They are naturally adept at building structural models or coming up with new concepts for solving problems. They tend to see the world as a system that can be analyzed, and this is how they approach just about everything in life.<br />• 4.8% of the population • 5.8% of men • 4.0% of women •<br />× analytical × conceptual × logical ×<br />× quiet × independent × easygoing ×<br />× complex × driven × curious ×<br />× questioning × methodical × values competence ×<br />× self-critical × thoughtful × innovative ×<br />× problem solver × reflective × autonomous ×
[^13]: I had to Google the GOT Personality Test. Oh, I don't subscribe to HBO, so all I know of Game of Thrones is that's it's sorta like King Arthur set in medieval times.<br />I took the GOT Personality Test. I saw that reference in a LinkedIn news article about using personality tests to get the right balance of different personalities. I think using a personality test to determine employment is a form of discrimination and I use that rather strictly because there's race discrimination and gender discrimination.
[^14]: Primary Character: Mance Rayder <br />Nickname: King Beyond the Wall<br />Traits: Inspiring, Formidable, Pioneer<br />Your primary character is Mance Rayder. You are a charismatic, calm, and determined man with strong leadership qualities. You tend to rise quickly through the ranks of any organization you enter. You have good social and diplomatic skills, allowing you to collaborate with many different types of people. You have an honest yet stern persona which earns you respect and admiration of those around you. You are very trusting which can be your greatest weakness. You value freedom above all else.
[^15]: Secondary Character: Ser Jaime Lannister<br />Nickname: The Kingslayer<br />Traits: Arrogant, Sarcastic, Apathetic<br />Your secondary character is Ser Jaime Lannister. You are charming and capable of impeccable politeness in the right circumstances. In the wrong circumstances, others perceive you to be disdainful, sarcastic and arrogant. However your arrogance may just be confidence, as you excel in a number of areas, including intelligence. You don't mock others over minor failings but you are usually very blunt. You typically just say what you are thinking without regard to the feelings of those that you perceive as incompetent. You regard ruthlessness as a virtue and behave in an unapologetically amoral way. You're not politically ambitious and sly maneuvering is not your way.
