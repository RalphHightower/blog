##### [The Boring Company fined by TCEQ for pollution violations](https://www.mysanantonio.com/business/article/boring-company-tceq-fine-19523328.php)
*Residents have been calling out pollution concerns for years.*

\$11,876 penalty for violations
October 2023, The Boring Company faced four water quality-related violations

- failed to implement effective erosion and sediment controls to minimize the discharge of pollutants
- did not stabilize areas where construction has stopped.
- failed to obtain a permit to prevent the dumping of concrete truck wash out and stormwater

*Working in the darkness beneath the Las Vegas Strip didn’t keep Elon Musk’s The Boring Co. out of sight of a new investigation into the environmental, health, and safety violations it has so far committed during the construction of the Vegas Loop transportation system.*

- A 2019 citation for discharging groundwater into storm drains without a permit, which resulted in a $90K fine from the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection
- A 2022 citation by local officials for illegally connecting to a sewer without approval, with no fine assessed
- A 2023 finding by Clark County that Boring tunneled without permits to work on county property, after which the county allowed the company to file for the permits retroactively and pay a $900 fine for each one.
- A 2024 violation resulting from an unsecured Boring truck that spilled hazardous material all over the I-15 — closing it down for four hours during rush hour — which resulted in a fine of only \$75 (that’s with no K) to the driver.

##### [Elon Musk's Boring Co. Slapped With More Environmental Violations](https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2023-10-13/elon-musks-boring-co-slapped-with-more-environmental-violations/)

*We Musk ask you to follow the law. Elon Musk is upset he can't pollute more*
By Lina Fisher, Fri., Oct. 13, 2023
Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, Clean Water Act:
 - four violations relating to the Boring Co.'s management of stormwater runoff. 
 - According to the TCEQ, the Boring Co. was 
 - discharging stormwater associated with industrial activities before obtaining a permit, 
 - has failed to put in place erosion controls, 
 - has not stabilized areas disturbed by temporary construction
 - isn't controlling runoff from its concrete truck washing stations

all of which sits right by the Colorado River.

April 2023:
- three violations relating to stormwater controls
    - two moderate
    - one minor
2022:
- two major violations for untreated wastewater drainage were labeled "major," which TCEQ defines as "when human health or the environment" is exposed to risky pollutants.

In March, the company applied to dump close to 150,000 gallons of wastewater into the Colorado River until a new wastewater treatment plant is built in 2025, to widespread outcry. Bastrop County has also issued the Boring Co. a violation for an unpermitted septic system. These repeat violations are "serious enough to warrant an enforcement action," according to the TCEQ's website, in which TCEQ can enforce correction of the violations and seek penalties, either through an order issued by TCEQ commissioners or by referring the case to the Office of the Attorney General for litigation. No enforcement action has been scheduled yet.
