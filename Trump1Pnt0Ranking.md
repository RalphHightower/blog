@RalphHightower: [President Joe Biden](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/) was not ranked in this 2021 survey as his term was just beginning. I'm interested in where [Trump 2.0](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) ranks since his performance is drastically worse than [Trump 1.0](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/). Even his ranking in MAGALandia is underwater. 

[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com) did a [Sergeant Schultz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Banner)[^11] when asked about [Project 2025](https://www.project2025.org/). However, the [Authors of Mass Destruction: Project 2025]({% link Project2025AuthorsOfDestruction.md %}) published a blueprint for the systematic destruction of democracy and the [United States](https://constitution.congress.gov/).

[^1701]: @RalphHightower: Interestingly, [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) ranks dead last in the category of Moral Authority.

Overall, Trump ranks 41 of 44, above Franklin Pierce (42),  Andrew Johnson (43), and James Buchanan (44)
